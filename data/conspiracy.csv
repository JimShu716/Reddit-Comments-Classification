Yes and no. You can definitely buy heavier firepower, and you can even buy old tanks, fighter jets, etc. but not only are most of the current models absolutely inaccessible to civilians, we also lack the infrastructure and materials to maintain and supply them in any kind of extended combat setting. I guess really my point is just that it's odd to hear people argue that they need these guns to defend themselves against the government when those guns wouldn't even begin to prepare them for a plausible defense against the military. At this point, it might not even be enough to fend off the police force. It just seems like asking for a pocket knife in case a rhino attacks you. Sure, by all means take the knife, but if you're genuinely concerned about preparing for a rhino attack, it doesn't seem like a pocket knife will really make that much of a difference.

Conspiracy related: Our medical system is broken. Symptoms are ""treated"" with pharmaceuticals while most underlying causes *other than obvious traumas or physical anomalies* remain in the dark.


I have spent more than half my life struggling with back and joint issues, and all that severe chronic pain subsequently adds to the mix. I've had enough xrays to heat a hotpocket. I've had (full spine, and main joint) MRIs that show little evidence of physical anomalies. (*Granted, they seemed to be rather low-res broad scans and could be missing something.*)

I have tried increased exercise, diets, supplements, neuro meds, SSRIs, etc. and the *only* thing that has alleviated most of my disabling pain is atypically high doses of opiates. While they allow me to maintain basic physical activities, and provide periods of clear thought to navigate the never ending challenges in my healthcare and plight for subsistence assistance, my life has become a hellish prison.


Sensing that I am likely not the only person facing such challenges, I honestly feel like I and my physicians are missing something.

3036,"&gt; Because the problem wasn't as obvious to lawmakers at the time. Technology is constantly changing, and it's only in recent years that the internet has become fast enough for companies like Netflix to emerge and become viable competitors for cable and satellite TV. Even outside of their feud with Netflix, they began throttling peer-to-peer transfer (torrents, online gaming), and began plans to intstitute data caps and allow ""preferred partners"" like The ISP's own video services or large companies that could afford the fee be exempt from them. Basically they started abusing their position more and more.

No. Netflix was throttled in 2012, not in 2015, the difference in technology and internet speeds in 2012 and 2015 is negligible.

&gt;I'd be interested to look this up because it's the first time I've heard this questions, but all I could really do is speculate. My suspicion is that there's more competition and/or less barriers to establish alternate routes if one company started throttling or sabotaging certain connections. It's possible that it's harder for them to get directly between a specific company and it's potential customers or less ability to profit from it.

Parts reminded me of a series of books by Penn Jones Jr. an editor of the Midlothian Mirror, a local small town newspaper. He collected stories of eyewitnesses who were ignored or treated poorly by law enforcement and the Warren commission, and then died in obscure ways within a few years of the assassination. He published four installments of Forgive My Grief.  These books, because of their local view and simple narratives first convinced me that the Warren commission was bogus.

At the end of the film no one in the theater would speak or look at each other. That experience led me to do a lot of reading on the topic. One of the best books I read was put together by a group of academics. Unfortunately I did not keep it nor do I remember the title. It was not a long book, around 200 pages, only 20 or so pages of introduction and explanation and the rest was speeches and articles from the times. The longest was a speech by Castro detailing the history of US intervention in Cuba since the revolution and his beliefs as to which parts of the shadow government took part in JFK's murder. Also included was the 'peace speech' JFK gave at a university commencement that spring. The first time I was aware of it, in that for me, pre-internet time. The focus of the book was not all the confusing details and minutiae of the event but the general tone of the times. It was convincing.

""Of all the pieces, I felt ‘Meistersinger’ was difficult for me to deal with because of the nature of the investigation of German culture and German identity and the history of the piece,' he said. The work’s finale is a monologue delivered by the opera’s hero, the cobbler Hans Sachs, that is a rousing defense of “holy German art,” and a warning that it must be safeguarded against foreign incursions.""

Ok so what is going on here? 

German Culture/Heritage is a bad thing? And since German= bad it's necessary to boycott 200 year old opera . And if you deride and censor you get rewarded with positive publicity and a worldwide audience, being led by the article into the idea Wagner, German Heritage, culture is terrible and evil and should be ignored and shamed. 

Why is it ok to malign entire cultures and nations like that, and not get challenged? Why is it socially acceptable to exclusively denigrate European heritage, art, and history?


This Opera dude who is the subject in the article later decided to do Wagner after all, once he figured out how to subvert it to his vision. 


2017. Being openly racist and hateful to European heritage is socially acceptable to the point that you earn a featured article in the NYT.  Imagine taking statements like these and applying them to any other racial group. 

If he despises Wagner so much why not use a celebrated opera composer who shares his heritage?  

The answer is opera was not an artistic medium in the rest of the world. 

Why make a career out of a medium that is entirely based and formed out of a heritage and history he hates?

http://time.com/91081/what-science-says-about-race-and-genetics/

&gt;A longstanding orthodoxy among social scientists holds that human races are a social construct and have no biological basis. A related assumption is that human evolution halted in the distant past, so long ago that evolutionary explanations need never be considered by historians or economists.

&gt;In the decade since the decoding of the human genome, a growing wealth of data has made clear that these two positions, never at all likely to begin with, are simply incorrect. There is indeed a biological basis for race. And it is now beyond doubt that human evolution is a continuous process that has proceeded vigorously within the last 30,000 years and almost certainly — though very recent evolution is hard to measure — throughout the historical period and up until the present day.

&gt;New analyses of the human genome have established that human evolution has been recent, copious, and regional. Biologists scanning the genome for evidence of natural selection have detected signals of many genes that have been favored by natural selection in the recent evolutionary past. No less than 14% of the human genome, according to one estimate, has changed under this recent evolutionary pressure.

&gt;Analysis of genomes from around the world establishes that there is a biological basis for race, despite the official statements to the contrary of leading social science organizations. An illustration of the point is the fact that with mixed race populations, such as African Americans, geneticists can now track along an individual’s genome, and assign each segment to an African or European ancestor, an exercise that would be impossible if race did not have some basis in biological reality.

&gt;Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity Dear Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, I am deeply concerned that the Pence-Kobach commission's recent request for private information about every voter in the country could be the first of many attempts to push nationwide voting restrictions. I'm glad that state election officials have put their duty to voters above this partisan attack on voters, and I want you to know that the American people will not be intimidated out of exercising our freedom to vote. The best way to uphold the integrity of our elections is by making sure every eligible voter can vote and have their vote counted as cast -- not using false claims about illegal voting to suppress votes. Modernizing our elections to allow things like automatic voter registration, Election Day voter registration, and early voting are important steps to lowering the barriers to participation for all Americans. The freedom to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy, and I know that We The People will do whatever it takes, together, to protect it. I will not let this Commission intimidate me or any other eligible American from exercising the freedom to vote.

Quote:

*The gravitational attraction force between two point masses is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separation distance. The force is always attractive and acts along the line joining them from their center.*

What this means in practice is that as the distance between two gravitational bodies increases, the strength of attraction between them drops off precipitiously. To cause any gravitational effects on the Earth, the body would need to be truly massive, or would need to pass extremely close. But if it is a small body, such as a comet, even if it kissed the surface of the Earth it would not be close enough to its center to actually produce any significant gravitational effect (the Earth is 4,000 miles in radius).

By mixing tritium with a chemical that emits light in the presence of radiation, a phosphor, a continuous light source is made. This can be applied to situations where a dim light is needed but where using batteries or electricity is not possible or practical. Rifle sights and exit signs are two examples of where this phenomenon is commonly used. The phosphor sights help increase nighttime firing accuracy and the exit signs can be life saver if there is a loss of power. The radioactive decay product of tritium is a low energy beta that cannot penetrate the outer dead layer of human skin. Therefore, the main hazard associated with tritium is internal exposure from inhalation or ingestion. In addition, due to the relatively long half life and short biological half life, an intake of tritium must be in large amounts to pose a significant health risk. Although, in keeping with the philosophy of ALARA, internal exposure should be kept as low as practical.

There are at least four primary threads of Freemasonry, not counting all of the look-alikes and pretenders (like the Chinese Freemasons and the crazy fly-by-night franchises of fake Masonry in urban America). Those four are:

* English Freemasonry (the largest single group, including many spin-offs that mutally reocgnized each other such as the major Grand Lodges in the US states, at least one Grand Lodge in each European nation, Australia and so on).
* ""Continental"" Freemasonry which started in France under the Grand Orient de France and has since spread to nearly every part of the globe under its primary auspices or related spinoffs like Le Droit Humain.
* Prince Hall Freemasonry in the United States which began under segregation as the ""black Lodges"" but are now a wholly distinct tradition, variously recognized or not by each state's mainstream Grand Lodge.
* Scandinavian Freemasonry is a hybrid of traditions that came out of France combined with the state Lutheran Churches of most Scandinavian countries. Very much a Christian-only spin on Freemasonry with a distinct look and allegorical basis. Recognized by the English Grand Lodges.

This doesn't count all of the side-orders and secondary groups like the Shriners, Scottish Rite, etc., all of which tend to be duplicated within each strain except for the Scandinavian traditions where they have a much more linear system of 10 degrees and few if any side-orders.

American people will not be intimidated out of exercising our freedom
to vote.
The best way to uphold the integrity of our elections is by making sure
every eligible voter can vote and have their vote counted as cast --
not using false claims about illegal voting to suppress votes.
Modernizing our elections to allow things like automatic voter
registration, Election Day voter registration, and early voting are
important steps to lowering the barriers to participation for all
Americans.
The freedom to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy, and I know
that We The People will do whatever it takes, together, to protect it.
I will not let this Commission intimidate me or any other eligible
American from exercising the freedom to vote.

15255,"Alright like I said, HAARP isn't the only system of it's kind. There's the Duga radar in Russia, aka ""Russian Woodpecker"".

&gt; The Duga systems were extremely powerful, over 10 MW in some cases, and broadcast in the shortwave radio bands. They appeared without warning, ***sounding like a sharp, repetitive tapping noise at 10 Hz***, which led to it being nicknamed by shortwave listeners the Russian Woodpecker. The random frequency hops disrupted legitimate broadcasts, amateur radio operations, oceanic commercial aviation communications, utility transmissions, and resulted in thousands of complaints by many countries worldwide.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duga_radar

Google ""10hz on the brain"":

&gt; A 10 Hz rhythm is present in the occipital cortex when the eyes are closed (alpha waves), in the precentral cortex at rest (mu rhythm), in the superior and middle temporal lobe (tau rhythm), in the inferior olive (projection to cerebellar cortex), and in physiological tremor (underlying all voluntary movement).  These are all considered resting rhythms in the waking brain which are “replaced” by higher frequency activity with sensorimotor stimulation.  That is, the 10 Hz frequency fulcrum is replaced on the one hand by lower frequencies during sleep, or on the other hand by higher frequencies during volition and cognition.

&gt; For example, it is known that an identical auditory stimulus evokes a similar cortical response during waking and sleep. However, the perception of the stimulus varies as a function of the arousal state: A stimulus that can be perceived during waking cannot be perceived during sleep.  Underlying this variation in response is a difference in the background frequency, or “context” of the brain, characteristic of waking and sleep states.  During alert waking, it is possible to generate high frequency background activity (~40 Hz gamma band) to facilitate the recognition and integration of stimuli. Yet while asleep, a low frequency background activity (~4 Hz delta band) predominates and, ultimately, negates the ability of the brain to recognize or associate meaning with the stimulus.  Centered amidst this dichotomy are ~10 Hz alpha waves, a veritable fulcrum situated between functional states, a waveform that demarcates the functional shifts between large and small scale ensemble activity. 

https://oatext.com/The-10-Hz-frequency-A-fulcrum-for-transitional-brain-states.php

And also:

&gt; The specific ELF frequencies I was interested in studying are 6-10 Hertz. These frequencies are the same as those produced by the human brain in the theta and alpha states. Generally, specific brain wave frequency ranges can be associated with mood or thought patterns. Frequencies below 8 Hertz are considered theta waves. While these seem to be some of the least understood frequencies, they also seem to be associated with creative, insightful thought. When an artist or scientist has the ""aha"" experience, there's a good chance he or she is in theta. Alpha frequencies are from 8 to 12 Hertz and are commonly associated with relaxed, meditative states.

Name another system as good as capitalism, you can't. Venezuela collapsing is from moving away from capitalism and towards a more communistic system - which is pretty much exactly what you're advocating. You're just rebranding the name. 

This is partially true. The government isn't interested in an economic system that works. The government know exactly how to make this economy boom but is unwilling to do it. The truth is that Capatalism is the absolute best way to rob society because it all looks so good on paper. This way, the people don't complain and the government extracts cash and energy out of the economy without hindrance. So ya, in that way, Capatlism is the best system. Its the easiest on sleeping humans while extremely profitable for the cabal until the humans wake up and realize they were robbed blind of course. 

&gt;I didn't misread anything. You stated in your second point that people would have to continue working their jobs for a year whenever your system is implemented. Your words not mine. By the way nothing is stopping people from deciding what jobs they want to do now. Western culture has the greatest mobility of any culture because people have the freedom to choose what they want to do and as long as they are good enough at it to make money they can continue doing it. 

I was only recommending that people stick to their jobs until they find a replacement. Most people are hindered from following their dreams simply because there's no money in the venture. Take out the money and free everyone so that they can pursue their dreams. 

&gt;People have to be motivated. You work harder (and through your hard work make society better) to earn more money to live a better life. Why would someone work near as hard when they know all they have to do is show up and work half ass for 5 hours and they still get whatever they want. Which by the way, how will we have enough resources for this? If everyone can just swipe a card and get free stuff what's the limit to how much they can get? If there's no limit people will get whatever they want and over use our limited resources. 

In Sacred Economics, we will all work hard to build a wealthy society so that we can all enjoy it. Can you imagine the type of cooperation that would occur among people when everyone has the same exact goal in mind? People will consume as they go. Hoarding would be illegal. If anyoen is found to be reasonably hoarding, they would have to account for the mistake and fix it. Simple. If they are too stupid to understand why hoarding would kill the entire economy, we would have to send them to educational classes explaining the benefits of playing by the rules of society so that it works for all of us. There are always douchbags who are arrogant enough to thik they can somehow outsmart the system and get away with it but we, the people, will policie ourselves for the most part but if someone is really breaking the rules, we would have a court session. Punishment will no longer be used though.. only educational and emotional rehabilitation which actually works.

Of all the academics I studied under, this man impressed me the most with his intellect and teaching ability, and he taught that the whole global warming thing was simply part of a natural process, various reasons why CO2 couldn't be to blame, etc. We were examined on our understanding of that, too.

So, fast forward to recently and I was reflecting on that experience. I looked up the old prof to see what was up – surely, if he was still employed, he would have capitulated to the 'consensus' narrative. But, to my surprise, not only have his opinions remained intact, he's now dean of the Environmental Chemistry faculty (previously inorganic chemistry) and has authored a tome titled [Challenged Earth: An Overview of Humanity's Stewardship of Earth](http://booksplea.se/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=1508490&amp;google=AUD).

It was rather incongruous, so I went and searched to see what the environmentalists were saying about him, and they are basically invalidating his opinions by calling him a 'nuclear shill'. I.e., his belief is that nuclear is the way to go. That seems smart to me, especially in Australia where there aren't ever any earthquakes and there's plenty of geologically inert earth where nuclear waste could be stored safely.

[The Downside of the FCC’s New Internet Privacy Rules](http://hbr.org/2016/05/the-downside-of-the-fccs-new-internet-privacy-rules) 

&gt;To understand why the FCC’s involvement would create more problems than it would solve, it helps to understand a massive shift in web security over the last few years: the overwhelmingly successful campaign to encrypt data flowing to and from consumers over the Internet.

&gt;Encrypting data traffic ensures that information you send and receive can’t be decoded by anyone — including criminals, government snoops, and even the ISPs who provide your access to the internet. The latter group includes home and mobile broadband providers, and anyone — your cable provider or a coffee shop — who offers a Wi-Fi connection. Encryption means that only the sites you visit can see the contents of your interactions with them, which is how e-commerce companies, apps and other can provide customized suggestions, responses, directions, and advertisements.

&gt;According to Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology, disclosures of government hacking by former security contractor Edward Snowden greatly accelerated the push to encrypt everything.  Over half of all web traffic is now secured, as invisible to ISPs as it is to the NSA.  By the end of this year, that number will climb to 70%. Most email is already encrypted. Skype is encrypted, as are your interactions with Netflix and, increasingly, the videos you watch. In the next five to 10 years, encryption will become even more ubiquitous.

&gt;For mobile devices and the apps that run on them, the trend is increasingly to provide users with end-to-end encryption, meaning even the provider can’t reveal your data, with or without a court order...

And 

&gt;As a side-effect of the encryption campaign, ISPs are largely blind, for better and for worse, to consumer information of any kind, let alone what the FCC calls the “very sensitive and very personal” information that content and other on-line service providers have routinely used, so far to tremendous effect and minimal malevolence.

And then later he says: 

&gt;Yet to enforce consumer complaints that ISPs are violating the FCC’s proposed privacy rules, the agency will need expansive access to data traffic, not only of the complaining consumer but of other consumers. Providing technical back-doors for governments, however, is precisely the outcome Apple, WhatsApp, and other participants in the internet ecosystem are spending so much political capital to avoid. If history is any guide, it’s clear that once government agencies gain access to personal information, the likelihood of that data leaking elsewhere — the NSA, but also the IRS, the INS, and other regulators — is nearly 100%.

&gt;So why would rational consumers who value both their privacy and the effective customization of their online life want another regulatory “cop on the beat”— especially at a time when concerns over government information gathering are reshaping the technical architecture of the Web and mobile devices specifically to limit their access? It’s an issue that both consumers and businesses should be paying closer attention to.

22883,"Here's the problem with this Sirius-orbit idea...

Let me introduce you to Alpha Centauri. There are three main bodies in this star system: A, B, and C. (There may be others in a loose relationship but my point only depends on these three anyway.) Alpha Centauri A and B are quite close to each other, but C (also known as ""Proxima Centauri"") is 0.21 light years away from A/B, although it is known to orbit them.

Now, that's *one fifth* of a light year. How long do you think the orbital period is, for this distance? I'll tell you: [it's 550,000 years. Over half a *million* years!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri)

So at a distance of 0.21 light years, the period is half a million years. That's just physics. The greater the distance, the longer the period.

So there is absolutely zero chance that Sirius, which is *over 8 light years away* from our solar system, could be in an orbital motion with our sun at around a 24,000 year period. 

If anything is in gravitational orbit with our sun, with period around the same time as the precession of the equinoxes, it would need to be less than 0.02 light years away. Here's [Comet McNaught](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2006_P1), at *maximum* 0.0648 light-years away, and has an orbit of 92,000 years.

So people need to get off this Sirius idea. If there's a huge body in orbit with the sun on the scale of 25 thousand years' period, it's gotta be much closer than any star we currently know, and therefore a very dark body since we haven't seen it since telescopes were invented.

I am fascinated by the possibilities of ancient earthlings knowing more about the precession of the equinoxes than we currently give credit for, and if such knowledge can be found coded and handed down in an occulted manner, all the more breath-taking and jaw-dropping... But, still possible.

But Sirius being in orbit with the Sun? Not possible, and it tarnishes the veracity of any of these long-cycle ideas every time it gets brought up. ",conspiracy

Part of it is the idea that you get rid of a ton of separate welfare programs (tax deduction here, credit there, reduced bill for this and that, a cheque being mailed for this, a different one for that, etc) and just institute 1 simple program that gives everyone some simple-to-calculate sum of money to spend as they like.

Supposedly the simplified administrative burden would reduce costs, and the other benefit is that often people know what they need better than the government. IE maybe some people who qualify for food stamps but not for electricity assistance would be better off the other way around because they grow their own food but their electricity bill is absurd. UBI just gives them the money and lets them decide.

Of course that means some people will spend food-stamp money on drugs instead but the thinking is they might not if they had enough money to really feel like they can turn their life around and didn't feel discouraged.

Obviously the above is up for debate, but it's part of the justification for UBI, alongside the idea that automation will inevitably reduce the number of jobs available (which is also up for debate, so far automation has created new jobs while making some obsolete).

So if the point is to just reduce the administrative costs and to give money instead of food-stamps or bill reductions, then tying the way you get money back into taxes accomplishes those goals as long as we make the tax code behave like a UBI (ie you always get X amount of money back regardless of your income).",conspiracy

You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k

The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc

But what wasn't CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;feature=endscreen&amp;NR=1

The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their ""art"" - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!

http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207

Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:

https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report

Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.

They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That's why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn't sliced in half at all:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw

According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q

WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY

The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.

http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html

Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:

/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/

Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they're told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it's a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ

The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I

Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:

http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579

Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the ""art students"":

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html

Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, ""it's good for Israel"".

I'm not a member, but I do like to read it from time to time.

&gt;I'd be interested in hearing why you think they have so much trouble.

The main causes of their problem are the sexual revolution and the female mating strategy. Throughout history females have always had easier access to sex than males as seen by the fact that we have twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors. Females have always wanted to reproduce with men with high quality genes (i.e. attractive men). Before the sexual revolution this behavior were for the most part kept in check. Even a man with low quality genes could expect to find a woman to marry and have children with. After the sexual revolution this would no longer be the case as females would rather share the top 20% of men since this would give them access to high quality genes for their offspring. This implies that the other 80% of men will have less chance of having sex than they would before the sexual revolution and thus, you get a quite large percentage of men who are involuntarily celibate.

27215,"Your 'fact' does not take into account population growth since 1990. Moreover the quote from your article is clear:

&gt;Several such shootings took place also in 2016, but the overall rate of deadly violence in Sweden is still about 1 per 100,000 inhabitants...

Here are some official statistics. 

&gt;In absolute figures, an average of 80 persons per 
year were victims of lethal violence from 2010-2014, as compared with 95 
persons from 2000-2004 and an average of 107 persons from 1990-1994. 

https://i.imgur.com/FaVJx6g.png

Now the pertinent part:

&gt;Taken as a whole, lethal violence specifically with firearms has neither increased  nor  decreased  since  the  1990s.  There  was  an  average  of  slightly  fewer  than  20  victims  per  year  of  such  violence  in  the  beginning  of  the  1990s  as  well  as  in  the  beginning  of  the  2000s  and  the  beginning  of  the  2010s. There has, however, been a clear structural change in this lethal violence. In major metropolitan counties, there has been a continuous increase in  the  number  and  percentage  of  cases  which  occurred  in  the  context  of  
criminal conflicts where illegal handguns (pistols, revolvers) were used. At the same time, there has been a tangible decrease in the number and percentage of cases which take place in contexts other than criminal conflicts (for example, partner violence) outside of major metropolitan counties and with  legal  hunting  weapons  and  other  two-handed  weapons.  This  trend  means that criminal conflicts in major metropolitan counties came to represent  almost  half  of  all  cases  of  lethal  violence  with  firearms  in  Sweden  in the beginning of the 2010s, as compared with just under 20 per cent in the beginning of the 1990s, and that the number of men among all victims has increased while the number of women has decreased. The use of lethal 
firearm violence in the context of criminal conflicts has increased most in the counties of Skåne and Västra Götaland, while the level of such cases has more or less remain unchanged in Stockholm County when seen over the long-term. This difference means that Skåne and Västra Götaland are the only counties where lethal violence with firearms has increased overall in relation to population growth in the 1990s and 2000s.

https://i.imgur.com/XkJ5eJ5.png

Now, the most pertinent part:

&gt;One can see a high percentage of unemployed persons 
among the victims of other types of lethal violence as well, but the percent-
age  is  particularly  high  in  respect  of  victims  of  lethal  firearm  violence  in  
the  2000s.  A  considerably  high  percentage  of  lethal  firearm  violence  also  
took place in the most socially vulnerable areas of the major metropolitan 
counties (URBAN areas), where the residents’ socioeconomic resources are 
significantly less than those of the population on average. 

https://i.imgur.com/hWcrIqa.png

&gt;It  is  also  important  to  point  out  that  lethal  firearm  violence  which  takes  
place  in  the  context  of  criminal  conflicts  in  large  cities  still  constitutes  a  
limited  percentage  of  all  lethal  violence.  In  absolute  numbers,  such  cases  
increased from approximately 3 or 4 per year during the 1990s to approx-
imately 8 per year in the beginning of the 2010s. In other words, 9 out of 
10 cases of lethal violence in Sweden take place in other contexts.

&gt;37 percent of Democrats back Trump’s missile strikes. In 2013, 38 percent of Democrats supported Obama’s plan. That is well within the margin of error.

&gt; I really wanna go back to thinking earth is a globe

I would be careful of defining your beliefs in terms of labels such as that.  I don't think that you should want to believe anything other than what makes the most sense to you at the time. Right now, you're on the fence about what you believe because you don't know what makes the most sense.  What i'm trying to do is provide more data to you in favor of one side, so that you have more information to broaden your perspective.  In other words, we can only judge the validity of things based on our current scope of what we understand.  But when we get more information, suddenly that perspective increases, and things that made sense to you in the past, suddenly don't anymore, because you can see a bigger picture now, where before you couldn't.  To put it into another metaphor, your circle of understanding gets wider, thus illuminating things previously unseen.  Just believe what makes sense to you given the information you have at the time.

Now to address the airplane statements.

&gt; What bothers me is that pilots don't have to take the Coriolis effect

Basically the same thing for a bullet.  Extremely minuscule effects, which, given that an airplane is being piloted, the pilot compensates for.  In other words, ""We're being knocked 10ft right of our destination due to the Earth's rotation, well just turn the plane 10ft back on course capn!""  ezpz.

I mean, this is just one persons comment on an internet question board.  not really a beacon of immutable knowledge or anything.  Should probably gather a much larger database of opinions and information before throwing your weight behind a belief.

This is the thing about the coriolis effect.  Its extremely small.  Like very very subtle.  The reason its such a huge deal with long range shooting though, is because you have an extraordinarily small margin of error in making a long range shot.  So every tiny little calculation you can make to optimize your bullet's flight trajectory is a huge boon to you.  With flight of commercial airliners and bath, shower, and sink drain rotations, the Coriolis effect isn't really strong enough to illicit a reaction of any sort.  its just very insignificant.

I'm curious how they showed that *all chronic illnesses* have a breakdown of cellular structure while only studying mice? Nowhere in that article do they claim that they have discovered the mechanism of all chronic disease. 

You cited a seriously heavyweight paper and used to it support a statement that the authors themselves don't make. 

Not that there isn't a breakdown of cells, otherwise there isn't damage occuring at all, that's literally what damage is... cells breaking down. 

&gt;The energy released by electrons flowing through this electron transport chain is used to transport protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, in a process called electron transport. This generates potential energy in the form of a pH gradient and an electrical potential across this membrane. 

... yes. 

&gt;With the earlier definition provided one could say it's a receptor problem.

Are you just trying to say that cells let things in and out, when people are sick, bad things get into cells and kill them?

Things bind to receptors, this opens channels. Sometimes things bind to channels to close channels. Sometimes channels just don't give a fuck about receptors. There's such an absurd number and variety of receptors that saying 'it's a receptor problem' without specifying which receptors is about the same as shrugging and saying ""Eh, life right?"". *Of course receptors are involved*. Maybe I'm missing the point your trying to make here?

&gt;Oxidative phosphorylation (or OXPHOS in short) is the metabolic pathway in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing energy which is used to reform ATP. In most eukaryotes, this takes place inside mitochondria. Almost all aerobic organisms carry out oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway is probably so pervasive because it is a highly efficient way of releasing energy, compared to alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic glycolysis.

Yes. 

But that's not really the point I assume you're trying to get at. Oxidative pathways exist in cells (otherwise why breathe it in?) but problems only happen when you encounter oxidative stress: reactive oxygen species become to prevalent and (as it turns out) reactive oxygen is fucking toxic. Too much reactive oxygen and your DNA comes under attack, cells die etc. Sometimes damage mitachondria start generating reactive oxygen themselves, which just makes the problem worse. 

But that doesn't make it all bad. Your body both uses and protects against the effects of reactive oxygen, it's when those mechanisms are overwhelmed, malfunction or fail that you really run into problems (like neurodegenerative diseases).

SUNSPOT RESURRECTED: Old and decaying sunspot 1035, declared to be ""a corpse"" just yesterday, is showing signs of renewed life. Pete Lawrence sends this picture from his backyard observatory in Selsey, UK:
1/09/2010 http://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=09&amp;month=01&amp;year=2010 SOLAR ACTIVITY: Today has brought an uptick in solar activity. Sunspot 1040 (a.k.a. old sunspot 1035) is crackling with minor solar flares and seems to be gathering itself for something more. Just hours ago, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory captured this C1-class eruption:
￼
Backyard astronomers with solar telescopes are encouraged to monitor developments.
a movie: ""The plasma crawling around inside AR1040 made me think of the head of Medusa. It was exciting to watch!"" says amateur astronomer Michael Buxton of Ocean Beach, California. ""I made this time-lapse movie at 1 minute intervals from 2045-2215 UT on 8 Jan. 2010.""
￼
""A welcome view of the sun on a cold January day reveals the remains of AR11035 still alive and kicking,"" says Lawrence.
Beneath the waving filaments and bright magnetic froth (""plage""), a dark core is coelescing in the heart of the active region. That makes it a genuine sunspot again. NOAA has re-numbered the region ""1040,"" but we will continue to refer to it by its original name, ""1035."" It is, after all, an old friend.
1/10/2010 http://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=10&amp;month=01&amp;year=2010 BIG SUNSPOT: Sunspot 1040 (a.k.a. old sunspot 1035) is growing again and is now at least four times wider than planet Earth. A blink comparison of SOHO images shows how the sunspot has expanded in the past 24 hours:

Backyard astronomers with solar telescopes are encouraged to monitor developments.
1/11/2010 http://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=11&amp;month=01&amp;year=2010 BIG SUNSPOT: Sunspot 1040 is busy growing again. In only 24 hours, it has expanded from a barely visible ""sun-speck"" to a planet-sized active region with 15 dark cores and a tangled magnetic field. Steve Riegel sends this picture from his backyard observatory in Santa Maria, California:
￼
""On Sunday, the clouds opened up for some fantastic viewing,"" says Riegel. ""I photographed the active region using a Lunt 60 solar telescope.""
Sunspot 1040 is a member of new Solar Cycle 24. Its appearance continues a recent trend of intensifying solar activity. NOAA forecasters estimate a 10% chance of M- class solar flares during the next 24 hours. Stay tuned.
1/12/2012 http://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=12&amp;month=01&amp;year=2010
ACTIVE SUNSPOT: Sunspot 1040 is still growing. During the past two days it has doubled in size--and then doubled again--to produce an active region with more than 25 dark cores and a tangled magnetic field. Dennis Simmons sends this picture of the behemoth from Brisbane, Australia:
￼
""Sweltering under the Australian sun at over 31o C, I had to wipe the perspiration from my eyes while attempting to obtain sharp focus through Earth's shimmering atmosphere,"" says Simmons. ""It didn’t help that I had my head under a blanket to block out the bright sunlight that was washing out the display on my Notebook computer! In the end, technology and software allowed me to obtain some reasonable results. It is an impressive sunspot.""
Sunspot 1040 is a member of new Solar Cycle 24, and its appearance continues a recent trend of intensifying solar activity. NOAA forecasters say there is a 15% chance of an isolated M-class solar flare during the next 24 hours. Readers with solar telescopes should be alert for eruptions.
Solar winds began at a low 291km/s on the 08th. From beginning minima calm. New sunspot introduced to lens emitting gamma / beta M class activity. Most active the 09th. Average time to eartg 1-3 days.
Could likely have lead to a sizeable quake. (imo). Wind speeds doubled by the 11th. At 490km/s.
Unaware of coronal holes via solarham archive. Although this ch was spotted on the 01st of January 2010
Which was likely geoactive on the 10th. Being the sunspot was behind the CH. Which likely lead to increased geo magnetic storm levels. Prior to the forthcoming Sunspot.
So both coronal holes and sunspots were geo active on tge lens. My guess is this was at the very beginning of cycle 24. Post minima. Which increased the general threat from solar upticks.

To end slavery was a fight in itself and if it wasn't the south who tf were they fighting? Who was holding blacks back from being treated as PEOPLE as they were and are?

Think about it, the people telling you this are sample people making millions selling the more expensive ""non-fat"" or ""low-fat"" foods which are just as bad if not worse for you than the original. The truth of the matter that fat is a crucial part of our diet, especially from healthy sources such as nuts, fish, healthy oils like olive or coconut (corn and vegetable oil/pam are owned by the same people who sell the ""non-fat"" foods).

Eating a moderate to high amounts of fat is not unhealthy and does not lead to obesity as we are led to believe through the subliminal advertisements. Don't believe me, try and find one example of someone who changed from ""full-fat"" to ""non-fat"" or ""reduced-fat"" foods and left everything else constant that saw ANY health improvements.

A good amount of fats from food are necessary for us to survive. It's the high sodium, high sugar, high simple carbohydrates especially high fructose corn syrup and other sweeteners that have really led to the health problems in America vs other countries, not excess fat in diets.

&gt; In conversations with members of his circle and with others he tried to recruit to help him, the GOP operative, Peter W. Smith, implied he was working with retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, at the time a senior adviser to then-candidate Donald Trump.

&gt; “He said, ‘I’m talking to Michael Flynn about this—if you find anything, can you let me know?’” said Eric York, a computer-security expert from Atlanta who searched hacker forums on Mr. Smith’s behalf for people who might have access to the emails.

&gt; In another recruiting email seen by the Journal, Jonathan Safron, a law student Mr. Smith described as a close colleague, included links to the websites and LinkedIn profiles of people purportedly working with the Smith team. At the top of the list was the name and website of Flynn Intel, which Mr. Flynn set up.

&gt; In phone conversations, Mr. Smith told a computer expert he was in direct contact with Mr. Flynn and his son, according to this expert. 

Here is some more background. Peter W. Smith was involved in the Heritage Foundation, the RNC, and GOPAC. Flynn and his son, before the election were  trying to get hacked materials on a political opponent from Russia. Flynn and Jr. are known to have promoted [actual fake news on their twitter accounts,](http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/14/politics/kfile-flynn-deleted-tweets/index.html) along [with Trump](http://www.newsweek.com/vladimir-putin-sidney-blumenthal-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-benghazi-sputnik-508635).

Mike Flynn and Jr. deleted their twitter accounts shortly after being interviewed by the FBI. According the story :

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3364648/ This article explores the issues and concludes that sensory dysfunction and systemic failure, manifested as autism, is the inevitable consequence arising from subtle DNA alteration and consequently from the overuse of vaccines.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3878266/ In phase I, it was observed that there was a significantly increased risk ratio for the incidence of ASD reported following the Thimerosal-containing DTaP vaccine in comparison to the Thimerosal-free DTaP vaccine. In phase II, it was observed that cases diagnosed with an ASD were significantly more likely than controls to receive increased organic-Hg from Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine administered within the first, second, and sixth month of life.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21623535 A positive and statistically significant relationship was found: The higher the proportion of children receiving recommended vaccinations, the higher was the prevalence of AUT or SLI. 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25377033 The risk of autism among African American children vaccinated before the age of 2 years was 340% that of those vaccinated later.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24995277 The purpose of this review is to examine these six publications and analyze possible reasons why their published outcomes are so different from the results of investigations by multiple independent research groups over the past 75+ years.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12145534 Because many autistic children harbor elevated levels of measles antibodies, we conducted a serological study of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and MBP autoantibodies. 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21058170 Boys vaccinated as neonates had threefold greater odds for autism diagnosis compared to boys never vaccinated or vaccinated after the first month of life. 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22099159 The increase in exposure to Al adjuvants significantly correlates with the increase in ASD prevalence in the United States observed over the last two decades; and a significant correlation exists between the amounts of Al administered to preschool children and the current prevalence of ASD in seven Western countries, particularly at 3-4 months of age. The application of the Hill's criteria to these data indicates that the correlation between Al in vaccines and ASD may be causal.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17454560 Between 12 and 24 mo of age, these previously normally developing children suffered mercury toxic encephalopathies that manifested with clinical symptoms consistent with regressive ASDs. Evidence for mercury intoxication should be considered in the differential diagnosis as contributing to some regressive ASDs.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19106436 The overwhelming preponderance of the evidence favours acceptance that Hg exposure is capable of causing some ASDs.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3774468/ The purpose of the present critical review is provide mechanistic insight regarding how limited thiol availability, abnormal sulfation chemistry, and decreased GSH reserve capacity in children with an ASD could make them more susceptible to the toxic effects of TM routinely administered as part of mandated childhood immunization schedules.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3697751/ This suggests certain individuals with a mild mitochondrial defect may be highly susceptible to mitochondrial specific toxins like the vaccine preservative thimerosal.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21299355 Therefore, autism is the result of genetic defects and/or inflammation of the brain. The inflammation could be caused by a defective placenta, immature blood-brain barrier, the immune response of the mother to infection while pregnant, a premature birth, encephalitis in the child after birth, or a toxic environment.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21907498 Conjugate vaccines and autism.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11339848 A review of medical literature and US government data suggests that: (i) many cases of idiopathic autism are induced by early mercury exposure from thimerosal; (ii) this type of autism represents an unrecognized mercurial syndrome; and (iii) genetic and non-genetic factors establish a predisposition whereby thimerosal's adverse effects occur only in some children.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17674242 Children with ASDs were significantly more likely to have Rh-negative mothers than controls. Each ASD patient's mother was determined to have been administered a TCR during her pregnancy. The results provide insights into the potential role prenatal mercury exposure may play in some children with ASDs.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21993250 Conjugate vaccines may predispose children to autism spectrum disorders (explanation of a hypothesis) 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15780490 The potential importance of steroids in the treatment of autistic spectrum disorders and other disorders involving mercury toxicity.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12933322 Hair mercury levels in the autistic group were 0.47 ppm versus 3.63 ppm in controls, a significant difference. The mothers in the autistic group had significantly higher levels of mercury exposure through Rho D immunoglobulin injections and amalgam fillings than control mothers. Within the autistic group, hair mercury levels varied significantly across mildly, moderately, and severely autistic children, with mean group levels of 0.79, 0.46, and 0.21 ppm, respectively.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16870260 Cultured lymphocytes from autistic children and non-autistic siblings up-regulate heat shock protein RNA in response to thimerosal challenge.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19043938 A careful review of ASD cases discloses a number of events that adhere to an immunoexcitotoxic mechanism. This mechanism explains the link between excessive vaccination, use of aluminum and ethylmercury as vaccine adjuvants, food allergies, gut dysbiosis, and abnormal formation of the developing brain.

39020,"&gt;For example, with the holographic equation (eqn 24) - if we plug in the CODATA rest mass of the proton we yield a radius, that radius was confirmed within one sigma of our measured value at the latest accelerator experiments.

So what I'm seeing here is that he multiplies the surface area of the sphere, and multiplies it by the planck mass. Which seems strange, because mass is generally connected to volume, not area. I assume this part of his whole holographic idea, but he doesn't justify why this is done. 

Then he just straight out divides the PSUs out of the protons area, despite these PSUs supposedly being spheres. That's odd, because if you'd try to combine those spheres, then because of gaps between the spheres, you won't ever get the exact same volume as the proton. Unless these areas are weirdly shaped, but their volume is based on a sphere.. soo.. that's strange. I don't see a justification for this either. 

Then he divides the surface mass over the area? Why?  And he adds a random factor 2, which I don't see any justification for either.  

In the end he gets a number that is sort of close to the measured value, but it isn't within experimental bounds, and the method and lack of justification for any of this still makes me think he's just cherry picking random variables again. Like, why a proton? There's tons of other particles, why not work with them? By just selecting whatever particle you want, picking some variables that sound like they might be kind of related but aren't really, and by then introducing random factors (that 2), you could make basically any number you want. 

It doesn't really feel like it's the logical/causal model you claim it to be, unless there's a huge chunk of explanation that I'm missing (and which would've been great to have in the paper)

I'm not really seeing the dark energy fix in the pdf you linked either, would you mind elaborating? It seems that at the end he just divides the mass of the universe by its size, which yeah is kind of the way you get the density of the universe. Technically he uses his proton based mass thing, but that still feels like it's a rather arbitrarily picked value. In the end he gets a density that is way below what is necessary (the lower bound is seemingly at least 5 *10^-30, with most indicating something closer to 10^-29), that difference is the entire point of requiring dark energy.",conspiracy

42108,"Thank you. I stumbled across this theory last night, and thought I'd offer some explanation.

These so called ""accounts"" aren't real. That's why you're hearing non-stop about these transactions getting reversed. The reason that they appear to go through in the first place is that these people are attempting transactions with valid routing numbers for Federal Reserve and US Treasury banks.

Normally, when making a payment online with a checking account, the routing and account numbers are verified, and the transaction is sent to the bank. The Federal Reserve's routing numbers, however, are not consumer banks. I do not think that the account numbers are verified in the same way. The routing number is valid, and the transaction is sent to be processed.

When it hits the Fed's bank account, there are a few possibilities:

There is no such account number, so the transaction is reversed.

There is an account with that number, but because of name and address are incorrect it is declined and reversed.

There is an account with that number, it goes through. You've now committed interstate wire fraud.

In response to this, many websites and services have either started properly verifying the accounts, or are just completely blocking routing numbers from non-consumer government banks.

Anyone who has a solid understanding of ACH payment processing would see this immediately. These people offer absolutely no tangible evidence that there are actual accounts that are in their name, at least not that I've seen.

What really makes me sick is that there are people out there, who say they will help you access these alleged accounts for a fee. They're charging people money, and essentially stealing their personal information and using it for their personal gain. Absolutely disgusting.

I had never even thought about the possibility of this being use by our governments to identify people who hold certain beliefs. But you're right. You're literally handing your full name and SSN to a Federal Reserve bank and telling them that you've fallen for this BS propaganda.

Subsequently, those companies made a lot of money of those shares for which they did not pay taxes in Russia or the States.  In early 2008 HSBC and Hermatige were accused of committing fraud against the Russian treasury.  This was before Magnitsky events.   Browder's office was raided because of these investigations... concerning the fraud that occurred against the Russian treasury. 

Magnitsky was not a lawyer.  Magnitsky was an accountant. He did not turn any documents concerning corruption, he was investigated after being named as a co-conspirator by one of the people that were found guilty of defrauding the Russian treasury.  That is why the offices got raided, and that is why Magnitsky was interrogated twice.

&gt;ANTI-SEMITISM is defined as the spreading of enmity against the Jews. When the damnable Tsarist monarchy was living out its last hours, it attempted to divert the illiterate workers and peasants into pogroms against the Jews.

&gt;The Tsar’s police in union with the landlords and capitalists organised Jewish pogroms. They attempted to divert the natural hatred of the workers and peasants for the exploiters against the Jews.

&gt;Even in other countries one often experiences that the capitalists stir up enmity against the Jews, in order to divert the attention of the workers from the real enemy of the working masses, capital.

&gt;**Enmity against the Jews can only exist where the landowners and capitalists have kept the workers and peasants in complete illiteracy through bondage.**

&gt;Only entirely uneducated and completely oppressed people can believe the lies and slanders which are being spread about the Jews. These are survivals from the times of serfdom, when the priests burnt heretics at the stake, when peasants were trampled upon and were blind. But these dark survivals of serfdom are disappearing, the people are beginning to see.

&gt;It is not the Jews who are the enemies of the toilers. **The enemies of the workers are the capitalists of all lands.** Among the Jews there are workers, toilers, they are in the majority. They are our brothers, comrades in the struggle for Socialism, because they are oppressed by capitalism. Among the Jews there are Kulaks, exploiters, capitalists, **just like amongst us all.**

&gt;**The capitalists are tireless in their endeavours to stir up enmity between the workers of different faiths, different nations and different races. The rich Jews, just like the rich Russians and the rich of all countries, are united in trampling upon, oppressing and dividing the workers.**

&gt;Disgrace and infamy to the damnable Tsarism which tortured and persecuted the Jews! Disgrace and infamy to whoever sows enmity against Jews and hatred against other nations! Long live brotherly faith and unity in struggle of all nations, for the overthrow of capitalism!

*- Vladimir Lenin, from a gramophone record made during the Civil War, in 1919.* 

&gt;There remains that universal historical tendency of capitalism to smash down national barriers, to erase national differences, to assimilate nations, which with each decade shows itself more powerfully, and which constitutes one of the greatest motive forces transforming capitalism into socialism.

&gt;He who does not acknowledge and defend the equality of nations and languages, he who does not fight against all forms of national oppression or inequality, is not a Marxist nor even a democrat. That is certain. But it is just as certain that he who pretends to be a Marxist, but violently attacks the Marxist of another nation or “assimilation” in practice, is just a petty bourgeois nationalist. . . .

&gt;The people who are shouting most against the “assimilationism” of the Russian orthodox Marxists4 are the Jewish nationalists in Russia, and in particular the Bundists. Yet, as can be seen from previously quoted figures, out of 10½ million Jews in the world about half live in the civilized world, in conditions of the greatest “assimilation,” while only the unfortunate, downtrodden, outlaw Jews of Russia and Galicia (crushed by the Purishkeviches, Russian and Polish), live in conditions of the least “assimilation,” the greatest segregation, including “Pales,” “percentage standards,” and other reactionary delights.

&gt;The Jews in the civilised world are not a nation, they have become most of all assimilated, affirm Karl Kautsky and Otto Bauer. The Jews in Galicia and Russia are not a nation, they unfortunately (and not through their fault, but owing to the Purishkeviches) are still a caste. This is the unquestioned conclusion of people who are unquestionably well informed in the history of the Jews.

&gt;What do these facts indicate? They indicate that “assimilation” can be denounced only by the Jewish reactionary petty bourgeois, who wish to turn back the wheel of history, and to force it to move, not from the conditions of Russia and Galicia to the conditions of Paris and New York, but in the opposite direction. . . .

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Peruzzi

Mario Peruzzi (September 8, 1875 – December 10, 1955) was an Italian-born American businessman and manufacturer. He was the co-founder and president of the Planters Peanut Company.

Peruzzi was a director of the Miners National Bank of Wilkes-Barre for twenty years prior to his resignation from the board in 1949. Peruzzi was also president of Planters Edible Oil Company and National Peanut Corporation during this time. He was also on the board of Mercy Hospital in Wilkes-Barre for a few years. He was also associated with the Wilkes-Barre-Wyoming Valley Chamber of Commerce, the Italo-American Citizens club and various local Rotary clubs.[2]

Peruzzi became president of Planters Nut and Chocolate Company upon the death of Obici in 1947. At this time the company had 2,000 employees and sold $40,000,000 worth a year. The company grew to over 3,000 employees in the 1950s. Peruzzi continued to be its president until his death on December 10, 1955.[2]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peruzzi

The Peruzzi were bankers of Florence, among the leading families of the city in the 14th century, before the rise to prominence of the Medici. Their modest antecedents stretched back to the mid 11th century, according to the family's genealogist Luigi Passerini, but a restructuring of the Peruzzii company in 1300, with an infusion of outside capital, marked the start of a quarter-century of prosperity that brought the family consortium to the forefront of Florentine affairs.

The size of the bank should not be understated: by the 1330s, the Peruzzi bank was the second largest in Europe, with fifteen branches from the Middle East to London, all capitalized to the sum of more than 100,000 gold florins and manned by approximately 100 factors.[1]",conspiracy

They love to eat children, but not adults as adults are contaminated with drugs, nicotine, alcohol, and other substances. They can hide their appearance using technology that essentially creates a hologram around them, but sometimes, in the right circumstances, a digital camera can see right through the hologram disguise. Most missing children end up going to the reptilians for dinner.
2. The Illuminati get their instructions from the Reptilians. The I's are huge businessman, very rich, and have several of their own secret societies that control things. The I's rarely see the reptilians, but there are cases of sightings. Usually the Reptilians send a low-level reptilian servant in robes. 

All the rest has to do with various societies controlled by the Illuminati, playing politics on a global scale, and working towards a new world order. Their current plan includes making some type of major catastrophe. The fake global warming was one plan to alarm people to spend time and money on something useless.

Part of this plan is a world catastrophe happens, and aliens come down to ""save us"". But these aliens are not the good guys, as the good guys have a policy of non-interference. The aliens are bad guys who will slowly take away liberties until there are no rights, and no guns, left. The bad aliens will likely have someone who looks like Jesus. The bad aliens will claim they made Jesus (which is false) and might show a film of him being crucified (which is true, they were there).

What do you say to Russian historian Boris Borisov, who studied census records and noticed that 7 million Americans mysteriously vanished during the famine of 1932-33 (larger even than the death toll experienced in the Ukraine at the same time period, which was imposed by Stalin).

See his article *The American Famine*.

* Footnote: This is no dig against you (because I didn't know about this tragedy either until recently). But I'm always blown away how American children are taught about the suffering of Jews in another continent and taken on field trips to the Holocaust Museum . . . but are utterly unaware of even larger death-tolls in their own country (suppressed by their own government). I can understand their ignorance that Mao and Stalin actually murdered far more people than Hitler (because those happened in distant lands, with no real lobby groups in America to popularize and humanize the victims). I can see how they have no idea about the Armenian genocide or what horrors in Cambodia. But to not know your *own* history? Simply staggering. It's like all those deaths had no value, no meaning. In school today, kids are taught about Anne Frank. But if someone even brought up the deaths of poor Oakies in the US at this time-period (dying in larger numbers), they'd be shouted down and told to ""Check their privilege. Oakies don't count as a victim-group. They're white. They don't matter"". There is no ""Diary of a Young Oakie Girl"" that kids are taught in schools. But plenty of globalist propaganda books to encourage kids to ignore their own history and identify, rather, with European Jews, Syrian refugee children, Hindu social justice activist teenagers like Malala, etc. See an example here: http://ew.com/books/2017/04/12/bana-alabed-memoir/ I leave you with a quote from Orwell: ""The most effective way to destroy a people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history.”",conspiracy

""A start-up is offering people over 35 the chance to get teenage blood for $8,000 to fight aging

It might sound like science fiction, or a recent episode of ""Silicon Valley,"" but a start-up called Ambrosia is charging $8,000 for blood transfusions from young people.

About 100 people have signed up to receive an infusion, founder Dr. Jesse Karmazin said Wednesday at the Code Conference.

Anyone over age 35 can become an Ambrosia customer, said Karmazin, but most of the early adopters tend to be of retirement age. He also stressed that it's a range of people, and not just Bay Area technologists, who have signed up.

The donated blood typically comes from teenagers, although anyone under age 25 is eligible. The company buys its supply from blood banks, which also sell blood to pharmaceutical companies. So high-schoolers donating their blood are not aware that it might be used on healthy adults.

Speaking to a roomful of technologists, Karmazin explained that the company does not claim that it can cure aging. Instead, he's hoping to recruit hundreds more people to research whether the transfusions can help fight particular symptoms associated with aging. Traditionally, biological aging hasn't been treated as a disease, which makes it challenging to study.

Karmazin said those who have signed up have seen some positive benefits and haven't reported any negative ones. Blood transfusions come with a variety of risks, including allergic reactions.""

54520,"&gt; The fact is that there was admittedly some actual freefall that occurred, and the rest of the building fell at near free fall speed.

Logically, that is untrue. The building *overall* took 40% longer to collapse than a true free-fall. That is not ""near"" to free-fall at all, especially when you consider that a large portion of that time it was free-falling, so therefore the time when it wasn't must have been significantly slower than 40%.

The explanation - that the initial collapse occurred in the lower section and started 'slowly', and then the upper section collapsed without resistance into the empty space left behind after Stage 1 - is plausible. 

That debris from the Twin Towers set it aflame in multiple places is plausible.

That the fire went unchecked because emergency services were already overwhelmed and water supply cut-off is plausible.

That the outer frame of the building collapsed 'symmetrically' because the inside support widely failed first (because of unchecked fires) leaving it as a relatively stronger shell which collapsed suddenly and totally is plausible, to me.

All these things are more plausible than lasers, or nukes, or somehow rigging the building for a demolition with nobody noticing. Scientifically, logically.

&gt; Out of curiosity, where does your resistance to this theory come from?

I appraise each theory on its own merits, and place more weight on those which are strongest logically. Given the vast amount of mutually exclusive 'truths' flying around out there IMO the 'official' story simply ticks more boxes than any of the others, and requires less leaps of faith for validity. 

I certainly don't assume the US gov is innocent in all things, my flavour of conspiracies just trends toward the more mundane, something like Iran/Contra or CIA drug smuggling (I dabble in JFK conspiracies too), or wars based on blatant deceptions by TPTB.

I just need a good reason to think something is so; sometimes there is, and sometimes there isn't. Most Truthers start at 'inside job' and work backwards from there (and boy does it get whacky sometimes). That's not rational thinking, it's fantasizing.

Well, that was a difficult thing for me to accept in the beginning. See I know the purpose of our Universe. I don't know the plan for all universes. I know what the basic plan is, but not every detail. The creator apparently has discovered many interesting things outside of our universe that apparently could help our universe in some way. I didn't ask much about the other universes to be honest because I was sad. Why doesn't and why hasn't the creator contacted any humans like it used to do back in the day? Because it burnt the fuck out on us for a while. Seriously bummed the shit outta me. Literally our ancestors drove the creator entity to such frustration that it left. So that's about as deep as I got regarding the bigger picture. At that point I may have actually been crying. So I turned my questions back to our Universe in particular.

""You say the creator is a one of a kind and is trying to understand what they are ""and much more"". What if the ""much more"" was that the creator is trying to recreate the circumstances of it's own creation?""

You know what. Before I answer that question I would just like to say one thing. Whoever you are I like you. Because you are apparently smarter than me. That is exactly what it was trying to do with our universe. At this point though so no one else gets sad like I did, yes the entity has returned its attention back to this universe. 

""Not just trying to understand itself, I mean the goal was to figure out how to make another like itself. It would be lonely being the only one of your kind, wouldn't it?""

That is precisely what it tried in the beginning. It said the first thing that drove it to creating other entities was out of loneliness. It has only snowballed from there. To the point it is trying to figure out what/how/why/for what purpose was it created? If that entity created all that we know...wouldn't you want to attempt to figure out what created the creator? I do. Though a hilarious thought I had the other day. What if it is creators all the way down just trying to figure shit out in their own universe created by another.

(a) As used in this section:
(1) The term ''utility'' means any person who is a local exchange carrier or
an electric, gas, water, steam, or other public utility, and who owns or controls
poles, ducts, conduits, or rights-of-way used, in whole or in part, for any wire
communications. Such term does not include any railroad, any person who is
cooperatively organized, or any person owned by the Federal Government or any
State.
(2) The term ''Federal Government'' means the Government of the United
States or any agency or instrumentality thereof.
(3) The term ''State'' means any State, territory, or possession of the United
States, the District of Columbia, or any political subdivision, agency, or
instrumentality thereof.
(4) The term ''pole attachment'' means any attachment by a cable television
system or provider of telecommunications service to a pole, duct, conduit, or
right-of-way owned or controlled by a utility.
(5) For purposes of this section, the term ''telecommunications
carrier'' (as defined in section 3 of this Act) does not include any incumbent
local exchange carrier as defined in section 251(h).
(b)(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, the
Commission shall regulate the rates, terms, and conditions for pole attachments to
provide that such rates, terms, and conditions are just and reasonable, and shall
adopt procedures necessary and appropriate to hear and resolve complaints
concerning such rates, terms, and conditions. For purposes of enforcing any
determinations resulting from complaint procedures established pursuant to this
subsection, the Commission shall take such action as it deems appropriate and
necessary, including issuing cease and desist orders, as authorized by section
312(b) of title III of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
(2) The Commission shall prescribe by rule regulations to carry out the
provisions of this section.
(c)(1) Nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to, or to give the
Commission jurisdiction with respect to rates, terms, and conditions, or access to
poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way as provided in subsection (f), for pole
attachments in any case where such matters are regulated by a State.
(2) Each State which regulates the rates, terms, and conditions for pole
attachments shall certify to the Commission that--
Communications Act of 1934
60
(A) it regulates such rates, terms, and conditions; and
(B) in so regulating such rates, terms, and conditions, the State has
the authority to consider and does consider the interests of the subscribers
of the services offered via such attachments, as well as the interests of the
consumers of the utility services.
(3) For purposes of this subsection, a State shall not be considered to
regulate the rates, terms, and conditions for pole attachments--
(A) unless the State has issued and made effective rules and
regulations implementing the State's regulatory authority over pole
attachments; and
(B) with respect to any individual matter, unless the State takes
final action on a complaint regarding such matter--
(i) within 180 days after the complaint is filed with the
State, or
(ii) within the applicable period prescribed for such final
action in such rules and regulations of the State, if the prescribed
period does not extend beyond 360 days after the filing of such
complaint.
(d)(1) For purposes of subsection (b) of this section, a rate is just and
reasonable if it assures a utility the recovery of not less than the additional costs of
providing pole attachments, nor more than an amount determined by multiplying
the percentage of the total usable space, or the percentage of the total duct or
conduit capacity, which is occupied by the pole attachment by the sum of the
operating expenses and actual capital costs of the utility attributable to the entire
pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way.
(2) As used in this subsection, the term ''usable space'' means the space
above the minimum grade level which can be used for the attachment of wires,
cables, and associated equipment.
(3) This subsection shall apply to the rate for any pole attachment used by a
cable television system solely to provide cable service. Until the effective date of
the regulations required under subsection (e), this subsection shall also apply to the
rate for any pole attachment used by a cable system or any telecommunications
carrier (to the extent such carrier is not a party to a pole attachment agreement) to
provide any telecommunications service. 
(e)(1) The Commission shall, no later than 2 years after the date of
enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, prescribe regulations in
accordance with this subsection to govern the charges for pole attachments used
by telecommunications carriers to provide telecommunications services, when the
parties fail to resolve a dispute over such charges. Such regulations shall ensure
that a utility charges just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory rates for pole
attachments. 
(2) A utility shall apportion the cost of providing space on a pole, duct,
Communications Act of 1934
61
conduit, or right-of-way other than the usable space among entities so that such
apportionment equals two-thirds of the costs of providing space other than the
usable space that would be allocated to such entity under an equal apportionment
of such costs among all attaching entities.
(3) A utility shall apportion the cost of providing usable space among all
entities according to the percentage of usable space required for each entity. 
(4) The regulations required under paragraph (1) shall become effective 5
years after the date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Any
increase in the rates for pole attachments that result from the adoption of the
regulations required by this subsection shall be phased in equal annual increments
over a period of 5 years beginning on the effective date of such regulations. 
(f)(1) A utility shall provide a cable television system or any
telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to any pole, duct,
conduit, or right-of-way owned or controlled by it.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a utility providing electric service may
deny a cable television system or any telecommunications carrier access to its
poles, ducts, conduits, or rights-of-way, on a non-discriminatory basis where there
is insufficient capacity and for reasons of safety, reliability and generally applicable
engineering purposes.
(g) A utility that engages in the provision of telecommunications services
or cable services shall impute to its costs of providing such services (and charge
any affiliate, subsidiary, or associate company engaged in the provision of such
services) an equal amount to the pole attachment rate for which such company
would be liable under this section.
(h) Whenever the owner of a pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way intends to
modify or alter such pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way, the owner shall provide
written notification of such action to any entity that has obtained an attachment to
such conduit or right-of-way so that such entity may have a reasonable opportunity
to add to or modify its existing attachment. Any entity that adds to or modifies its
existing attachment after receiving such notification shall bear a proportionate
share of the costs incurred by the owner in making such pole, duct, conduit, or
right-of-way accessible.
(i) An entity that obtains an attachment to a pole, conduit, or right-of-way
shall not be required to bear any of the costs of rearranging or replacing its
attachment, if such rearrangement or replacement is required as a result of an
additional attachment or the modification of an existing attachment sought by any
other entity (including the owner of such pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way).""",conspiracy

in fact, I bet if YOU were on the top, it would be drugs and bisexual orgies for you lol. I feel like the power elite have more In common with transsexuals than anything else.

the internal power hierarchy has different rules than society does at the bottom. its inconceivable for us to know what its like to have the power to have whatever we want in an instant.

a true Marxist does not support Nazi or stalin-esque control of media and knowledge, and centralized control of 'the party'

what many of these radical feminists do is directly opposed to communist OR anarchist ideals.

instead of removing the hierarchy and power structure, they become bent on 'fixing' it like so many other good capitalists, but also bent on emotional and personal desires.

even just changing social relations to only be in the interest of one gender because it 'feels' better.|

57255,"&gt;  In 2016, Micah Zenko and Amelia Mae Wolf of the Council on Foreign Relations reported that “The Obama administration’s assumption that drones cause less collateral damage than piloted aircraft is simply untrue. According to the best publicly available evidence, drone strikes in non-battlefield settings — Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia — **result in 35 times more civilian fatalities** than airstrikes by manned weapons systems in conventional battlefields, such as Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan.”

...

&gt;But the United States found a solution to the problem of “collateral damage.” The Obama administration defined the problem out of existence by **assuming that any male of military age in a war zone is a militant and worthy of execution** in a “signature” strike. In most of these strikes, the U.S. has no way of knowing whether those targeted were terrorists.

Top logic. How do they identify the age of possible militants I wonder?


&gt;Per international humanitarian law, drones can only be used with bombs in an active armed conflict and even then with certain restrictions including military necessity, humanity, distinction, and proportionality. Only combatants or civilians who are directly participating in hostilities may be targeted. **Targeting of other civilians is prohibited and may constitute a war crime.** How much the US government is respecting these principles, Lisa, using drones both as surveillance and bombs?

I'm sure the U.S. military would never suppress any footage of possible war crimes! Never!


&gt; Trump, on the other hand, has given carte blanche to his generals. **He says he “trusts” his generals to make military decisions and leaves it up to them. As a result, the number of drone strikes has actually risen dramatically since Trump took office.**

&gt;**As a result, the number of civilian deaths has skyrocketed.** Whereas Obama had sharply limited CIA involvement in drone warfare, Trump has expanded the CIA’s role.

58166,"In that case, I'm glad to hear you're interested in learning a little more.

I've got good news and bad news.

**The good news** is that if you go to your local university library, and do some reading on international law, international relations, and global governance you'll get a clearer and clearer idea about how the international system works (or more to the point doesn't work).

States are the primary actors, and the rich ones have the most power.

The UN is an experiment in bringing States together to try to create multilateral solutions to global problems. No one State can solve world hunger, human rights abuses, or climate change. The only way to do that is to work together to find common solutions. There is some corruption in the UN and plenty of horse trading over important issues (vote buying and strong arm negotiations). That said, it is mostly staffed by people who want to make the world a better place and try to make decisions not based on national self interest but with consideration for all of the people of the world (this is why many american conservatives think the UN is communist).

The problem is that the UN and most of its international organizations are quite weak by themselves and have limited power beyond facilitating interactions between States.

The exception to this trend in international organizations are the Bretton Woods/Washington Consensus organizations: The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.

The WTO is powerful because trade is important. That and it has been structured to have a binding dispute settlement mechanism (a rarity in the international system).

The WB is described as a bank but really what it is is a development fund. The reason people dislike the WB so much is that in the 1980's it started adding condition to loans. The conditions demand structural changes to how the recipient country runs it's government. They started to require privatization of public companies, reductions of social services, debt reductions, the movement of the economy to an export focus (often cash crops like coffee or soybeans). The end result is the WB has successfully created a rich/upper middle class in the developing world and hasn't done too much for the poorest of the poor. There is some trickle down but not much.

The IMF is more of a bank than a fund. It is considered a lender of last resort. Which means that when a country can no longer borrow from private banks to keep the country afloat (Greece) the IMF steps in and lends them money. The loans they give are very short term (1-2 years) (whereas the WB does 10-15 year loans) but because of the shortness of the term, they demand even stricter structural adjustment policies than the WB. Their goal is to dramatically turn countries around in a short period of time. The results are often harshest for the poor. Read the Shock Doctrine and complaints by Joseph Stiglitz about how this process does more harm than good. 

Keep in mind however, the countries in question approach the IMF and the WB, not the other way around. Even with a mixed track record they're goal is not to make the world a worse place but to try to bring a chaotic world back from the brink. The IMF and the WB are powerful because they have lots of money to throw around.

None of these organizations are powerful without the support of the great powers (the US, the UK, France, Germany, Russia, China, Japan) who fund and thus control them. This gives you an indication of the power of States over international organizations, particularly the power of the US to make or break the UN.

There is far more to learn but I've got you started. Dig through some textbooks (it's the best way to learn). I've spend years at this, my first degree was in political science, then I got a law degree, and I'm currently doing a master's degree in IR. All I can tell you is there are no real shortcuts to understanding the international legal system.

Now **the bad news**.

If you go to youtube, and search for NWO you will learn that the Jews (the Rothchild's) are trying to create a tyrannical world government and their primary tool of enslavement is the IMF. 

It's a simple narrative with a clear villain: The Jewish Bankers.

If you want to take the shortcut to understanding the world, follow contheory_spiracist down the youtube rabbit hole. It will give you clear answers to complicated problems. What it won't do is explain how to fix those problems other than 'hate Jews'.

**In closing**, you have rightly surmised that I don't give a lot of evidence to support my arguments (I don't back up my points with scholarly articles, web links or youtube clips). I don't do this mainly because the conspiracy true believers won't be swayed by it. So why should I bother? What I do is ask them to defend their arguments and generally all they can do is provide links to youtube videos with scary music or conspiracy websites like Alex Jones. In effect I mock them for being sold a bunch of propaganda the exact same way they mock the general public for being brainwashed by the mainstream media. I realize it's petty, but I just hate closed minded racists.


There are no shortcuts to knowledge but I'll give you a bibliography to get you started. Good luck in your search for truth.

And most patients aren't getting treatment for that long. They have it for a few weeks or couple months then have to pause because it damages the body too much. A lot of the time, patients either beat the cancer or die within a few years. Sometimes it comes back, but not always. 

I don't think this idea that treatment is some long term way of milking patients holds up to the reality of cancer treatments. I would wager their is way more money in a cure, and whoever finds it first makes themselves and their entire family line rich indefinitely. Furthermore, the theory always assumes a cure would be some one time pill, but very few illnesses are cured that way. Usually cures themselves are lengthy processes and procedures you can charge exorbitantly for.

OP is a bit misleading though, for instance he calculates salaries from eployees and salaries from programs together. 73% of salaries in 2013 went to people outside the foundation. The foundation employees would average around(give or take some cause it's a year prior and I can't find 2014 info) about 27% of what OP listed.

Likewise, in 2013 travel expenses 77% of the cost was for program trave23% for its employees.

This brings up another point, the $5 billion to grants is exactly that, only to grants. The Clinton Foundation is an operating foundation, which means it spends money on implementing programs. Grants are given to other initiatives for implementing programs and the grant giving types are called non-operating.

It's tough to nail how much is spent on charity, but the OP does no one a service by misrepresenting numbers. A case about effectivity needs analyze it's various programs. The Clinton Foundation isn't really for making money, it's for the connections as programs are implemented internationally, along with prestige and leverage. Think of it as a bargaining chip, they will invest programs in a group for non tangible reciprocation.

First of which, he invents an entirely new system which could (not really) work, but provides no supporting evidence as to why the current accepted theory is false.  
  
Second, his system has some pretty big issues, first of which is his magical extremely powerful magnetic field which would be required to curve that much gas. That would play hell with all navigational equipment, even the humble compass would be rendered useless.   
  
He also doesn't seem to understand atmospheric refraction, which has been well tested and well proven which is why the sun disappears rapidly and before the light goes away. That's explained much better with a round Earth than the single brightest light source magically becoming invisible because it moved too far away.  
  
Could a massively powerful magnet passing through the sky excite neon to create a color spectrum as seen at sunset? Maybe. Could it be done without wreaking havock on electrical and navigation systems? Absolutely not.  
  
Pilots have to reset their plane's gyroscopes every 100 miles or so to maintain an accurate reading. Why is this?  
  
A large pendulum in a vacuum can be used as a clock by placing 24 ticks in a circle around the point. Why?  
  
I have personally experienced the Coriolis effect, I missed every time I didn't account for it. Why?  
  
The planets we observe follow a gravitational model which has yet to be proven wrong and requires the sun be as massive as observed, not magically tiny and close. Why?  
  
We can observe moons moving around Jupiter as it is a spherical object. I can see the moon is spherical with a 30$ pair of binoculars. Why are they spherical but the Earth magically flat?  
  
And finally, my favorite point to bring up, are you able to provide a 2D map of the earth which accurately predicts the distance between any two points?  
  
A global model can do this. Therefore, you have 3 options.  
  
A) Disprove the mathematical proof Theorema Egregium which says there is no possible way to map a 3D object perfectly to a 2D plane of the object.  
  
B) Find an inconsistency in a distance provided by the global model  
  
C) Prove that the Earth is an infinite flat plane which would allow a 3D model to be perfectly mapped on a 2D plane.  
  
Do any of those and you're about ready for a nobel prize. This is one area where you can't magic in an answer like saying ""Oh, well the sun is actually much smaller and way closer.

hoaxing blog stuff and not even from climate scientists. Peer reviewd? By whom? Published? Note that there's no publication information here. It's a document created by non-scientists who apparently know how to ""print to PDF"" but what's interesting is that it's nearly identical to a [skeptic's blog](http://archive.is/V5Hgp) by [Ole Humlum a guy debunked numerous times](https://skepticalscience.com/humlum-at-it-again.html)

Having debated OP before - we see again the typical pattern of posting stuff that's not gone through any scientific peer review, or fact-checking, etc. on these blog sites what you find is that there's a scary title and leading paragraph but then a mish-mash of unscientific stuff below that represents the gish gallop. It fools those who don't read more than the titles of things.

But to really put this away as a Gish Gallop we can take a look at a random sample of the stuff to see if it passes scientific muster. So I looked at the report and I found something very interesting. 

1) Let's look at a chart from the [""Bombshell"" ""Study""](https://thsresearch.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/ef-gast-data-research-report-062717.pdf) on the percent days of temperatures over 95 F. http://imgur.com/TVOp1D5. I've debated /u/timo1200 before on this chart and pointed out to him that this is bogus because the data is unsourced (where exactly did they get this from?), and the number of devices have been reduced over the years, and many have been moved, and many are now in remote locations in places like Alaska. But having discussed this with /u/timo1200 before - I know where this chart came from. It came from Tony Heller's blog and ... read on

2) Let's look at Tony Heller's version http://imgur.com/EmrFGk8 . [[Source](http://archive.is/zGIFO)] Notice a few things: 1) The charts are identical but Heller's says it is from only 1192 stations. When I debated this before I raised the point ... hey - which stations are they? Just remote ones? Silence was the reply. Look at #1 above. It says ""ALL stations"" but then ... why are the graphs IDENTICAL? 

3) Let's put #1 above #2 and make it slightly transparent and scale it to match ... http://imgur.com/cbdbfgE 

The charts are identical but suddenly it's gone from ""1192 stations"" to ""all stations."" It's gone from 9% to 4%. And all that ... with NO change in the actual graph. 
http://imgur.com/a/vLQNI

And so in all of the above - one asks - where's the link to the original data used? What's the methodology for generating those two identical graphs with widely different Y-axes?  http://imgur.com/a/vLQNI. 

I would guess that when you get two identical graphs but completely different Y-axis that this is either incompetence or fraud. But because NONE of these sites actually disclose the actual data used to create the graphs - I would lean toward guessing that they are just making stuff up. 

So .... not just a gish gallop. But made up charts as well to try to fake a point. Sad at best and dishonest at worst. ",conspiracy

You have to go through the reasons of what God was doing with His original people and why there was The Law that no one could follow.  The old testament is foreshadowing of Jesus (Isaiah 53 prophesy).  Jesus came to fulfil the law and we are now in a period of grace and the gentiles (everyone who is not jewish) have been brought into the fold as the Jews turned against Jesus.  The Jews will be brought back into the fold though near the end.

All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.  All deserve eternal torment from a young age or birth.   We all go to court when we die and everyone is guilty unless Jesus died for you and His perfect sinless record plus the sacrifice transfers to our account, and we are adopted by God.  I have a house in Heaven right now.

Romans explains it all. Ecclesiastes (nothing new under the sun) is one of the best philosophical books in history (people just won't read the Bible because the World laughs at the concept).  Proverbs is great.  Romans really shows you this is real though, it hits you like a pile of bricks.  

God loved us SO MUCH to send His son to die for us when we were still His enemies.  This is God's ""Grand Demonstration"" of his glory in His grace that He did that...killing His son to save his enemies, and then loving us like children for all eternity.

Idk, it's frustrating talking about it and people just make jokes.  It's my entire life and always will be even after I die.

I'm not sure how it occurred, or if it was accompanied by other cataclysmic events like a comet hitting the North American ice shelf as is sometimes considered, or a radical pole shift, or both.

There are definitely many missing pieces of information here and a lot of uncertainty on some pretty big things, but the idea that another global species of beings with an advanced understanding of the world around them who built things we couldn't build today with all the tools we have existed and then vanished is pretty much accepted reality for me at this point. Which is not to say I couldn't change my mind if you have a better argument to make against the idea.

&gt; However pyramids would surely be barely left standing after that long?

Pyramids would be about the only thing that can survive that long. They are basically man made mountains, and while they do erode, they remain largely intact over a very long time, as nothing can crumble, nothing can collapse, as there are virtually no spaces built into them other than a handful of specially enforced chambers.

The sphinx has experienced massive erosion, for example. And surprisingly most of it seems to be due to rain if you can believe it. This was another thing that led Hancock and others to consider that the sphinx is much older than conventional egyptologists are ready to admit, as the amount of erosion, coupled with what we know about the history of the climate in egypt would indicate that it was built in a time when egypt was no desert at all, but a rainforest. That was last the case, supposedly at least 10.000 years ago.

And as a side-note. There is a fair amount of evidence too, that the sphinx was originally depicting Anubis, and that the head was modified in the dynastic era of the pharaohs.

This is another point I would like to repeat. If you consider that another civilization built all those structures and was subsequently destroyed by a cataclysm, those cultures that would form after the flood/event in those areas would find those monuments inexplicable and use them for worship and all sorts of things, and generally take care of them, which is why many of them are still almost pristine.

[Full Story - Proof that Big Pharma Doesn’t Care About Vaccine Harm ](http://gaia-health.com/conventional-medicine/pharmaceuticals/proof-big-pharma-doesnt-care-vaccine-harm/)

The so-called 'anti-vaccine' side gets misrepresented by the mainstream media, they are constantly setting up an 'anti-vaccine' strawman and then knocking it down with industry marketing and propaganda disguised as science.  

I've been involved in this for many years, going deep into the research and the debate, the major problems are that vaccines aren't being tested properly, nor is the schedule, unvaccinated people aren't being studied, vaccines are being studied one at a time, not using real controls in safety studies, not looking long-term.  In 2017 vaccines are a shot in the dark!

The only way to work out what's going on is to do the research for yourself, as the system and media has been setup by Big Pharma.  That means going to the independent experts, not Big Pharma vaccine patent holder (i.e. making millions from vaccines) 'experts' like Paul Offit who the mainstream media go to.  I've posted up presentations from the independent experts below, anyone who watches those all the way through will never vaccinate again.

Alternatively if you don't have time for the presentations below, here's an [award-winning documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU32Ojf8-rA) which allows a fair debate, rather than a one-sided strawman.  The media cannot be trusted, they have been compromised, and unfortunately vaccine science has also been compromised, as the doctors below will confirm for you.

He had no idea that at this moment in history, he had accidentally destroyed democracy as we envision it to be. The military and surveillance community immediately picked up on the patent and within two years had reprogrammed their communications and surveillance satellites and terrestrial phased arrays with the new concepts. The rapid deployment of this technology occurred because it only required software changes in already existing radar, imaging, and communications’ terrestrial dishes and satellites. Many additional spy satellites have been launched since to bolster the system. So in 1976, on the bicentennial of this great nation, a system called TAMI was born. TAMI is an acronym for “Thought Amplifier and Mind Interface”. A more invasive “Big Brother” technology came about before George Orwell’s prediction of 1984.

&gt;The global system, TAMI, can hone in on a compatible mind and instantly be able to manipulate it to some varying degree dependent upon many factors. The offense practices their trade by influencing people near a targeted individual to convey information only pertinent to them, for spy games. These people are everyday citizens unfamiliar with this high technology. The effects are so subtle without lots of training to detect, nobody would be the wiser. They would at most just question why they did that or felt the need to say that.

Now, the falling top portion of the building accomplished two feats: it reached nearly free fall speeds AND it pulverized the building below it. Conservation of energy says you can't have both. You either free fall through the air and reach those speeds OR you pulverize the building and fall much slower. The fact that both were observed implies a missing energy source. These engineers and architects are implying the missing energy came from controlled demolitions. That story seems consistent with observations and cold hard physics. The problem comes from what happens when you entertain that possibility. If there were explosives, why wasn't this investigated and who had access to the building to plant them?

Well if you want to that, then you should get rid of the institution of marriage and the nuclear family since typically it is family members who rape and molest children, mostly and often. 

Also there are a lot of broken people out there who have never received help for the trauma the live and deal with on a daily basis. Because our culture rarely gives a fuck about victims, and on certain level, blames people for their abuse or dismisses their claims outright. You see this repeatedly on reddit. 

Frankly, this isn't a question of supply and demand which is what you're trying to make it about. It is about a persistent and overweening rape culture that has more sympathy for rapists and would be rapists than victims. It is a culture you choose to participate in if you ever watch porn, go to strip club, or pay for prostitution.

Many of the victims of childhood sexual abuse in up as so-called ""sex workers"" because any semblance of having a normal life has been taken from them. Mainly because the PTSD from sexual abuse is hard to handle and recover from (that comes from my own experience by the way).

Just remember, when you get a lap dance, there is a significant probability that the woman doing so was at some point sexually assaulted as child. And your pleasure in the moment is a direct consequence of that past. You are complicit in the culture of abuse that creates ""disposable"" humans that are used up for the short-term pleasures of other human beings (typically men).

Again I am dude and was born a dude. Someone with pedo urges that claims they can't control is full of shit. If that is so true and so real, then they should castrate themselves, go live in the mountains, go be a deep sea fishermen, or actively make a plan to not ever be around children. It's not hard to do. It's only hard for them because they think it is everyone else's responsibility to help them, which is the typical abuser's mentality.  ",conspiracy

The way most people approach a topic like this is to compare the conclusion to their existing world view and see if it could possibly be integrated into that world view, if not, it can be rejected out of hand as absurd.  In this case a conclusion that the official cosmology is incorrect does not mesh with the world view of most people.  But this is not a logical process.  Just because an authoritative scientific body, or a majority of population holds a view does not directly translate to that view being correct.

To really know about a subject you have to get into the details, otherwise you have arrived at a conclusion without logic ever coming into the picture.  Do you think people who believe the official story of 9/11 have ever looked into the details of it?   Do you think they even know what the official story is?  They just have a vague idea of the official story, but know that it must be true because their world view does not include the possibility of it being otherwise.

Your statement is logically false.  There would be circumstances that would have to be necessary for a country that didn't have a standing army to be vulnerable to an organized on-scale attack against itself.  Such as having an opponent who had that capacity and a willing populace.  And having no internal checks against external/internal exploitation.  And having no ability to raise an army.  There's a whole list of criteria that would have to be met.  

Also, the question of having capacity is completely different from the question of using it externally against somebody else for no good reason.  Which is the current situation with the US.

And what good has it done for you, having this army?  Do you think you are safer now?  Do you think you are more secure?  I don't think any of that is true.  I think you're worse off than before all the needless war started.    

There are Nash equilibriums that exist where countries can live together non-violently.  There are ways to manifest that equilibrium.  We're just not doing them.
