96,"Hmm. Yep, I'm annoyed by it. Did I ever imply that my annoyance has any meaning at all to what Riot should do? Did I ever say that my opinion has any meaning at all? I simply said what I felt and assumed that a lot of people would feel the same, and that it's something that Riot COULD POSSIBLY CONSIDER. Now, does that mean I'll stop playing league if they, gasp, do something that annoys me? Obviously not, since I'm still here despite that horrendous Cho'Gath rework which is literally impossible to counter if your adc is bad. 

But back to the original issue, think of it like this: you worked for 40 hours per week for a year just so you can buy the latest iPhone. Another dude gave the same effort, but settled for buying a cheapass phone and spent his money on a dank laptop instead. And then, a few months later, Apple announces that they'll give everyone an iPhone. Won't you feel annoyed? Now obviously the analogy is stretched considering the amount of effort and money involved, but it's only to give you a picture of what it looks like to me. And of course, this should go without saying, but I should note that of course this is just me, and whether or not Riot considers this issue is something out of my reach. And whether or not they don't, it won't immediately mean that I'll stop playing league or I'll hate them. ",leagueoflegends

118,Lethality isn't THAT great still use a standard rune page with AD Reds armor yellows AS marks 4 AS blues and 5 MR Blues. Duskblade Rush then go back into Crit with Rapid fire (long range dusk procs) and Infinity edge. Round out your build with Lifesteal and % Pen vs tanks or Lifesteal + Utility (Merc Scim GA) against more damage oriented comps. Ninja Tabis vs heavy AD Merc treads vs lots of CC. Only buy Attack speed boots if you need to heavily output some DPS vs like 3 Tanks (Top Jungle Support picks like Tank Tank Braum/TK). Also in the event you're buying Zerkers you likely won't build duskblade seeing as its only good against squishy targets and you likely wont have access to them easily after laning phase so stick to standard Crit + %pen build.,leagueoflegends

1439,"If we treat this as kind of an economics problem, we need to look at the opportunity cost of having him play other roles/having someone else be the carry. For example, you may be the best player and always tank. What is the cost of your friend tanking? If we use takedowns (kills+assists+towers) as a measure, does your improvement in takedowns outweigh your friend's decrease? Or does he increase as well?

In LoL terms, the carry is sometimes the best player on the team, but roles are all different. You maybe be the best player on your team, but that doesn't mean that you should be the carry if you are used to tanking in DotA. While you and your friend may be able to successfully learn to switch roles, is it worth losing out on the skills you have already developed (to some extent)?

2315,"When you create the account, you can say you're an expert and it just throws you in with other smurfs. If you say you're a beginner, you have no soul.",leagueoflegends
2318,"What is this from, and are we talking about Life of Boris?",leagueoflegends
2353,"**Start watching the minimap NOW.**

The minimap is your window of opportunity.  It lets you see opportunities to help a fight, it lets you see opportunities to avoid getting killed, and it lets you see opportunities that may be developing (such as the skull and crossbones that indicate that dragon is alive, or the fact that 4 of the enemy are heading towards middle tower and you probably need to be en route to help defend).  If you have access to a timer that you can make beep every 5 seconds, do so, and every time it beeps check the minimap.  At least *glance* at it.  But make it a habit that is as natural as breathing.

**The minimap will save your life.**

If there was a second thing, it would be to play selectively aggressive.  By selective, I mean to pick the safe times to play aggressively.  If you carefully select when you want to play aggressive, you will discover more about your champion.  You will learn to spot opportunities to be aggressive, and you will learn to detect those signs of aggression in the opponent.  

**The best way to die is when an enemy gets away with 15 hp but you died.**  On a larger scale, the best way for your whole team to die is if you all died but still managed to kill 4 of their team.  I say that's the best way because you tested your limits.  You learned something about your character, or the enemy, or *something* that might help you survive with 15 hp next time and the *enemy* dies. 

The third pitfall to avoid is to spend a moment thinking about what you want to build, browse the shop, and find what you want to buy.  In other words, get familiar with the items and think about why you would want to spend hard-earned gold on any particular thing.  On the topic of builds, don't be upset if someone criticizes your build.  *They could very well be wrong.*  Or they could be right.  Again, think about why somebody might be making a recommendation, and work from there.  However, if you are locked in to some build you found online, you will foolishly ignore even good advice and limit your own growth as a player.

Guides are *great*.  Guides can show you opportunities that you've missed, or give you new ideas to work off of.  However, they are inflexible.  If you blindly follow guides, the day will come where you will follow it to your own doom.  Don't start with guides.  You will fuck up and you will do great, but do it with your own brain.

Finally, and this one is big, **farming will never let you down**.  That's why so many people say ""last hitting creeps is #1 tip"" but it really isn't the #1 tip.  Farming is earning gold for getting the last hit on a creep.  The goal of the game is to bust down the enemy nexus, and the most reliable way to do that is to be stronger than your opponent.  You get stronger by earning gold and experience.  Every creep that the tower kills or that you allow the minions to kill is a missed opportunity to get slightly stronger than your opponent, and that advantage grows throughout the game.

If you ever think farming is weak, check the scoreboard when there seems to be a single player that's dominating the game.  I bet you 500 Riot Points that the player who is doing the dominating will have the highest number of creeps killed.

PS - attack speed is not a great stat to stack.  If you're working on an AD character, consider balancing attack speed, damage, crit %, armor penetration and **survivability** such as Banshee's Veil.",leagueoflegends

All Xerath does is dishing out different loads of damage, from which only one (his E, which he won't use for poke much) can be blocked by minions. Being so focussed on damage that has to be avoided by constantly dodging makes Xerath so obnoxious to face and hard to buff or nerf properly, unlike e.g. Ziggs who also has utility in his W and E. (Remember they also reworked Fiora's ult into a utility spell, so she wouldn't have to be balanced in regards to her damage potential alone.)

Old Xerath at least had an interesting mechanic in his W that rooted himself, but in return increased his range, which was a much more interesting opportunity of counterplay than his current iteration. I would love if his passive (which is currently super lame in concept and only allows him to spam more spells) was changed to something like his old W. Kind of like Skarner's passive, only that Xerath finds locuses (loci?) of power on the map and can absorb their strength too shoot a lot farther than normal, but limited to those specific spots.",leagueoflegends

&gt; INNATE: Garen regenerates 2 / 8% maximum health every 5 seconds if he has not taken non-minion damage in the last 9 / 4 seconds.

In other words, 2%HP/5 below level eleven.

&gt; INNATE: Gragas heals for 6% maximum health upon using an ability. STATIC COOLDOWN: 8

In other words 3,75%HP/5 if activated on cooldown.

Not only is Gragas' passive far more potent below level eleven, it's also usable in combat and you can not prevent it in any way. Sure, you have to activate Gragas' passive, but you do that easily with his W which costs 30 mana. 

Why is it so that you can prevent Garen's passive entirely while Gragas is allowed to utilize his however he pleases while it's also almost twice as potent?

On another note, synergy with a team is not the same as playing well at your position. Yeah TSM puts a lot of faith in doublelift and because of the team atmosphere it does seem like they mesh well as a team but in Phreak's tier list it's continually contradictory to the idea that team synergy matters. Piglet was third, wasn't he? If we're rating ADCs based on team performance, he's in the shitter.

Double smite: Lvl 1 Red?  OP!  Many of the upper 3v3 ranked elo players bring double smite for complete jungle dominance.

8566,"&gt;you can observe plenty of people with multiple mastery pages in a climate where it's not required since you can edit them in champ select

Ya and I don't think many people at all would pay for mastery pages. The main argument here isn't that what was paid for is now 'cheaper' (I'm not even sure there will be any change in the pricing of rune pages, at least not that I've seen), that means absolutely nothing to me. It's the fact that what I bought is not what i'm getting anymore. It would be like if I bought a TV from a store, used it for a year, and then the guy who sold me the TV said, ""Hey, we're just gonna take your TV and give you a worse one, don't worry you got your moneys worth from the other one, and this one works just fine!"".

To reiterate, the issue isn't that the things I bought have decreased in value, that's to be expected, anyone who buys anything should understand that it won't be worth as much in the future, but instead the concern is the fact that I am literally no longer getting the product I purchased. The only reason (most) people buy rune pages is because you can't change them in champ select, If you couldn't change masteries in champ select people would buy extras of those too, but since you can pretty much no one would. What people paid for, either with IP or RP, was the ability to have more options going into games, and there is no reason other than convenience to have multiple rune pages when you can change them in champion select.

I'll agree 100% that the change to runes is a good one, but I think everyone should be given 20 rune pages (just like masteries) and people who bought pages should be given some form of compensation, not full compensation because that's ridiculous, but some form nonetheless.",leagueoflegends

A ranged dps with good range should hit him before he gets spells off to do damage to his health, while avoiding standing in the middle of your minions.  And if he's keeping his shield up to avoid damage to his health, he'll be pushing, so get ganks on him.  
Silences and stuns also really help stop him filling his shield. His early creeping death aoe is on a very long cooldown, and is his best source of charging his shield, so you want to engage after that is used.  ",leagueoflegends

It removes her safe trap combo with any Ally cc, but that's fine since her net let's her do the same damage pattern, but with a real investment.

Traps are an issue because they give Caitlyn a ton of burst and area control, and have no risk or investment required (other than cooldown) since they're ranged. And using them on cc'd enemies is a chunk of guaranteed damage with only the one charge of investment.",leagueoflegends

Ahri's range is not enough to reach for cs without Ori punishing her with a combo every single time. People in silver generally don't really think about trading this way though. It's not as simple as 'they can't hit skillshots so they do bad on Ori', it's that Ori is good when you understand how laning *actually* works, which is more about anticipating your opponents movement than aiming a skill.

It is also because Rhaast is a tank killer. He is made that way. He does % max HP dmg on his Q and R and heals based on the enemies max HP regardless of their resistances on his second R part and post mitigation on all of his skills (passive).

In this clip his second R part heals him for ~30% of Rammus max HP which is 1110 HP (3700 max HP). He also has BC and LDR so he can ignore a lot of the armor. His full Q (both parts together) does ~390 + 30% max HP and his R 625 + 42.5% max HP.  All the dmg he does also heals him for 50% of the dmg dealt + 5/15% from DD.

I play him nowadays because I actually enjoyed warding when I mained supports.  One of the interesting things when I play him, though, is that it seems to cause the rest of the team to buy wards as well after my mushrooms/wards have saved them from a gank or two.

- Give a her a passive that isnt some crappy minigame passive where you collect dragons (i would still accept her old passive)

- Make it so the movement speed buff from her w does not diminish over time anymore

- Give her the 20% bonus damage to monsters back to compete with early pressure junglers

This being said i do not think she is in a super weak state and think she is still very playable in almost all elos.

1200, 1300, 1300, 1300, 1400

Will tend to lose against a team like this:

1000, 1300, 1300, 1300, 1600

Even if they have the same average Elo.

Higher rated players drag a team's average Elo up more than lower rated players drop it. Riot have stated this explicitly on more than one occasion. This is what I mean by 'carry effect' being stronger than 'feeder effect'. So if *you personally* are underrated, then you drag your team's average Elo up. And the *more* underrated you are, the more you drag it up, in a non-linear fashion, resulting in people who are extremely underrated winning 9/10 games, even if they're only one person out of a team of 5.

What kinds of rewards are in the Honor capsules?

The minimum loot in an Honor Capsule is two key fragments. There's a chance to get more key fragments, and there's a high rate of champ shards, too.

If you nab the skins, they unlock for free, and you'll get the champ if you don't already own them.

How do I get Honor Capsules?

17133,"Your support picks are strong so it's not your champions holding you back. Thresh in particular is a power pick. 

I suggest watching one of your replays and paying attention to your mid-game and late-game macro movements. Are you ever caught alone warding? Killing minions in side lane? Too far from the start of a teamfight? Those are the most impactful, game-losing mistakes players make at your elo. Especially because if you get caught, either 1. teammates jump in to save you and they get caught as well leading to a snowball effect 2. your team 4v5's because it's just irresistible at that elo

I personally believe if your macro is good enough you can lose lane and still win the game most of the time, but a laning tip is to keep track of minion aggro. Caster minions deal a ton of damage if you let them shell away at you. Dodge into the brush to de-aggro casters.

17286,"That's not really what it means to have diminishing returns, though. Armour increases tankiness linearly, just like Bonus AD increases Total AD linearly.

Diminishing returns would be something like, if we imagine a hypothetical game system where you have the stat Strength and the stat Damage:

If you have =&lt; 10 strength, every point of Strength gives 1 Damage

But if you have more than 10, you only get 0.5 Damage for each point of Strength

See what I mean? Every point of Strength above 10 is objectively worse than the points before 10.

Neither Armor/MR or AD really have diminishing returns.

&amp;nbsp;

Here's another way of thinking about it:

Say you're taking a constant amount x of physical damage per second. This will allow you to survive for y seconds.

Every additional point of armour adds the *same* amount of seconds to your survival time.

It's true that if you can already survive for 10 minutes, then 1 extra second is not a lot in comparison, but this is not what it means to have diminishing returns.",leagueoflegends

-how frequently the champ was free relative to when the champ was released

-what are the intervals in which the champion gets free

So the first metric will prioritize champions that are released often, e.g. Ashe, Annie.

The second one will prioritize champions that are due to be released based on their schedule. So for example, Jax is usually free every 9th to 11th week. He was last free during week 44. So Jax is given a high modifier since he's due for another release soon.

I'm still tweaking the formulas though. For example, a weakness in the second formula is that as the pool of champions become bigger, we should expect the intervals for each champion to become longer as well, since they need to fit more champions into the rotation.

Not because tanks are bad per se, but more because i have to pick something and a tank (like gragas) has just as much, arguably more, impact as jungler. Or tank supports (braum, tk say hi) are really strong aswell.

Players like CruzerTheBruzer and Nyjacky were starters because there wasn't enough talent. The midlaner from a random LPL team comes to NA and easily becomes top 3 in NA, keeping in mind the one of the other top 3 mids is from EU. So yeah, a few years ago there was definitely a lack of talent, and that's where this idea that NA lacks talent has come from.

I like it on Vayne/MF/Ashe/most ranged carries situationally. I also generally build Wriggle's + Brutalizer on Nocturne and late game upgrade Brutalizer to Ghostblade and pick up a Black Cleaver because they work really well together. I can also see it working on other champions that build Brutalizer (i.e. ""AD casters"" who benefit from pure AD more than crit and stuff) like Renekton.

Because not doing it probably makes the experience worse for 3 people in your team. I do understand that games can be turned around, and I do understand that you won't want to surr on the first or the second vote, maybe not even after that. But at some point shouldn't it be better for you and your team to just move on to the next game or take a break after you lost another teamfight/objective? That's what the function is for imho - a lost game that doesn't turn around the first few tf tries likely won't do so on the next one, especially not with one or more tilted players on your team.

You don't want to surrender rankeds, fine by me. I disagree that you should never surrender ranked, but I get *and* I accept that attitude, which is why I never talk back at anyone not surrendering a ranked.

20555,"Hey, hate to be the buzzkill here since I'm not suggesting Annie.
I'm no master of league but a good champ to main is Talon because there's not much that he lacks.
To give a few pros:

* High mobility - his Q is a gap closer that, with decent decision making, helps you reach the right targets (especially since it's point-click). His E is quite literally parkour that can be used for gap closing and escaping, and though it has internal cooldowns, makes for a very useful ability if used properly, hence the maining aspect. If it's any use, his ult gives him bonus MS (scaling with rank) that lets you either position on a carry or run from a fight, both of which you can use frequently since the cooldown is low late game.

* Waveclear - this is has been debated for a while (at least in my circles) but since his W is AoE, it helps with the tried and true shove and roam technique. He clears minion waves pretty quick so in a few match ups you're free to push out and roam (more on this later). In match ups where you get pushed in, W allows you to clear from a relatively (relative to opponent champ's range) safe distance. It's a useful tool for CS'ing when you're new to him too.

* Kill potential - this is pretty straightforward; During the early game, he has insane (and often unexpected) amount of burst with his level 2 and level 6 all-in's because of his bleed passive and the damage you get in one spell rotation, coupled with auto attacks which hurt. If you were to run ignite against a squishy mid lane opponent, it's nearly almost guaranteed that you will either get a kill at level 2/6 or at the very least a summoner spell or two. As a side note, his W-Q combo is pretty good poke early and using only his W gets you good poke onto a target. He spikes midgame and 100-0 anyone maybe other than a (fed) tank. He wears down tanks too over time but usually sustain beats burst so your job anyway is pretty much to delete the carries in a fight or pick them out. Late game he falls off a bit, like other traditional assassins but his burst and one shot potential is still pretty good on squishies and if you get the ADC or fed mage, you win the fight. 

* Variable playstyles (in the laning phase) - again, pretty debatable, feel free to correct me wherever you think I'm wrong, but Talon can be played in a couple of styles. The most common is where you focus on roaming and pretty much shove and roam all throughout laning phase to either help get other lanes ahead or get yourself a kill or two to start the snowball. Talon has really good roaming potential cause of his kit and it's insane how easy it is to get that first kill in bot lane. It also helps that he snowballs very hard and can often use that to his advantage in lane and out of lane; one kill is enough for you to carry up to the mid game and stay relevant in the late game (after all you only have to delete the squishies). The other is to focus only on your lane and try to go even in CS and maybe get a kill in lane or an advantage to have the opponent fall behind. I'm sure there are more ways to play him, just not going to list them all or else this will get longer than it already is. Now I'm not saying that all the playstyles are the most efficient, but just putting it out there that Talon has different playstyles that you can use depending on how you like to play. In all cases though, it would be about trying your best to snowball a lead so you hit your spike faster (which is kind of the meta way of winning now) and if you don't, it's okay because you tend to stay relevant throughout the game. I would refer to [r/talonmains](https://reddit.com/r/talonmains) for this.

* Meta - Talon manages to stay a good or decent pick in every meta (obviously player skill should be taken into account too) and only sometimes does he feel really weak, like when lethality was nerfed and when it was released. Right now though, he sits at a 52% winrate and the lethality buffs and the change to its scaling has made it perfect for snowbally solo laners such as him. He even builds duskblade which at the time of writing is pretty broken.

Cons:

* Tough/unfavorable matchups - the current mid meta favors ranged mages that have some form of utility and damage or some poke such as Orianna (never a bad time to pick her lol), Syndra, Corki. One of the biggest counters to Talon (and every assassin in general) is CC so anyone with some form of it makes it just a bit tough for you to play against. This is where 'farming with W' comes in. Since you're melee it makes it pretty easy for a lot of mages to poke you down so that makes laning a bit hard and hence why roaming is a better option. Don't take it that heavily though cause his laning is still better than a lot of assassins.

* Team reliance - yes you can carry the game with him quite well if you master him but since he's an assassin, it's easy to block him out of a fight if the opponent team is coordinated. You need your team to help you get to the right people and since it's solo q, that gets slightly tough. In lane, you need jungle pressure often because you get pushed in relatively easy by mages and usually that also means they put themselves in danger which is potential to net you a kill in case you do get your jungler to gank.

To conclude, it's nice to have that Talon is pretty fun to play and has huge carry potential in a meta where the outcome depends on how well you do early and midgame. He's also relatively easy to pick up and somewhat tough to master but you reap the benefits of doing so anyway.

23298,"Unfortunately, GA is standard for build on ADCs at the moment, and has been since the change.

Which is kinda a huge handicap on adcs and I'd really prefer for adcs to be empowered to build more damage than we are right now.

Back in season 5, a normal build could get anywhere from 380-450 ad depending on the final item (scimitar, bork, second zeal, ga, banshees).

Now, adcs are barely breaking 340 ad with necessary GA and LW purchases that don't even notably increase damage vs squishies, inf is often dropped for er, both give less ad than before, and scimitar gives less ad and often doesn't fit in builds.

BUT IT'S OK, we have less overall attack speed and 70-80% crit with only three crit items (vs 90 before, also this is dropping below 300 total ad *and* completely skipping out on built lifesteal, unless you're willing to sell boots, which is riskier and riskier in higher elo, and is akin to skipping GA atm.)

At least we have 50% crit with two instead of 40 from old Shiv+Inf. Also, shit's cheaper, and keystones add some missing lifesteal/movespeed/ad. Only thing we objectively have more of is movespeed tbh, the warlord's lifesteal is worse than just having 20-30% lifesteal, and fervor's ad does balance out some of the missing ad from older builds but is locked behind a stacking mechanic.

They tell you the system works a certain way, but it isn't all that true. It is easily abusable by 4 players. You can decide to surrender just before the nexus explodes, and then get your 5th punished easily by just saying. 'He was so toxic that he didn't deserve the win, please report.'  Yes, I am speaking from experience.

The same goes for honor (the old system). With 4 you could get 3x honor every game and after 7-10 games you would get the banner... even though they say multiple honors from the same people mean less/honor means more from someone who doesn't do it.

RP are bought in the shop with real money. You can buy champions, skins, IP and EXP boosts with it.  
IP are gained by playing matches. You can buy champions and runes with it.  

Runes give your champion ingame-stats (like attack damage, ability damage, armor, ...etc). You equip runes into runepages out of game; you can select different pages in champion selection (but not alter them; you have to do it before you queue up).

**Save your IP!** Do not spend it immediately at early levels. You probably will regret later how you spent them.

If you want to invest real money, you should probably buy champions (characters) with those RP, because it will ""unlock"" more of the game for you and they can be quiet expensive when bought with IP.  
You want to spend your IP on runes, because those can be crucial for specific play styles / strategies (e.g. you need correct runes to clear when jungling; it's easier to last hit minions for gold early on with attack damage runes equiped).
Since you can buy the good runes from level 20 onwards, don't bother with them now (even though the ealry level runes only cost 1IP, so... maybe get them... it's like 1 game for all of them ;D )

When you hit 7 or 8 (when you are done with the tower top), do the blue buff and start ganking.

In teamfights, you need to poke and heal (Q and E them). Once you guys are winning and they start running, heal your teammates and pop cougar form.

This goes back to my point about NA viewing things exclusively in extremes, instead of actually looking at the reality of the situation. So read that again. It's like saying that you either support anarchism or communism in politics (2 opposites). I'm tired of trying to make it more obvious than it already is that NA relies heavily on their imports, while also having more, than EU does. That matters without a doubt. 

Stop trying to tell me what we're talking about, it's what you're talking about. 

Who said they had to be 100% full of natives? Stop acting like they're only 2 extreme opposites again. 

EU has 9 imports, while NA has 18. How on earth are you NA fans once again telling me that EU and NA are the same in one more regard, when it's clearly not the case. Add that onto the importance of imports for both regions, and it's even more loopsided. 

Now add onto that the fact that there is twice as many Europeans at Rift Rivals, and it's all supporting my stance. 

Fnatic is the strongest team for Europe, and it has no imports. Every NA team has imports at rift rivals. 

There is layers upon layers of evidence supporting my claim. 

If you can't deal with that, then that's too bad, but it doesn't change it, no matter how much you want it to be different. I cba to try and explain this to you any further.

25398,"It should be easy to climb since you would gain way more lp than you would lose if you have high elo. The system thinks that you are good enough to be able to compete evenly with whoever you are playing against. The system knows that even if you are better than your peers, people can't win it all so they compensate by making you lose a lot less lp than if you played with your peers in bronze 1. That way you would climb super fast. True elo hell is having lower elo than your peers at your rank, because fixing that elo would make it seem like you are not progressing at all. You would gain 15 lp a win and lose 25 lp with a loss. You can only fix this by winning a large percentage of your games while not seeing any progress lp-wise. You know you belong in the rank you are in when the lp you gain and the lp you lose is the same.   
And we have that as our ranking system because people like to see progress, and the promos and series are addictive. Also, it helps gate progress so that you can't just shoot up to Plat from bronze in 15 games. ",leagueoflegends

dont mute everyone at the beginning of the game.

instead-

communicate with your team. its a TEAM GAME. go play diablo if you dont enjoy playing with others.
When someone is being toxic just mute him it takes exactly 1 second to do so.
i know that sometimes there are games where all of your team and the enemies are being unfriendly and there you can and should mute all. but thats maybe 1 out of 30 of games. 
muting everyone at the start is 100% the wrong attitude.
also with the honor update a lot of toxicity is gone and if you are being nice all others are going to be nice to you!

Adcs also struggle from being more easily gankable than most mids, due to both mobility and a lack of cc, being unable to clear waves as quickly as mids, and having extremely poor roams. Overall, mids are better suited for applying pressure in the midlane and using this pressure to impact the rest of the map, while also being better in the 1v1 after level 6.

27717,"Something to go along with the ""law of large numbers"" point.  Every game you have 9 ""random"" players and yourself, so think of it like this;

Each player is has a skill level between 1 and 10.  

Each individual player has a set number

Every game has 10 random [numbers] players and the team with the higher number wins.

If you are in the game then you have 4 random numbers on your team and 5 on the other, so if your ""skill number"" is 6 or above you are more likely to win

Obviously if rng isnt on your side its possible to be a 10 and get four 1's on your side while the other team gets five 8's [14&lt;40], but as OP stated, in the long run, if you truly are better than the competition it will even out.

Don't put emphasis on the short term wins and loses, just improve every game.  If I lose a game but I learned from it and improved from a 5 to a 6, then I just went from ""more likely to lose"" to ""more likely to win"".

But I don't think the rework was a failure, I think their balancing afterwards was the problem.

Zac had one of the lowest dmg done stat per game and they nerfed his dmg. They thought ""lets hit the jungle speed like that"" but there are other ways to just nerf the jungle speed without hurting his dmg too much. The first W dmg nerf was ok, this last one was crap.

What made Zac great? His reliability combined with the jungle clear. they shredded his jungle clear to be pretty slow so that he can't keep up anymore, which means he likely falls out of the jungle.

Instead they should have mostly hit his reliability. 

- Q leash range is too large and has the same problem as LeBlancs leash (updates every ~0.25 sec instead which leads to it proccing even after you flashed away). Increasing the update speed of the Q and reducing the leash range so that you can flash out of the Q range and not get drawn back in would have helped a lot

- Just make Q cost 4% current  HP and the AA afterwards also 4% current HP (nearly the same as it is now, just that you don't lose 4% HP if you can't get the second part off)

- W: Yes, take a bit of dmg away if needed, but 25 flat dmg is huge, too huge.

- E range. Yes, the E range is like that for a long time now, but it is crazy. Just 0-200 less range. 1200-1600 range is still a huge range (maximum channel duration would also need to go down to 0.9-1.2 from 0.9-1.3 sec)

- R is too fast to channel. You can miss the E and land next to a minion, then Q and if the enemy doesn't flash that Q he is probably dead because you can AA a minion, pull him back and R during that pull already. Increase the channel time to 1.2 sec (maybe 1.25) from 1.1 sec to give an enemy that gets pulled by the Q a better chance to get out of his R.

Such nerfs would have helped way more than all the dmg nerfs to his W and the pretty useless CD increase to his Q. In the end they gutted his W so that he will not be playable and say ""we have found out what we want to do with him"". In the end Riot should have used such nerfs patch after patch to try and get him in line. Instead they nerfed him a bit and a bit and then just but off his head instead of going the last step.

&gt; Just to let you guys know there's a simple method to minimize the effect drophacking has. When a drophacking attempt on a game is obvious (like when you're pushing down the nexus and suddenly everyone dcs) don't quit the game to try to reconnect. Instead just spam click like you would when moving your character. Doing this never dcs you from the game and the game never ends.

32207,"[Jon ‘Riot Twillig’ Tsao wrote on Jul 23, 2016 6:00 PM –](http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/articles/previewing-our-new-esports-hud):

&gt;**TL;DR: **We’ve been working on some improvements to the broadcast HUD to make esports matches clearer and easier to watch. Still a work in progress, but we wanted to share some of our early thoughts with you on what an updated HUD could look like and get your feedback. Read on for some more details and a progress video to learn more.  
&gt;  
&gt;The current spectator HUD was released more than four years ago when League of  
&gt;Legends esports was still in its infancy. We think we can improve on the  
&gt;original design and make it easier and more fun for you to follow matches with  
&gt;all the information you need.  
&gt;  
&gt;We've created a new HUD specifically with esports broadcasts in mind that  
&gt;we’re starting to share with players for feedback and wanted to share with you  
&gt;a sneak peek at our progress so far. We had two major goals when we started  
&gt;investigating new designs:  
&gt;  
&gt;  * **Get rid of the clutter and optimize for viewing the action. **The current HUD takes up a lot of space on the screen, and often covers up important gameplay. To try to solve this, we’ve rethought the layout and have cut down and consolidated the elements on the screen.  
&gt;  * **Enable you to more quickly and easily understand the state of the game. **At the moment, it’s not always easy to follow stats and info during a pro match. We’ve taken a pass at everything from readability of ult cooldowns to easier comparisons between lane match-ups.  
&gt;  
&gt;Here’s a video that shows some of our work so far to create a cleaner and  
&gt;clearer viewing experience. We’re still polishing many of the features and  
&gt;incorporating elements you’re used to seeing on the broadcast, but it’s a good  
&gt;early guide to the evolving design.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;We’re continuing to test the new HUD out and gathering feedback, and will  
&gt;follow up with more information on when you can expect to see this debut. In  
&gt;the meantime, please comment on how you watch and what you like and dislike  
&gt;about both the current spectator HUD and the new HUD.

Tanks: Cho (will not be top after 7.15 probably), Maokai, Shen and in niche cases Galio (mostly mid these days).

Jungle: Zac, Elise, Gragas, Kha, Cho, Mao, Seju, Kha, Rek'sai, Rumble and Lee. Yeah, we have a tank majority there, but also some none tanks. Does that one role with a tank majority make it a tank meta?

People should start differentiating between a tank meta and a TANKY meta.

And that AD assassins don't show up when Tanks or tanky champs are there is also wrong (to a certain degree). Earlier this season we had Talon and Zed even with a top lane being mostly dominated by tanks and Camille. We also had Lth Jayce and Lth ADCs at that time. The Assassin just wants to hit the ADC or mid laner and he needs a good laning matchp. If he can splitpish a bit in the 1-3-1 or flank it is ok. We had AD assassins with tanks or tanky champs more than once. Sure, they need to be more careful and have less targets, but in a time where people call all of them OP as fuck due to DB in soloQ they should be viable (except all the soloQ specialists are wrong, which is more likely due to the stats not showing any AD assassin being OP).",leagueoflegends

NA went 0-10 and Fnc and OG destroyed everyone in their path but koreans (NA included). So yeah, ""for years"" as in last year at best. The only year EU hasn't reached semis at worlds was S4. One year. If NA was on par ""for years"" they would get there at least once...so far, that remains a goal to achieve.

RR was fun for bragging rights and test the meta between EU vs NA teams, but EU still did better than NA, China and TW just the month before at MSI, which actually maters for seeding at worlds. I would give the edge to NA teams atm but there's a lot of time until worlds and for teams to adapt to that patch's meta.

If you like Pantheon, play him.  I feel he's a ton of fun, and completely unique from any other champion. As a couple of guides from pro players have said recently (Dyrus and Westrice, who both play enough Pantheon to write a guide about him), he is probably hte only champion who can run revive without being made fun of.  In fact, I would even recommend it. Team fight starts, and you die? Revive, and ulti back in there! If done right, that can swing teamfights in your teams favor.

Once the global ulti rework is done, he's only going to get stronger.  Riot admits that they nerfed him too hard, so you're going to see some nice buffs in the coming patches.

35290,How does it feel to hit Bronze 5 on NA?,leagueoflegends
35297,"And I said shes not really ""one of the hardest"" 

&gt;Vayne is hard because so many people feel the need to focus her ASAP compared to other ADC's.

that's kind of flawed because it's really consistent, it depends on your elo, the enemy team, you could have a 1-0 ezreal get heavily focused because he is the biggest threat on that team just for example. Also there is teams that DO NOT focus a vayne either because they are not very good, or there is a bigger threat than her, that's a very loose argument. It is one thing to condemn an ally W'in you, it is another to know how to position yourself to instead stun the ally to a wall, that takes some skill.

Caitlin's Q is only used early game, it's a pretty wide skillshot used mainly pushing the wave and if you can hit the enemy as well with it, it's not really that difficult of an ability to land not as say an Ezreal Q which is even more crucial to him, a Cait can win late without ever landing a Q on an enemy champion simply by hard shoving the lane.

Her is pretty hard to miss since it's pretty wide and fast ability, plus a lot of times you'll be using it against a champion running towards you.

A lot of other champions who's ults require good positioning such as Draven, Ezreal,Twitch, Ashe. Plus her ult is guaranteed damage unlike a lot of other ADCs.

36259,"I'm sorry but Yasuo is the most OP champion in the game. Double crit and constant knockups...

I don't care that you're a diamond 1 yasuo main and you lose games to X and Y counters or need to have Z condition satisfied to win a teamfight, he's just in a state where he dictates the flow of the whole game simply by existing.

Master Yi, Yasuo, Kayle, and Tryndamere require you to keep a thumb firmly placed on top of them for the entire game, while having a strong enough early game that you have to constantly worry about whether or not they can jump on and kill you. Kayle, Tryndamere, and Yi have cooldowns that can be abused. Fight them while their ults are down and you can lock them down and kill them easily without much fear of retaliation. Yasuo has Windwall, and honestly it's not that abusable because the knockups provide a lot of defense and utility for him too.

Not only does Yasuo have the best mobility of the four (it's conditional, but Tryndamere's is the only unconditional one and it's a bad skill tbh), with the least important abusable cooldown (and everything else being constantly available), he also doesn't use mana, has the biggest offensive steroid, and does just as much damage as the rest.

No, you can't just stand there and duel someone. Yasuo is at his weakest against a solitary enemy. But if his weaknesses are lockdown, dueling while surrounded by his own minions, and ""being difficult to play,"" I really can't see why he shouldn't be considered way overtuned.",leagueoflegends

38228,"TL;DR: It is more complicated, yes, it is possible for SKT to make it to playoffs but still can't make it to Worlds.

I messed up a bit in my response. To clear it up:

There are 3 spots(seeds) for Worlds with different ways to secure:

* 1^st seed: Winning Summer Split, that's it;

* 2^nd seed: Accumulating the highest Circuit Points(CP, points you get from playoffs result, the higher you rank, the more points you get);

* 3^rd seed: Winning the Regional Qualifiers

The current CP stand is:

&gt; SKT 90, from being 1^st in Spring

&gt; KT 70, from being 2^nd in Spring

&gt; SSG 50, from being 3^rd in Spring

&gt; MVP 30, you know the logic now

&gt; AFS 10

CP from Summer would weight more than Spring, which is:

&gt; 1^st: 0 but doesn't matter as the team will be the 1^st seed by default

&gt; 2^nd: 90

&gt; 3^rd: 70

&gt; Etc.

So, mathematically speaking, it is possible that SKT makes it to playoffs but doesn't secure Worlds, let's say

* SSG wins Summer, so they get the 1^st seed;

* KT is the second runner, so they will accumulate 160 CP.(70+90)

* SKT is placed third, so they will also accumulate 160 CP.(90+70)

In this scenario, it will result a tire-breaker between SKT and KT to determine who get the 2^nd seed.

If SKT lose, KT will be the 2^nd seed; SKT will be placed as the 1^st seed in the Regional Qualifiers which is also held in a gauntlet format. If SKT beat the final challenger, they are the 3^rd seed, otherwise, GG.

In other words, yes, SKT can make it to playoff but still can't make it to Worlds. However, if they can secure a Summer final spot, they are auto-qualified to Worlds as they will hold the highest CP anyway. The matter will be about being the 1^st seed or the 2^nd seed at that point.

I don't think SKT will not make it to Worlds tho, the split is far from over, they still have enough time to get back in track.",leagueoflegends

Either its a group of people or its one person who own's multiple channels and uses 1 editor to make all the videos. The videos are always just stream clips smashed together with no editing apart from maybe a Watermark that belongs to the channel and not the streamer. 

Most of the channels provide links to the streams of each person used in the video but I do agree these channels are benefiting off of literaly doing nothing but downloading a pre-rendered video (stream clip) and putting it into a video editing software with no editing. Add a little crappy watermark and a end screen with Project: Fiora footage (again not there property) and then adding a few links to previous videos on that channel.

Who ever owns these channels has only one interest and that is to make as much money for the least ammount of effort.

Streamers should flag these channels for stealing content and money. (the money the channels make could be made on the actual stream by watching adds or people liking said stream and donating).

One of the most damning pieces about the US political system was the 2016 democracy index study by The Economist, in which the US barely missed the category ""full democracy"", placing second highest in category ""flawed democracy"". There were far poorer, and less developed countries that were determined to have a stronger democracy than the US, Mauritius in Africa and Uruguay in South America being the most obvious examples here.

Piglet is pretty reliable as an ADC, but he also has his moments when he thinks ""I need to carry this alone"" and goes full ham.

Instead of fixing their problems (synergy, macro game, laning power) they bring in another player again that can only play with Inori, who is likely going to struggle in this jungle meta.

41894,"Full text of complaint: 

We represent 11 teams and 5/6ths of the countries from the South East Asian (SEA) region in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, and Indonesia.

We are writing to protest the last-minute extraordinary rule change by Garena which has been announced only just now, after the regular summer seasons for our countries professional leagues have ended, that Vietnam will be awarded an unprecedented two spots in the upcoming GPL tournament in less than one month.  

While we do not deny the remarkable and triumphant showing put on by our brothers at MSI this year, we would like to point out they did not play under their banner of GAM nor did they play under the banner of their country, Vietnam.  They played under the banner of South East Asia (SEA.)  They were not just representing themselves nor just representing their country's league, they were representing our entire region as a whole and accordingly garnered the support and admiration of all us in doing so.  Their success awarded our region an extra slot at the 2017 worlds championship per the rules of the tournament published long before the MSI commenced.  

While we understand Garena wanting to reward Vietnam for their success; we object to the abrupt and arbitrary nature of this profound change and its effect on the upcoming premier tournament of our region.  If Garena wishes to implement a rule of this nature in the future, we would both understand and support its incorporation.  Yet, deciding in the midst of the competitive season, however seemingly justified, to change the rules in such a monumental fashion without reasonable or due notice (which we would argue would be before the start of the summer split) would be fundementally unfair.  It would be akin to Riot rewarding Korea by announcing, out of the blue, that it would be awarded 5 seeds at worlds based on previous performance.  While this would seem justifiable taken in isolation, there are reasons why this is not the case. An arbitrary and seemingly random rule change of this magnitude, made at the eleventh hour, would be almost universally rejected.

It is no secret that Vietnam is the most competitive country in our region.  For us lesser regions we saw the MSI result and reward as our opportunity to finally make a stand at the largest most storied and significant Esports tournament on the planet in the League of Legends World Championship.  Many of us invested increased resources and effort to take advantage of this opportunity.  Some of us spent significant amounts of money (especially for our region) on foreign boot camps and talent.  Many of our players and staff also doubled down on improving their craft, taking time away from their families and loved ones.  Now, at the cusp of achievment, we are told the competitive landscape will be significantly different tomorrow than what it was yesterday.  This is fundementally unfair to both our players and our efforts.  

Finally, while this rule appears to be designed to the benefit of the Vietnam Esports scene, already the most advanced in the region, it will have a significant chilling effect on the growth and professionalism of LOL Esports in our region as a whole, particularly in the places where it is needed most. 
We implore Riot to maintain the integrity of our league and recind this rule that significantly affects the competitive landscape of our league without fair and adequate prior notice.  We recognize we are small countries without the prior successes or financial backing of other regions.  Nevertheless, through their hard work and sacrifice, our players have earned the right to a stable, predictable, and above all else, fair, competition.

Composition over inheritance (or composite reuse principle) in object-oriented programming is the principle that classes should achieve polymorphic behavior and code reuse by their composition (by containing instances of other classes that implement the desired functionality) rather than inheritance from a base or parent class.

To me the response somewhat holds in how NA successfully found a better way to play around the map, simple as that. But the ""violence"" of how it has been done, and how bad EU looked, is imo due to unpreparation and EU teams lacking adaptation.

EU meta was more early pressure, shaping their ways through soem skimershes early, then snowball and take leads from there. NA was more quiet, not letting EU ways to create those picks from where they could snowball, but also group every time you can and create havocs once you're five, with a heavy heavy stress put on midlane. EU has been poor at controlling their sidelanes : NA easely have been shoving them and setting their collapse. Their have been many other factors, but basicly it came down to this : *EU has done nothing to keep NA away from their win conditions, while NA did kept EU from creating the picks they needed*.

It was a big mistake, but an avoidable one. I'm pretty sure EU could ahve trained other regions meta, they would have realized ""oh gragas jungle pick actually is something"" ""ok there is soemthing we are not doing quite right towards sidelane famring"" and would have put an answer to NA.

43823,"Most important thing in mid lane where bursty champions mostly live is trading, if you optimize your trading csing will be much easier as there is less pressure on you.

So tips for trading: 
1. Pay attention to cooldowns, if your enemy uses their damaging abilities, it's safe to move up to last hit, if not you have to be more wary and potentially use your own abilities to last hit.

2. Matching with 1. The best time to try to hit your opponents with your abilities is when they move up to last hit, try to catch then in auto animation because it's much harder to dodge, or they'll have to miss the cs to do so.

You may not think this is relevant, but if you get good at this, you'll be able to roam around without missing much cs, because your opponent won't be able to push. This will help raise your cs/min and map pressure at the same time.",leagueoflegends

This is beside the point, however, as the original argument was surrounding a potential Korean dominance in Dota 2 if they ever took it seriously, and the guy argued that Korea could dominate after only 1 year/season. Anyone who's followed the Dota scene knows that's speculative nonsense. The most rational position to stand by would be ""it's a possibility given that they do well in other e-Sports but it's not a guarantee"". After a few years? A while?

I can see how it'd be bad early but I also like the idea of playing Rakan more as an off tank (colossus over windspeakers and a more off tank build). 

I currently do ancient coin on him and it seems okay but I wasn't sure. I do like it for the regen since he's mana hungry in lane and with the buffs coming it may be better. 

Spellthief seems interesting. I avoided it because his Q poke is a bit hard to pull off and I felt coin regeneration would be better on him. But I'll give it a shot. The quest could definitely be useful. 

I currently build him with coin and go ardent and redemption. Then I tend to go a bit off tank. I like to weave through them so I build for some meat on his bones. Not sure if that's the norm (I like itemizing on my own and then looking up actual builds) but it seems to have some good results.

I'm not actually saying Froggen is better than Jensen, just deconstructing your argument that it's because of game losses that Jensens dpm is low. Jensen is funneled the most gold post 15 by his team out of any midlaner in the LCS (Oracles Elixir) and his most played champs are relatively high in the avg DPM department (Taliyah, Ori, Syndra).

Riot can't hang their hat on how competitive and passionate people are about the game, then convince people an inconsistent experience is fine in a competitive environment.  There is a certain amount of toxicity in League directly maintained by bugs.

46427,"1. Games are won by teams coordinating ganks/roams/TP advantage in the botlane because first tower gold, and botlane's tier 1 turret is weaker than other tier 1 turrets. Then they rotate and switch to top lane in an effort to secure towers as well. 

2. Most ADCs don't built too much crit as of lately with a few exceptions. The majority use on-hit items,  and items like deaths dance(which is broke) since they are a cheaper powerspike and are great against tanks. 

3. Mages are not weak at all. In fact control mages and burst mages are extremely strong right now that many of them such as Orianna, Syndra, and Taliyah are getting nerfs. Plus mages have very good itemization that can also counter tanks, with the only AD items noticeably better is giant slayer or executioner. 

4. Knight's Vow and Ardent censer is exactly why supports are a stronger role right now. They are the ones responsible for the increase in an AD's power/sustainability, and putting an AD in a higher light for another role's job is just unfair to the support role as that is they're contribution. ADCs now are highly dependent on play making or enchanter supports which is why Braum, thresh, and Janna are extremely good picks right now.

Misfits went to semis only because they played Splyce in the first round. Once top 4 steps up, these 2 will be far away again. 

In NA you have TSM, C9, DIG and Immortals who could all take 1st place, CLG who will probably remain strong despite kicking Dardoch, and Envy who can always suprise, thanks to a very solid bot lane, decent mid lane and Lira. All these 3 teams can end up in top 3. No team is a free win, Liquid improved, P1 despite slumping massively are still dangerous, Echo Fox and FlyQuest can always suprise, or put up a fight at the very least. 

I'm pretty sure that Misfits and Splyce would end up in the bottom 3 of NALCS, while the bottom tier NA teams should find themselves a place in playoffs in EU. I mean, P1 were 9th in league when they came to RR and they ended up 4:2, with their 2nd game vs FNC being thrown heavily. The money in NA did its job and while the top teams are still not ready to match Koreans, the league itself is finally looking strong. Every team has big names that are capable of winning games on their own from time to time. Overall, NALCS's strength is now much closer to LPL than to EULCS, thanks to how big the gap between mid and bottom tier teams is. ",leagueoflegends

also consider giving ryze a mana stacking like (veigar and nasus but on mana), i think it wouldn't be hard to balance him afterward &lt;3

47206,"Well, if you're better than every player in bronze then playing anything that can do a lot of damage will carry hardest.

If you're bronze or low silver skill level, then the best champs are going to be the easiest ones.  Ones with simple kits.  Yasuo, Lee Sin, Riven, etc are things a bronze player should not try to play.  Things like Garen, Annie, Darius are easier and can get more results with less skill requirement.

But the champion you're playing is way less important than being good in general.  Simple things like farming near perfectly will give you a huge advantage over bronze players.  

Combine decent farming, with an understanding of how to make trades in lane and managing/playing around your minion wave.  Having these basics down will make you a better laner than most people up until gold",leagueoflegends

47325,"Not to rain on your parade, but you can just turn back to the IMT or C9 games... Bjerg basically has his whole team in his lane for at least half the early-mid game. He didn't get 10 solo kills on Pobelter to get that ridiculous Syndra lead. And watch how many times Bio or Sven or Hauntzer (or combinations of them) will stop by his lane, camp a brush for 10 seconds or so, then Bjerg will act like he's roaming and join them, sit for another 10 seconds or so... It adds up.

Time is a resource as much as gold or minions are. To be fair to Bjerg he is *very* good at being worth the investment. But to say he gets few resources and completely discount the large amount of time his team spends huddling in his lane brushes for him is disingenuous. 

As to Huhi's laning, maybe I just picked the wrong games but I checked a couple TSM vs CLG matches and found that Bjerg and Huhi were trading 3-5 CS leads (in other words they were pretty much dead even). The only game Bjerg got a lead was when CLG shoved a big wave into the bot lane and were preparing a dive. Huhi and Bjerg both roamed down but Bjerg cleared the whole wave before CLG could dive. Before the dive Bjerg had a 1 wave advantage, after it was a bit over 2 waves.

Against Jensen Huhi did much worse in CS, falling about 30-40 behind but that was Huhi's ASol game where he was 5-1-2. Obviously roamed a ton, as usual. 2nd game as Vlad he was also down around 30 CS. It was about 15 CS at first (which I think is just the match up) then progressed to around 30 after he got killed. 3rd game he actually has about a 1 wave lead over Jensen's Syndra.

TLDR: Huhi's not as bad at laning as you may think or stats may suggest. He used to be a lot worse from what I remember but he's improved a ton. I'm guessing his CS numbers just get hurt pretty badly by his roam-heavy performances.",leagueoflegends

As for Sven and the outjungling, it's largely more of a team issue than an individual one, if you look at a lot of the plays Sven was making in Spring that were working, then failed at MSI, that are working now, it largely just that Bjerg's playing better now and they have more pressure from botside. I think Sven is definitely the weakest link on the team but the overall ""outjungling"" argument comes up pretty weak when the whole team was underperforming.  

As for Hauntzer vs Huni, we've seen the matchup like 20 times from back when Huni was in the NALCS so it's clear that Huni isn't drastically better than Hauntzer. He definitely outperformed him at MSI, but history, and his performances/benching that followed indicate to me that it was more of a momentary gap than the actual difference in their skill level.",leagueoflegends

49149,"You edited your post to include much more after i initially replied. That said:

&gt;She already got two buffs in a row that left people wondering what the hell she got them for since she was already fine, and you want a third one?

So it is a very tiny buff that is basically a quality of life improvement nothing more. She is fine as in ""not trash"". Orianna and syndra and multiple other champs literally do everything lux does 10 times better and are less reliant on your team not feeding and do not need everything to work out perfectly. They also have way more going for them. Both can dish out more damage in a fight especially more consistent damage because if you miss one q it only has a few second cooldown anyways so it's not a huge deal. If lux misses her skills in a fight it basically makes her useless due to her high cooldowns. You need to have everything work out perfectly to do the same shit that an orianna or syndra can do while missing half your stuff. There is a reason lux is a rare sight above gold elo and basically never seen above diamond 5. 


&gt;No, they can't. They use their main source of damage, while Lux keeps her binding and ultimate, and they still need to use 2-3 skills to clear a wave.
With what I said above, they definitely don't use less mana when they're using 2-3 skills.

Yes they absolutely can. Syndra with her first back around level 5 with lost chapter can twoshot caster minions with her q. Go try it out in practice tool. With 100 ap around level 9 (so midgame) she can oneshot them. Lux with lost chapter at level 5 leaves caster minions at half hp with one e so you need to all auto them once. At the same ap as syndra at level 9 at the same time she leaves the caster minions at this super annoying 5 hp status that i talked about in my post. You will never have to use more than 2 qs with syndra or ziggs to kill casters. And even when you use 2 q's they still cost less mana and are faster than lux e. As soon as you get a decent amount of ap with syndra or ziggs you will always oneshot the caster minions with a q. With lux this often is not the case even when you already have morellos. Also you say they use their main source of damage while lux doesn't. Syndra and ziggs both use only q, both have very short cd. They both still have w, e and ult which all do a lot of damage. Lux is left with q (which doesn't do a lot of damage early on and his really high cd) and ult which is difficult to hit without q. 


&gt;Not exclusive to Lux, so why should she get something because when literally every other champion in the game, according to you, shouldn't?

I didn't necessarily say no other champ should get this treatment but i am not aware of any where it is this annoying. At least not the ones that fill the same role as her.


&gt;Oh yeah, let's give a third undeserved buff to a champion that's already between fine and strong.
As I mentioned before, people were already wondering why she got a needless buff, much less a second. Both buffs ended up being assumed by many to be to jack up Elementalist Lux sales.

I am not really gonna repeat myself here. Lux is outclassed in her role by several other champs that do everything she does better. That is fact. A small buff like this would not be unjustified nor would it break her balancing.

In the context ""Jensen is Westbrook to Bjerg's LBJ"", it's not about who's deserving of winning the MVP trophy this year (yes, I do understand the poster above then had a paragraph talking specifically about how he thought Westbrook was ""underserving"" of MVP,  I'm in your camp -- Westbrook was MVP). 

However, this was not the original point to the analogy/comparison of Jensen/Westbrook to Bjerg/LeBron. LeBron is one of the best players of all time; who statistically improves during playoff games (I don't want to get into regular season coasting arguments or LBJ clutch arguments -- something that is undeniable is his PER and counting stats go up in the playoffs) and cares more about team accolades/championships over personal accolades/MVP, DPY, point leader etc. Bjergsen is at the same stage -- he's earned the individual accolades, so he's realized teams accolades are the next level. It's why TSM fans complain when he picks Galio or Karma over Syndra.

Westbrook and Jensen arent undisputed the best, and so personal accolades mean more. It doesn't mean they don't deserve them -- it just means they care and try harder than the people were comparing them to. Why do they try harder? Because people still doubt them as individuals, and it's very hard to perform as a team when you're always looking over your shoulder and under critique for your individual plays. 

Yet they are considered MVPs. It's just that you're comparing them to arguably the best player of their generation, and players who are at a different part of their career path. You can be the most valuable player, in the sense that you bring the most value to your team, but not win the team goals. Some people weight these accolades differently.",leagueoflegends

So open up the Device Manager program on windows and go to Mice and other pointing devices and disable any that arent your actual mouse. Also do the same under the keyboards section.

This fixed it for me.

If this doesnt work, the best thing i can suggest (which i did on my old pc) is to download a mouse control setup program (google) and bind your mouse button 4/5 to a key you dont use in lol, like brackets or something. Then in game instead of selecting mouse button 4/5 you select brackets and lol thinks you are pressing bracket, but you are pressing mouse button 4 and the program is converting that to brackets.

Because bundes in games, specifically League, have set a standard of always being sale priced skins in a big bunch.

They know people would even pay more than usual for the bundle because team skin sets are like that and such a focus was put on this year's skins.

I think I failed to mention in this post, but on AD champs I run hp/level yellows due to lack of better options (dodge is random and a lot weaker with the quickness mastery from defense, mana regen is generally unneeded (and can be obtained from blues if you want) and flat armour is relatively bad for a carry that should be positioned/protected to avoid focussed damage).

These not only provide a bit of a late game buffer against incidental aoe but also mean you have 5 bars at level 1, allowing you to use your quints for movespeed or armour pen (I go armour pen myself, quints+reds+masteries gives 31 total which is good all game and, as you quite rightly mention, is huge early game. Plus since I generally get phantom dancer (with zeal around the start of mid game with early farm) the movement speed is less essential).

With AP champs this isn't really an option since you need the blues for flat CDR and get your mana regen from your yellows, so the only option left for early hp is the quints.

So yeh, I don't run with 4bars at level 1 on any champ (except support, I've recently started trying gold/10 quints on those, but I don't suggest rushing to get those unless you also have far, far too many runes and champs to need your IP for anything more important ;), it's just that AD allows you other ways to get that early health that AP can't afford to use...",leagueoflegends

This means that by the time this change rolls around, I'd have forgone a lot of enjoyment from playing a variety of champions because I had to take care of the runes first. Normally, this would be fine since the people who bought champs instead wouldn't be able to enjoy them as much since their runes are probably generic AD/AP pages. However, since these guys would get runes for free (which I spent IP on) it should be fair that I get the same sort of compensation, right? 

and yes, I like having right runes on champions. It irks me when I have MR runes against a full-AD team. Or when I don't have MR against a mostly-AP team. 

Of course, I'm speaking from the perspective of me now, who just spent 3 weeks grinding so he can buy all the necessary runes and a runepage for lee sin (which I still suck at). It's true that once this change rolls around, I probably won't care anymore. I still wish for a compensation tho, probably a skin or something. That'd be nice. 

Also, I think you're speaking from the perspective of someone who already has all champions. Since that means IP is useless for you. Could be wrong, though, and you're just annoyed by people complaining about something as trivial as IP. (which you shouldn't be.

Personally, I don't consider Nashor's a core on anybody. It's a horribly expensive item... you can consider it as a last luxury item, but rushing it just isn't worth it. 

There's 2 build orders that I like to build, depending on the lane match-up (Kayle can easily take a solo lane, and she should do so, in order to maximize her farm... putting her bottom with an AD carry is such a sin)

**#1:**
If I'm laning versus a ranged champion I like getting a philo stone+boots ASAP and then rush a Sheen, because, chances are, your enemy will have a snare/slow/stun and you really want to do some damage to him, either to try and zone him out, or lower his HP so he can be ganked more easily, and this is what Sheen helps with, it gives you a bit of burst in 1-2 attacks. After the Sheen I build a Deathcap, and then try to farm for a lichbane. The core items here are Sheen+Deathcap, it gives you great burst damage, and a good heal.

**#2:**
The second build is for when I lane against a melee champion. Core items are Rageblade+Shen. Cheaper core build, very effective against melee champions cause you'll want to trade blows with them more often than not and Sheen+Deathcap just doesn't give you that. I'm still sort of experimenting on her builds, and I'm trying to find a place for the Gunblade somewhere in it.... Rageblade+Cutlass+Sheen might be worth a try.

I reckon in low/mid elo, maybe even high plat/low diamond where i am, you might just be able to get away with it, but i think its going to be much rarer high plat plus, because of how his kit is.

63174,"Q resets your attack counter so use it immediately after an attack.

W reduces cooldowns, so use it when you can to reduce the cooldown on your ult. You also have to choose whether to use it before or after Q depending on the situation. If you **really* need burst damage, use it before hand to get the knockup ASAP. Otherwise, use it afterwards for the CDR. You actually have to use it after the knockup to get CDR on your Q.

When trying to gank someone, use your E after they try to escape instead of beginning with it. Unless they're really low on health they'll probably try to fight a bit before running. It also slows enemies near the target you hit so if the enemy is just out of your range, you can use it on a nearbye minion to slow them and catch up. 

Your R damages for a percentage of enemy health which makes it kinda complicated. If you use your E to rush initiate a team fight and use your R you'll do a lot of damage but you'll probably die. If you wait to use it, it won't do as much damage. Depends on your build and team comp.

Unlike most AD/AS champions, Xin hao actually benefits more from AS then AD most of the time due to his passive, Q and E. Don't forget to build *some* AD on him though. Also, AS caps out at 2.5, so with your W you'll want to stop before 2. On the subject of Items, I've also found that ionian boots or merc boots help out a lot more then berserker greaves. I also like to start with a longsword and healthpot instead of a dagger since the extra AS won't help out much in the beginning. Having a ton of AS also makes Maerads Bloodrazor a great item.

Xin Zhao is a decent jungler, but there are far betters. I feel like his ability to get ganks sort of makes up for it though.

Early game, don't be too eager to rush in and kill people.

For skill order, I go R&gt;Q&gt;W&gt;E. I usually start off with an E though to make sure I can complete ganks.

Xin Zhao can either be a great melee DPS or a great tank. Pick one and go with it.

she just doesnt really do much. the only thing she is like good at is clearing the jungle somewhat fast (but thats not even that good anymore because powerfarming got nerfed with the s7 jungle spawntimer change . well and krugs suck)

she has a useless passive and its design is very bad. its kinda like kindred where you are not guaranteed to get stacks but in shyvanas case she atleast doesnt need them (i dont think changing her passive to give like bonuses for dragon kills is a good idea either some ppl have suggested it. you are not guaranteed to get drakes and you even if you get some you dont always get useful ones. sometimes you just cant afford going for drake)

her q is .. well its a bit of dmg (got nerfed at some point so unless you put points in it sucks)

w is like her only good spell. deals quite ok aoe dmg. clears waves/jungle camps and also gives her a speedboost

her e is meh. like ok you get dmg on auto attacks but you arent actually that good at sticking to a target because no cc (while the duration of the debuff actually isnt that long). and tbh its just a really lame ability. you are a half dragon and what can you do? yea spit a little flame ... woooh

and her ult is well. probably the worst engage type ult in the game. you jump into the enemy team (until like a few months ago you could even get cced out of it) and do a little knockback ... also grants small bonus effects to your other abilities which are like ok but not really that noticable. you dont really become much stronger in ult form

ever since shyvanas base dmg got nerfed back when she was played to lane she was pretty mediocre (yes she worked with feral flare/devourer vs ppl that didnt know how to play) you cant build her super tanky anymore because ppl will just ignore you since your dmg isnt actually that good and you dont have cc. if you decide to build some dmg you will be pretty squishy and since shyv gets kited so easily you will probably just die without really accomplishing anything

i think a full rework would be the best for shyvana. unless you overtune her numbers she doesnt really work atm. like why would you pick her? dmg? others can do a lot of dmg and more reliable. tankyness? other champs are tankier with ok dmg and way more cc. jungle clear? yea camps respawn pretty slow so you dont need to clear that fast and there are enough champs that can clear fast while still having better ganks",leagueoflegends

66419,"People shouldn't conflate ""best player"" with ""deserving of MVP"". And stats don't tell the whole story for either title. Jensen would have my MVP vote over Bjergsen because if you take both of them out of their team, TSM would probably still be a top 3 team and C9 would very likely struggle to stay in the top half of the table. Jensen has been carrying C9 this split, with a little bit of help from Contractz. Bjergsen has always been a clutch player and a rock in the mid lane for TSM, but the other 4 players on TSM are doing well this split and Bjergsen isn't solo carrying TSM on his back.

However, Bjergsen is in my opinion, a better player than Jensen, especially when you start looking at his consistency and non-laning factors like shot calling, clutch moments, leadership within the team, etc. I think as laners, they are probably fairly even and you'd get some sort of 50-50 record if you made them play a bunch of laning phase against each other.",leagueoflegends

But in reality, it’s a mix. I think every NA fan is surprised at how poorly EU is doing, and I’m not sure whether it’s them slumping or everyone underrating NA as a region. I do think that P1 have figured out their team though, that the 3-2 record isn’t a fluke and that they’ll reach playoffs. They should keep going being a fairly strong team and I think that this experience should improve their abilities.

Your 100/83.33 has no meaning. They are not taking 83.33% damage, they are not mitigating 83.33% damage. What you are showing is that if they went from taking 83.33 (equivalent to a flat 16.67% dmg reduction) damage to taking 100 damage, they would be taking 20% more damage.

Fnatic, G2 and Misfits seem pretty organised (UoL too, to a lesser extent) but many of the LCS teams don't have much in the way of structure or investment - they just live split-to-split, and when someone gets an offer from a better side, or starts playing like shit or whatever, the teams gets relegated and the org disappears.

The NA scene hasn't just got stronger by itself - it's got stronger because even low-end orgs can afford to spend big cash on player salaries or team houses or analysts or whatever. It wasn't that long ago that the NA challenger scene was a total joke, where a bunch of has-been rejects from EU (Krepo, Snoopeh, Yellowpete) were able to go to NA and get straight into LCS when they wouldn't have even been offered a starting spot on most EU challenger rosters at the time.

But now NA challenger has tons of well-funded orgs that can afford to bring in pros like Fox/Gillius, fail, then try again with Dandy/GBM. That's not something anyone in EU except Fnatic/G2/Misfits can really afford, but in NA there are 10+ teams that have that sort of financial stability.",leagueoflegends

Lux just oneshots if she hits a Q but if you spam E on her you'll run out of mana pretty easily (130 mana at max rank can be really punishing).

I think you're are thinking I just want to get buffs while all of the lanes are getting pushed. That is not the case at all. If all MY team members are pushing then I will get a buff.

I will bend backwards to help my lanes out, but if they do stupid things and do suicidal things, do not expect me to immediately leave my place to walk to the other side of the map, 40 seconds ago you were full health using all your skills to farm the wave, of course you are at the tower.
