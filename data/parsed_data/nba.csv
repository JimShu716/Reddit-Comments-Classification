2047,"No offense but shit, motherfuckers forgot how good pre-knee injury Kidd was...and even post-injury Kidd was bonkers for a few years.

You gotta keep in mind that Lebron's ability to finish makes the passing lanes that much wider- everyone knew Kidd was going to pass and he still led the league in assists (or was top 3) for pretty much a decade.  It's the same way MJ was able to average a near triple double that year he tried to play PG kinda, even though he clearly wasn't the level of passer his assist totals might make it seem.  When you're a scorer at the level of MJ, passing lanes might literally be two or three times as wide as those that a guy like Kidd might get due to the difference in the defense's focus.

If anything, I compare Kidd to Westbrook, except with Rubio's brain.  The dude was the best rebounding guard of all time even without his team feeding them to him and was Magic-esque on the fast break.

In my book, Kidd is up there with Nash and Magic and Stockton and CP3 (and some guys today like Huertas or Teodisic or Rubio who are on their level as passers but are so lacking in other areas that they can't take advantage, the fact that they're all Euros is coincidence) with guys like Bird, Lebron and even natural points like Isaiah on a tier just below.",nba

5006,"There is loyalty in the NBA but there's a lot of factors in play where you can't use one factor in determining what is and isn't loyalty. I think it's all situational. I'm a Celtics fan and I'm not happy Bradley is gone. However, even before the draft, everyone knew he was too good to keep at a price the Celtics could afford while trying to improve with free agents. So getting something for Bradley instead of losing him in free agency next year makes perfect sense. That's the smartest thing to do in this case. I doubt they wanted to just outright part with Bradley because he was such a great player all around.

I think you can play the no loyalty card when a star player leaves after being offered a good contract to stay on a contending team. Ray Allen was a good example of this. We had everyone back from the previous year and he left for the Heat over, if I remember correctly, 2 million and 1 year difference during talks. We offered either the more money or the extra year. Again, Celtics fan, that's just an example that comes to my mind.

The Jazz, a few years ago, let Hayward try to find a better contract than he was asking for because they didn't think he was worth what he asked. When he couldn't find better they got him at what they wanted. If a team was willing to bet on you going to market, how can you blame him for wanting to go somewhere where the coach, team and fans really wanted him and are obviously giving a max contract? I know, another Celtics example, but I think it's still relevant and topical in this discussion.

Lastly, Paul Pierce. My favorite player. Love that guy. So sad to see him traded but again, it wasn't about loyalty. Pierce was not going to contribute the same way he always had and KG was getting injury prone. We were not getting better and we would only get worse going forward. Ainge traded them when he saw he could fleece the Nets big time. With their exit, we just got a great player in the draft and possibly more in the years to come because of that trade. It gave us something instead of nothing had we held on to Pierce and KG and just sucked or stayed average for multiple seasons. Pierce and KG still love Boston and Boston still loves them. Ainge talked with Pierce about the trade and Pierce had to convince KG it was OK and made sense because I think he had a no trade clause.

At the end of the day I think players should try and get the most for themselves in terms of money and success (NOT just money) and so should the teams themselves. Taking paycuts to stay with your team is obviously loyalty. Leaving a good team for a max contract to go to a shit team going nowhere, is more over the line of not being loyal and just being greedy. Yes I know sports players have a short career and should try to get the most money but I mean millions of dollars is  reasonable for any human being to live off of.",nba
5022,"I understand disliking the Heat because they were arrogant. 

Duncan was very close to leaving for Orlando. Weird that he gets a pass because the coin flip landed on tails instead of heads. And the way you wrote it makes Duncan sound selfish (which I don't think he is). But Duncan taking pay cuts (along with Ginobili and Parker) was really unfair. A lot of teams were forced to pay the Joe Johnsons of the world an absurd amount that crippled their chance of building a true contender. So to me it is just another way of cheating the system. 

How Shaq gets a pass is beyond me though. I guarantee you Shaq believed he was going to win titles in LA before he signed. So it is not like he thought he was choosing between money and winning. Fans have a weird way to look at things very subjectively and only like things that ""fit"" the way they like it. ",nba

Stretch 4, preferably quick feet and can switch on D.

Athletic 5 that can protect the rim, rebound and run the floor.

Heat-check 6th man, someone who can score and handle (Lou Will, Eric Gordon etc.)

Decent role player bench guys, each with high energy and one really good skill for certain matchups.

Obviously though for a ""perfect team"", you'd need some superstar talent in there somehow, I'd favor a great wing that can handle the ball and score (LeBron/KD/Kawhi etc.)

Edit - Rough idea for team would be one of these options for each position....

PG - Conley / Dragic

SG - Middleton / Bradley

SF - Ariza / Crowder / Covington

PF - Markieff / Porzingis / H. Barnes

C - Gobert / Turner / C. Zeller

&gt; Saying Jordan didn't play anyone in the Finals as good as the '14 Spurs isn't even that controversial. Every team coming out of the West since 2012 is better than any team Jordan met in the Finals.

""[Jordan's] opponents were all weak!""

&gt; The only team back then that was stacked similarly to the superteams of today was Jordan's own team.

""Jordan's teams were unfairly stacked!""

&gt; The times are just different now and teams need more to win now than they did then.

""LeBron's... always faced historic superteams!""

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; And I'm well aware who Jordan played in the Finals.

* I kinda doubt that, or you wouldn't make blanket statements about every team from the West 2012 and on has been better than them. and would respond to the Sonics and Jazz with smthg more substantive than ""but muh Hawks""

* those Hawks were crippled in the playoffs. a 60 win team with historic attributes (all-time D, HOF players) making the Finals means something. and shouldn't be off-handedly dismissed as weaker than any of the 5 Finals opponents LeBron lost to.

&amp;nbsp;

* counting rings and Finals is stupid. except when his 8 Finals and 7 straight are LeBron's greatest achievement, and the central reason this GOAT talk is happening in the first place

* and rings do make a HUGE difference when considering the huge asymmetry of the conferences. when your path to the Finals is thru smthg like the 5th, 8th, and 16th best teams, it matters when you consistently lose to the one top 4 team you face.

Warriors draft a mid-lottery, late-lottery, and second round pick who become perennial MVP candidates, all-NBA and one of the best shooters of all time, and perennial DPOY.  And all in a time frame where they can play together (vs say when Toronto had Vince and then drafted Bosh).

OKC had three top 4 picks in four years (Durant, Westbrook, Harden) and a late first in Ibaka. Three MVP candidates and a former first team all-defensive player and league blocks leader.

Houston is the other one. Timing of Harden extension, one of the few teams with the cap situation and assets able to make the trade at the time, and Harden turning into a better player than anyone expected, MVP candidate.

As the official trade guru of the NBA, Adam Silver has bequeathed (is that a word?) me the responsibility of creating blockbuster trades to reach his goal of making the offseason considerably more interesting than the regular season and playoffs. 

In response, I've laid out the following scenarios: 

[**Trade #1**](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=yccjd8t2)

**NEW YORK KNICKS**

*sends:* Carmelo Anthony

*receives:* Jaylen Brown, Terry Rozier, Tyler Zeller

*why they do it?* as it is, they are considering buying out Carmelo-- receiving Brown + Rozier is a far superior option

**CLEVELAND CAVALIERS**

*sends:* Kevin Love, Eddy Tavares

*receives:* Ryan Anderson, Avery Bradley

*why they do it?* Anderson gives them 85% of Love's production, without sacrificing long-range shooting. Bradley gives them an elite defender and solid shooter.

**HOUSTON ROCKETS**

*sends:* Ryan Anderson, Clint Capela

*receives:* Kevin Love, Eddy Tavares

*why they do it:* Houston knows it takes stars to win in the NBA. This gives them a terrific trio of CP3/Harden/Love. 

**BOSTON CELTICS**

*sends:* Jaylen Brown, Terry Rozier, Tyler Zeller

*receives:* Carmelo Anthony, Clint Capela 

*why they do it:* Avery Bradley is a valuable player and Jaylen Brown has great potential, but Carmelo is precisely the #1 scoring option they need to take Boston over the hump. Capela is a very solid big who lessens the pain of losing two young players. 

__________________________________________________

[**Trade #2**](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=y76sq2qx)

**NEW ORLEANS**

*sends:* Omer Asik, Demarcus Cousins

*receives:* Zach Collins, Mo Harkless

*why they do it*: Cousins and Brow isn't an ideal fit, and Asik may have the worst contract in the league. This sheds them of the Asik contract, nets a high upside big in Collins, and an upside wing in Harkless.

**PORTLAND**

*sends:* Zach Collins, Meyers Leonard, Mo Harkless, Ed Davis

*receives:* Demarcus Cousins, Jerryd Bayless

*why they do it*: Lillard-McCollum-Cousins

**PHILADELPHIA**

*sends:* Jahlil Okafor, Jerryd Bayles

*receives:* Meyers Leonard, Jeremy Lin

*why they do it*: Okafor's value has diminished significantly and his style doesn't mesh with the core-4. This nets them a complimentary young big in Meyers, and a much-needed veteran presence in Lin

**BROOKLYN**

*sends:* Jeremy Lin

*receives:* Jahlil Okafor, Omer Asik, Ed Davis

*why they do it:* Brooklyn's best move is to take on bad contracts in order to get young assets. Okafor still has star potential (think Al Jefferson) and DeAngelo Russell + Jahlil Okafor makes their young core somewhat intriguing. 

_________________________________________________________

[**Trade #3**](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=ycuqs8ov)

**PORTLAND**

*sends:* Noah Vonleh, Zach Collins, Allan Crabbe

*receives:* Kevin Love

*why they do it:* they acquire a legitimate star player in Love to pair with their excellent guard duo-- without giving up any needle-moving pieces (unless Collins develops into a star)

**NEW YORK**

*sends:* Carmelo Anthony

*receives:* Zach Collins, Noah Vonleh, Allan Crabbe

*why they do it: *The Knicks are in re-build mode, and losing Carmelo without a return of young talent is ill-advised. This nets them three young players with solid potential. 

**CLEVELAND**

*sends:* Kevin Love

*receives:* Carmelo Anthony

*why they do it:* Love is a bit younger than Anthony-- but a less potent scorer-- and Melo is good friends with Lebron, and makes a terrific trio with Kyrie and LBJ. Certainly a win-now move. 

_______________________________

[**Trade #4**](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=y7acvc3k)

A variation on Trade 3, with more incentive for Cleveland.

**PORTLAND**

*sends:* Noah Vonleh, Zach Collins, Allan Crabbe

*receives:* Kevin Love, Edy Tavares

*why they do it:* they acquire a legitimate start player in Love to pair with their excellent guard duo-- without giving up any needle-moving pieces (unless Collins develops into a star)

**NEW YORK**

*sends:* Carmelo Anthony

*receives:* Zach Collins, Allan Crabbe

*why they do it:* The Knicks are in re-build mode, and losing Carmelo without a return of young talent is ill-advised. This nets them two young players with solid potential. 

**CLEVELAND**

*sends:* Kevin Love, Edy Tavares

*receives:* Carmelo Anthony, Ryan Anderson

*why they do it:* Carmelo forms a potent offensive trio with Kyrie and Lebron, while Anderson lessens the blow of losing Love's stretch-4 shooting ability. 

**HOUSTON**

*sends:* Ryan Anderson

*receives:* Noah Vonleh, JR Smith

*why they do it:* sheds them of Anderson's contract, opening roster flexibility. Ads a great 6th man (Smith) at a cheaper cost and shorter contract (than Anderson). 

__________________________________________________________

[**Trade #5**](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=ybwex42w)

**BOSTON**

*sends:* Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Jordan Mickey, Tyler Zeller

*receives:* Kevin Love, Clint Capela

*why they do it:* Brown and Smart are tough to give up, but for Love+Capela it's worth the risk. The move gives Boston a starting 5 of: 

Thomas-Bradley-Crowder-Love-Horford with Tatum+Capela off the bench.

**CLEVELAND**

*sends:* Kevin Love

*receives:* Ryan Anderson, Marcus Smart

*why they do it:* With Bron+Kyrie, Love's skills cannot be properly utilized in Cleveland. This move gets them a knock-down shooter and a gritty, merciless defender.  

**HOUSTON**

*sends:* Ryan Anderson, Clint Capela

*receives:* Carmelo Anthony

*why they do it:* Morey strikes again! Paul/Harden/Melo trio can go toe-to-toe with any other three. 

**NEW YORK**

*sends:* Carmelo Anthony

*receives:* Jaylen Brown, Tyler Zeller, Jordan Mickey

*why they do it:* Hmm... buy out  Carmelo and get nothing for him? Or take on Zellers contract and get Jaylen Brown's terrific potential to pair with Porzingis? ",nba

Essentially the benefit to killing an old animal is in the money it raises to help further conservation. Wouldn't it be best if we didn't kill the animal and raised money other ways?

Not much IMO especially considering the West just got even tougher with Minnesota, Denver, OKC, and Houston improving. Spurs are still the Spurs. Same with GSW.

2) Hayward goes to Boston. If Boston was already as good as Utah without Hayward aren't they significantly better than Utah with Hayward (comparing them to Utah with Hayward still).

27184,"Ok lets take a look at this article you provided

&gt;Women who are virgins when they marry are less likely to divorce within five years than those who have multiple partners before marriage. Next least likely to divorce are those who had one premarital partner.

Ok exactly what i've been saying

&gt;Women who had two sex partners prior to marriage have consistently had higher divorce rates within five years even than those with higher numbers of partners. People with two premarital partners are more likely to divorce than those with three to nine. Only recently has the divorce rate been highest among women with 10 or more premarital partners than among those who had two.

&gt;But the difference is so slight it's not statistically significant

The difference between two and 10+ is not statistically significant which was surprising to the researcher. Not disputing that and he even gives an explanation, which I also hypothesized earlier in this comment thread. 

This is NOT saying there is no statistical difference between those with 3, 4, 5 to 10+. Only that 2 and 10+ are statistically similar in this study.  

&gt;He theorized it's the case of the one who got away. Presumably, the woman married one of her two premarital partners, but the other creates ""an over-emphasized comparison. It's like in historical romance novels where the woman is agonizing between two suitors. That second one is a viable option.""

50% chance that the guy you married is the worst person you've had sex with. 

&gt;Other research has shown that premarital sex impacts marital quality.

&gt;""Our findings were quite in line with what (Wolfinger's) study found. The number of sexual partners someone had had before marriage was associated with marital quality and a higher number is associated with lower quality across the first two years,"" said Galena K. Rhoades, 

Exactly what I've been saying.

&gt; Caucasian and black women were similar in terms of their sexual behaviors prior to marriage. Hispanics and ""others"" had ""notably fewer"" sex partners and also lower divorce rates than whites or blacks. 

Hispanics and Asains have lower sexual parners and lower divorce rates. 

&gt;Since 2000, one-third of marriages involving women who had 10 or more premarital partners end in divorce within five years, the report said, but Wolfinger added a caveat. ""This is the result most readers of this brief expected: A lot of partners mean a lot of baggage, which makes a stable marriage less tenable. It's also entirely likely that the correlation is spurious, the product of certain personal characteristics. For example, people who suffered childhood sexual abuse are more likely to have extensive sexual histories,"" he wrote. ""Childhood abuse also increases the odds of a problematic marriage.""

Pretty much in line with what i've been saying. You can't say that hooking up with 10 people is the reason for higher marriage failures, but the fact is 10+ is shown to have the highest divorce rates. Whether that be because of religious factors, morals, sexual abuse it doesn't matter.

2. They had a logjam of guys playing the 4/5.  Signing/trading for Biyombo, Ibaka, Jeff Green, and the emergence of Aaron Gordon left fewer minutes and limited spacing for him to do his thing in the post.  You can see last year he started to shoot the 3 (which isn't his game).

3. Sometimes guys just get to a certain point and don't develop any further.  Not everyone is going to get to the next level.  Vucevic has his glaring weaknesses: lack of range and no defense.  If he can develop a 3 point shot, he can progress to another level but I don't see him becoming a decent defender anytime soon.

I wish our news media had better ethics and reported things thoroughly and objectively, but dismissing entire sources is foolish, imo.

When the pivot foot comes off the ground or if it comes off the ground while making the second step, the player has to get rid of the ball before the pivot foot touches the ground again.

in all seriousness, I personally was calling those Lakers teams ""stacked"" back in 2009/10 - so it is not revisionist history. That buzzword gets thrown around way too much.

LO was an absolute matchup nightmare for opposing teams that would go on to be a 6MOTY award winner not long after that year. Gasol was the A1 sidekick Kobe needed to put him over the top, he was an All-NBA player and a bonafide superstar. 

Bynum was probably the best young center in the league at the time (aside from Apex Dwight Howard) and combined with LO and Gasol gave the Lakers some stupid length that teams just couldn't fuck with at the time. He was oft injured but when healthy he was an X-Factor.

They weren't ""stacked"" by today's superteam (GSW/Heatles) standards, but at the time? They were stacked. The best (or 2nd best, depending on personal opinion) player in the world + All-NBA player + 6MOTY forward + Bynum was a very, very good team. 

Analysts are wrong about many things, I would posit that the back-to-back champion Lakers teams having the worst supporting cast in recent history falls into that ""they were wrong"" category.

But the beat kicks in and I'm simply to weak. I reach down and rip the tape off of my pussy, freeing it and allowing it pop as it was always meant to. The album continues on and, exposed for the Lorde slut I really am, I begin twerking, even though that trend died in 2015. ""Why are you doing this?"" I sob, tears pouring down my cheeks.
""Oh, don't be so,"" she whispers, leaning in so close that, even through all the pussy poppery, I can feel her breath on my ear, ""melodramatic.""

She rips all three of my wigs off in one snatch and then takes out a briefcase. She reaches inside and reveals a small perfume bottle. It's only now, distracted as I was with all the twerking and pussy popping, that I notice there is a camera filming me and Lorde. We're in a perfume commercial.

Lorde hikes my leg up and sticks the bottle inside of me. She then pulls it out and puts a label on it. ""Essence of /u/wonderbitch26's Pussy Poppery.""

""No, please,"" I beg. ""Don't expose me like this. Think of my mother.""

But Lorde has no pity. She just poses for the camera, showcasing my pussy essence for the world to see. She sticks my wigs and pussy poppery in her briefcase where I catch a glimpse of similar wigs and vials. I'm not her first victim.

41809,"I just don't think it's a ""much better fit"". I get that Teague is a better 3pt shooter but he's not honestly that good himself (~35% iirc) compared to the other FA guards out there. And he's a notable step down defensively and from a floor general/passing standpoint. Rubio has ways of making an offense click even if he's inefficient as a scorer (just look at offensive numbers with and without him for the pups over the last few years). Teague will not help others in the same way that Ricky could. It might be a slightly better fit but Teague is also significantly more expensive and Ricky has also been nothing but a consummate professional and teammate (I don't know Teague that well aside from his on-court accolades so I can't say either way with regards to him). So overall from a basketball standpoint, I think it's at best a lateral move at best but it required sending away a fan favorite and paying a lot more to get a middling 1st round pick at best. I know shooting is of high importance on this team considering the rest of the roster but I just don't like the move all things considered.

45482,"&gt; Second, looking back, literally zero question that Lebron was the best player on that Miami team. At first, people pretended Wade was comparable, but after a while it became insanely apparent that Lebron was the best. 

People weren't pretending. LeBron was better but Wade was a top 5 player in his own right(probably top 3) .  The hype and expectations surrounding the Heat during that initial summer were very similar to the hype surrounding Golden State when they signed Durant(as in a top 5 player joining another top 5 player in their prime during FA). 
 
The thing is, absolutely no one expected Wade to decline as rapidly as he did following 2011. And you are absolutely right that this in fact did help LeBron's legacy because after that year, there was no longer any doubt as to whose team it was - hence him not really getting as much hate for playing with Miami as he did at the time of the decision. 

If Curry suddenly began to decline next season and Golden State officially became Durant's team, that wouldn't make people retroactively incorrect about questioning whose team it was from the initial signing up until now. ",nba

46844,"Absolutely. You are correct that Porzingis is a better 3-pt shooter. Personally, I believe sometimes stats should be used to mislead if the overall point is valid. In this case, I mainly want to portray how Aldridge is in fact good offensively (despite his recent WCF performance) and similar to Porzingis despite public opinion having turned against him during the playoffs.

That being said, I actually do agree with you that Porzingis is offensively on par and honestly was more impactful than Aldridge last season. They're certainly very close in terms of prodcution.

I also agree that KP is a good rim protector and an excellent shot blocker (one of the league's best lol). However, when he steps out to the perimeter his slow foot speed (not relative to size but to the league in general) and overall awkwardness makes him an easy guy to blow by when he gets switched out there ([old clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVIlUedp-Tw)). Even with a bit of added weight this season, LMA is much more comfortable stepping out to shadow a guy before the rest of the defense recovers. He also plays within the defensive scheme well and can reliably rim protect when needed (though Pau does that most of the time). I just think Porzingis seems like he's trying to emulate Gobert without the same polish and skills, whereas LMA is closer to a Paul Millsap type of versatile defender who can play weak side shot blocker. Imo, the latter is much more rare and valuable in the NBA today. There are plenty of bootleg Goberts to go around the league; hell, even Pau was a pretty solid rim protector if you go buy the numbers. For that reason, I see KP as being good at a easily replaceable skill, and LMA as being very good at a less easily replaceable skill. To me, that's a huge difference and is why I think LMA is better than KP and even Kevin Love. 

With all that being said, KP is a beast and will almost certainly be better next year playing in an actual offensive scheme. But for this past year only, it's LMA.",nba

50005,"The Knicks continue to stall a trade from happening, the worst they will come out of this. 

First off, they are in this situation because of their own doing. They gave Melo his NTC and trade kicker. They spent the last year or so completely trashing Melo in the media, trying tempt him to waive his NTC. They were the ones saying that they are ""motivated"" to move Melo and now they are chickening out. 

Even though most of the trashing of Melo was Phil's doing, the Knicks' higher ups and Dolan did not do anything to stop it or even show Melo some support. 

Now as they continue to stall in a trade, they are stuck because Melo still has his NTC that he is only willing to waive for 2 teams and his trade value is only going to decrease at this point. 

Holding on to Melo is something that they can do but they'll look even more pathetic around the league, especially if Melo continues to voice his displeasure. Melo is still one of the most connected/well liked players in the league with almost every big name star and agent close with him. The message of how incompetent the Knicks are treating their star player won't go unnoticed in this league. 

Having Melo there for even a season will cause a constant distraction for the Knicks that no team wants. 

The Knicks are hoping Melo will opt out next year but that's no guarantee.  As a 34 year old, he could go the D-Wade route and opt in. He'll have almost 28M reasons to opt in.  Do they really want to waste 2 seasons of this?  

Finally, they are risking alienating their franchise cornerstone to be, Porzingis. He didn't go to his exit meeting in support of Melo and it looks like he is avoiding the Knicks at all cost this offseason, even after the firing of Phil. That's definitely not a good look and very telling that he will probably bounce the first chance he gets unless something changes. 

I get the Knicks want at least something good in return for Melo but they have completely fumbled this whole situation and are looking even more incompetent with each passing day.  People around the NBA are taking note. Not saying the should straight up trade Melo for Anderson but if there's a deal on the table that they can feel at least a little bit tolerable, they need to jump on it and finish this correctly. The longer they wait, the less likely they'll get anything tolerable. ",nba

54553,"What the techniques behind RAPM/RPM would help you understand is a player's net impact on his team's AST% differential, because that's exactly what they currently do for a player's net impact on his team's point differential.

You actually likely would want to adjust the technique to no longer consider the opposing team (making it simpler) in this case now that I think of it, because certainly the AST% of the opposing team is irrelevant to your team.

You're gonna just need to read up on how RAPM is calculated if you want more answers because I truly don't feel like explaining it in depth, and there are probably pages out there that would do a better job than me anyhow. What I have tried to explain to you very clearly is what it does, if not necessarily all of the details on how.

&gt;You haven't given me shred of evidence that ""off"" assist percentages can be found using RPM... 

That's because strictly speaking they're NOT. That's kind of the whole point, right? I'm saying raw off assist percentages are highly flawed and that the techniques behind RPM/RAPM offer a better way to solve the same fundamental question. But the entire point is that they aren't the same. They just address the same question.

&gt;We are looking for how a team moves the ball without their star player, RPM and RAPM nor their methods would help us in that regard. 

They certainly would, by telling us how star players impact AST% in general.

&gt;So why should we suddenly use RPM? (Which is impossible to do) 

It's not impossible to use the techniques of RAPM. I do believe RPM is proprietary so yes, that would be impossible. We should use it because it's better and on/off is deeply flawed. I'm blue in the face with explaining that by now.",nba

It's cause he didn't have the play making of Bosh &amp; Wade (who, in their Primes are better than Kyrie &amp; Love, primarily because both are smarter offensive guys &amp; significantly better defenders). He's lost a little athleticism (but is still significantly more athletic than most), but is a way better scorer now.  I mean, against one of the best teams of all time, he still had a next positive of +12 in the series (iirc).  

My fantasy is to see him play with a legendary experienced coach before he retires (like Pop or someone). Spo is going to be a legend, but I think him and his staff was one of the reasons they lost against Dallas the first year in Miami.  ",nba

I'd argue that the spurs were always a better team than the heat, so the heat weren't all that super.. although, to be fair to that point, wade basically became unreliable after the first year, and no one really could've expected that

he's a top 3 all time player, he might not be better or equal to jordan, but he has a chance, if he has more finals appearances even in losses like he did this last one, he'll probably cement 2nd, he's not getting to jordan to most people without at least one or two more rings, but a ring against this warriors team will go a very long way, even if he left the cavs to go to the spurs, provided he didn't get outdone by kawhi i guess",nba

The article I mentioned above describes Rodman as the best ""third best"" player in history. That is, he is the best glue guy ever. He is better than other glue guys by a wider margin than Jordan is better than other scorers, so if you were to do an all time fantasy draft pick, Rodman should arguably be your first choice - you can fill your scorer roles later while sacrificing less. The people listed in the top 5 here are better first options, sure, but a team also needs to fill its other roles, and Rodman is the GOAT at doing so and therefore arguably top 5.

Dallas has been playing zone since he's coached here, with great success, so it was a given that he would play the numbers and let Wade and LeBron take long jumpshots.

JJ Barea has already been a starter before two years ago to jumpstart a sometimes slow offense. Starting him wasn't a risk, look back on the first quarters in the Dallas-San Antonio series from 2009, the Mavs scored 18.5 points per 1st quarter with Barea on the bench compared to 30 points per 1st quarter with Barea as a starter. Barea was a known commodity, something that he had to do because Dallas kept falling behind against Miami.

Edit: I'm not saying he's a bad coach by any means, but I hear too many people here in Dallas salivating over how starting Barea was brilliant or how Carlisle's zone owned the Heat. Remember that Dwane Casey was the one teaching and coaching the defense on the sidelines, not Carlisle.",nba

Kyrie didn't have any intention of leaking, because it wouldn't benefit him. His trade value would be higher if teams didn't know Kyrie want to play elsewhere. So that probably meant Cavs didn't initiate that leak either.

Does adding more stats make BPM a better stat?  No, of course not.

Honestly, what do we hope for keeping a 32.5yo Lebron that will probably leave next summer anyway?

Why would anyone decide to get rid of Kyrie, a clutch superstar, for a player that, despite being the best in the game, will not ensure our short term future?

Yall should all shut up with the No Trade Clause. NTC mean nothing if Lebron ACCEPTS THE MOVE.

Looking at his behavior lately, it's clear that he is bored with this situation and Kyrie creating waves just made it IMPOSSIBLE to build a successful season (meaning, beat the Warriors) even if Kyrie stays.

So, knowing that, what team would Lebron accept to be traded to? A team with assets to give back too?

I honestly only see the Lakers. Lebron ain't going to the Clippers to play with Deandre (We would probably ask for Blake). Not many teams are in markets that Lebron want to build up the rest of his career.

To be honest, even if i HATE the idea, the Lakers seem to be an exit for Lebron as he would probably accept to be traded to LA if they keep Ball and Ingram.

Taking in account that i want to rebuild WITH KYRIE, i would send Lebron to LA for:

- Randle (will be double double machine that gives us rim protection)
- Clarkson (productive SG in good contract - get rid of JR next season)
- Larry Nance Jr (Why not. Young, athletic and cheap)
- Kuzma (yes, i take anyone with potential)
- Deng (to make salaries work)
- 1st round picks in 2019-2020.

Next season i can use any of these assets to get rid of Deng. Even Love could be used this way. 1st round picks won't be worth a lot with LBJ and maybe PG in LA. But they will be good to dump JR, Korver etc.

Anyway, all i am saying is that Cavs are better of getting it over with James. Thank you for everything KING. The Lakers will be a good match for the rest of his ending career and this trade will give us a lot of assets to rebuild in 1 season.

68366,"&gt; I'm saying that he's more likely to increase more in usage and make incremental increases to his ppg than to just balloon to 30 points a game, at his current rate.

I mentioned 25ppg next season, but I'd expect him to stay around there for at least a couple years.

&gt; But the goal should be to become more efficient, as to not waste possessions. Out of every player who's ever averaged 30+ points and averaged 5 assists, a field goal percentage of .423 (which he has now) would be the second worst of all time, sandwiched in between two A.I seasons. Are you honestly telling me you would rather have someone average 30 on bad efficiency than say, 26-27 on great efficiency?

I think the biggest factor is age and team situation here. Suns are a young developing team and with the addition of Jackson to help facilitate, I think Booker is in a great position for the future. Odds tend to favor a player improving efficiency overtime rather than declining (until the drop off after prime). Supporting cast plays a role as well. Of course, I'd hope he'd have better than .423 by the time he's close to averaging 30~ ppg and I think doing it on around .44-.45 would be reasonable. I mean I understand the point you're trying to make, but I imagine if we took the FG% of a few historically great scorers from their first or second year and eventually had 30~ ppg seasons, they'd rank pretty low too. There are also very few players who eventually averaged 30 ppg (or close to it) that already averaged 22 ppg in their second year.

The biggest reason I was able to enjoy it was by far the draft classes I got from Operation Sports. It was incredible seeing the level of detail people would put into a decade's worth of fictional draft classes. Especially when they created a backstory posted stats/footage/storylines from their college days and MarchMadness runs. Made the game way more immersive for me.
