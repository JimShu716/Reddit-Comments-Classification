2021,"&gt; But I believe what they have explicitly stated in that they will only ban based on verifiable reports

Of course they will say that, they won't say ""fuck yo stuff i will ban you when i want to"". What they say is not important really. You know whats important? reports of automatic bans, confirmed by blizzard support.

&gt;  they absolutely 100% have ways to verify this information

I hope so. But here is the thing, its much cheaper and more manageable to ban first, and only verify those who actually contact support, because people who won't contact support probably know what they did and that they won't get the ban lifted because the evidence is there, and because this way you will have much lower load on your staff. 

&amp;nbsp;

Remember, OW is played by millions(according to blizz), this amount of people is near impossible to moderate by any practical amount of humans they can hire. So they have to do trades here and there. This is just a guess, but since there have been a lot of reports of automated bans, and the fact that it was confirmed by blizz its automated, it pretty much confirms what i think.

&gt; So no, I don't think I will be banned

If you do get banned for no apparent reason, please do tell me, ok?

&gt; And with respect, if you think Blizzard is lying to you about their relationship with their player base than why would you be playing their games?

Listen, i don't think of companies as of some criminals, i just buy the game and i don't even think who made it(unless its ubisoft and the game is multiplayer, fuck that game in that case). But that doesn't mean companies don't have some shady practices.

&amp;nbsp;

You know what i don't believe in? i don't believe that its humanly possible to moderate a player base of 25million without automatic handling of many thing. Including automatic banning. You know why? numbers, that simple.

&amp;nbsp;

If 1 in a 100 people is toxic(and lets be real, this number is WAAY higher) and he gets reported multiple times, thats 250k people out of 25kk that need to be banned. 

Now if bans are handled manually, and to ban someone you have to press one button(which is 100% more than one button, but lets say its 1 button for the sake of showing the magnitude of the problem here), this button must be pressed 250k times. 

Lets say they hire 100 people in tech support, at which point the tech support itself is already a quarter(maybe bigger?) than the whole OW team. Even then, every tech support employee has to press the ban button 2500 times. 

&amp;nbsp;

Have you tried pressing one button 2500 times? let alone, someone has to verify the ban claim, right? do you even comprehend how much time that would take? And this is not a one time thing, it happens all the time, bans expire and new bans arrive.

You have a lot of effects over-lapping and it seems like, even during clips you make a point to add slows, flips, colour changes. This only makes the video harder to watch and increases your time editing. 
Be more conservative with these kinds of edits as the more you use them, the more they lose their effect.

Additionally, your intro is wayyy too long and really ambiguous. This maybe the result of trying to match the music, but if that's the case you need to find another track, or just cut down the intro, fade in and I literally wouldn't be able to tell the song didn't just start there, and you'd still have your beat drop sinc. Intro should be 15 seconds at VERY MOST, going beyond that only loses you viewers.

100+ hours is very long to be spent on a 5 minute video, even one that is heavily edited.

As long  as you have another healer like Mercy or Ana you are good to go!
He does not need a buff. In fact he just got one a few months ago.
Same goes for Zen, he provides debuffs to the enemy team and can heal your flankers from far off.
So if you don't have any main healer(ana, mercy) on your team, or don't have the two secondary healers at the same time, you should consider switching or playing differently

2650,I actually like playing Dva so that works out okay. Good Widowmakers are a nuisance like good Tracers.,Overwatch
2663,Yeah didnt even think of her. We had to get a comic where she appeared by the end of last year but it was cancelled. Maybe we'll get some information about her soon ^^,Overwatch
2700,"That is the whole game, it's a game of counters. Yes, Dive is the current ""60% of the time works every time"", but if the enemy has a really annoying player on their team you need to go ahead and counter them.

They have a Pharah that's being a pain you need a hitscan.

They have a Genji that's an utter pain you need something that can't be deflected.

They have a Tracer, you need a stun, AOE, or something that auto aims. 

They have a Winston that keeps jumping your healers - you need something that can do a lot of damage. 

They have a Symmetra you need to quickly kill her before she turns into a 120dps microwave of doom. 


Mercy, well here you have to single her out and kill her and then the rest of the team. If she has the time to respawn, run back from spawn, and rez that means that your team did fuck all during that time either because your healers died, your tanks where shit, or you have too little damage going forward. With enough control you can re-wipe the whole team after she resurrects them. 

Yes it is one of the most game-changing ults but a lot of them can completely flip a game upside down if used right. Lets be honest, how many times do you get huge rezes (4-5), at about idk 100 hours total as Mercy I pulled off one 5, and about five 4s, then innumerable 3s and 2

Going back to the whole counter-game. Back in 4th season I had this one game on Ilios the enemy team had the world's slipperiest Genji and Tracer. Guys moved so erratically you'd hit maybe one in 20 hits. At 5th round, which was the one in the little house over a cliff I went from a tank to Symmetra as an all or nothing. I W+M1'd through that Genji, Tracer, and at least 2 others (was a POTG), and set up turrets on the point, if I'd stay Rein or w/e I was playing we'd probably lose. And believe me that change was questioned hard, I just said ""It's all or nothing, either they die or we lose"". ",Overwatch

You hit the nail on the head when you said that 1 out of 10 games seem actually fair and evenly matched. Because most of them really aren't. I rarely felt like *""Oh well at least we gave it our all and tried to win""* whenever I lose a match, because games in OW usually feel like: 1. total wipeouts, where one team totally curbstomps the other or 2. seemingly even until half way through someone flips their shit and then it becomes a wipeout anyways.",Overwatch

The potential for ill has to do with the chance that a troll reports a legitimate player and due to the inevitable occurence of human error manages to inflict a punishment on them.  Reporting a success (or perhaps even just a potential success as is the case in LoL) becomes a positive feedback loop that encourages the troll to increase his volume of attacks.  As trolls collectively increase their volume of attacks, the likelihood of false positives goes up even more.

Bottom line, a solid reporting system may stop the weakest of trolls out there, but committed trolls are always going to find ways around the system and potentially even subvert it to their own devices, and the ones left to bear the burden of such a system are erroneously punished legitimate players.  Just like hacks, you can't really directly combat them because your efforts are only ever going to stop the most blatant offenders, but not anyone with any level of sophistication.",Overwatch

&gt;&gt;###### **Junkrat:**

&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;- ###### Concussion Mine

&gt;&gt;, damage reduced to 90

&gt;&gt;- ###### Junkrat Trap

&gt;&gt;, increase damage to 110

&gt;&gt;- ###### Concussion mine

&gt;&gt;, reduce cooldown to 4 seconds

&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;**###### Results

&gt;&gt;**

&gt;&gt;- Trap+Mine = 200 damage

&gt;&gt;- Grenade+Mine = 210 damage

&gt;&gt;- Trap is way more deadly. 

&gt;&gt;- Can't spam 2 mines and kill 200HP. For balance reasons.

&gt;&gt;- Grenade + Mine is a much more frequent and consistent combo

&gt;&gt;- Junkrat's survivability and mobility goes way up because he can use a ConcMine every 4 seconds to engage/retreat.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;This is pretty close to what we're trying with him, and what will likely be on the PTR when it comes back up. Currently on our internal builds Junkrat has 2 charges of his Concussion Mine. This allows you to do all kinds of cool stuff like launch yourself into a fight and still have a charge to escape with, or launch yourself up into a Pharah and still have a charge to try and kill her with. Previously this was possible before but you had to plant one on the ground and then wait for the cooldown to come back before doing this. That is still possible, which allows for a triple jump now if you want/need that, but now it is a lot more reliable to do with 2. It has been a ton of fun to play with so far.

&gt;

&gt;We're also looking at making his ult a bit better. We're experimenting with a movement speed increase or a health increase on the tire. We wouldn't do both things but in either case it should be more reliable to use in more situations.

3034,"Sure, I know it's someone's job, and I also know that the lore is absolutely, 100% secondary to things that actually exist in the game. It's why there can be two Tracers in a game. It's why enemies in the lore save each other in-game, and allies kill each other. It *doesn't matter*. It's just officially-sanctioned fanfic. It's backstory for the people, like you presumably, who should really be reading a book instead.

The ""style and atmosphere"" has *way* more to do with the in-game art design and how well everything is animated than some auxiliary comics Blizzard has released. The personality and interactions between the characters are nice, I'll give you that, but nothing that actually becomes part of the experience you have while playing the game should be *subservient* to the lore. They're making it up as they go, it does not dictate the direction of the game. Want Doomfist to be voiced by Terry Crews? Keep literally all the lore the same and add a sentence at the end that says ""Also he's kind of wacky"". Bam. Done.

I think it's fine, he sounds pretty good. It's kind of a letdown. Maybe it would have worn thin after a while. I'd love if there was some event where he had different voicelines, you could even say it's set in the past before some traumatic event made him much more serious to satiate the people perturbed by the lack of continuity in the arcs of characters who capture the same point tens of thousands of times a night. Or a legendary skin with some rare voice lines. Whatever.

But, yeah, the takeaway is that lore is bullshit, and they could have made it what they needed it to be to fit whatever personality Doomfist ended up being by editing a paragraph for about five minutes. This is not a story-based game. It's fun backstory for people who care but it should never dictate what can and can't happen, it will always be a tertiary concern, if that.",Overwatch

Everything I say is just ignored because it cant get past your giant overinflated ego. It is a significant problem but you cant see it because you have no empathy and clearly don't even understand the game.""

I can't accept the argument because I have a counter-argument. If I had no counter argument, I would accept the argument. It is as simple as that. 

Why are you arguing the point of whether or not *your argument* should be accepted, rather than the argument itself? That does nothing here other than you personally attacking me. On top of that, I find that it's very hypocritical that you're making the argument of ""over-inflated ego"" yet you won't yield to the fact that this is what you're doing, so much so that I had to ask for a moderator to intervene *whom also sees the same problem that I do with the way you're conducting the argument.* You're making this into an argument about me personally rather than the point, and that has been apparent from the first thing you even responded with:

&gt; The chance doesn't matter. What DOES matter is that it completely ruins the game for one team, and unbalances the game for the other team. But you can't see that because you are blinded by pride.

So please stop.


Moving onto the argument itself, the mathematical chance of the behavior occurring is in-fact a counter argument. To state that it's not is silly. I'm going to make a very simple analogy that will explain why it is silly, and I hope you can understand this one:

Imagine we have two miniature clones of Earth, A and B, that we can observe for testing purposes, specifically two for following a methodology similar to having a *control* and contrasting it with a *variable,* a practice I'm sure you remember from high-school science. 

On each Earth, imagine we can play God, and we possess the power to directly change the percentage of how likely it is for any one person to experience or be grieved by, lets say: terrorism, to any percentage we desire. If we change the entirety of Earth A's population to having a 20%--one in five--annual likelihood of being affected by terrorism, and Earth B's to 0.2%--one hundred times less--this will produce drastically different results for how people carry out their daily lives. 

I assume that on Earth A, overall satisfaction for quality of life would be *far* lower. I also assume that people would go through extra precautions on a daily basis, which would effect how they ultimately lead their daily lives in the attempt to minimize their chances of being affected each day.

Can the same be said for Earth B? I don't think it could be. If I brought forth the example that 65,640,000 people live in Britain, only 131,280 would be affected by terrorism annually on our Earth B. That's not enough to warrant changing your lifestyle. At all. 130,000 out of 65,000,000? Subtract those two and you have 64,870,000. You can't even reasonably feel the difference between those numbers, it's so infinitesimally small. Nothing would change for the average person in your daily life when compared to Earth A.

If, like you argue:

&gt; The chance doesn't matter.

this percent in my analogy could be as high or small as you want to make it, and to logically follow your argument, people would have to act the same in each Earth regardless of the percent. This completely throws your line of logic out of the window. Utterly. It completely ruins it from the de-facto perspective. 

Lets now bring this analogy into Overwatch.

So the main differences between my analogy and what the state of the actual math is in Overwatch, is that the competitive player-base is roughly 120,000 people. Bronze makes up roughly 1,200, 1% of that. Bronze *and* Silver makes up roughly 4,800. This is where most of the frustration occurs for games being thrown, as this is where new account MMR starts, before any comp games are completed. If there are at any given time, a concurrent of 10 streamers doing this challenge, which I do believe is an *extremely* generous allocation of such a number, it works out to be 0.02% of the playerbase of Bronze and Silver which this applies to. This is one-thousandth of the 20% Earth/terrorism analogy, and we determined that one-hundredth was already insignificantly low.

My analogy also deals with something that is irreversible, entertaining results such as life and death. This is an experience which is repairable. It's far less significant than the implications of the Earth analogy, yet it's still enough to be insignificantly low. Not to say that it would ""not be a problem,"" but not enough to seriously change your daily way of life and expected life experience.

If you can't fathom how little 0.2% matters, let alone 0.02%, watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J6BQDKiYyM

Just wait until he reaches 100,000,000, take 1/3rd from it mentally, pause the video on 70,000,000, etc, and take away 1 and 1/3rd ""$100,000""s. This demonstrates how insignificantly small what we're dealing with here is. Then apply it to the 1000 times smaller example, not the 100 times smaller of the analogy.

It's not like there's ever a solo Mercy or Ana being suplimented by a Soldier or Sombra. Because you can't DPS and heal at the same time, especially soldier, it's far too distracting to drop that biotic field when other teammates are around. It's much more effective for soldier to run behind cover and save all the heals for just himself.

And Sombra builds ult much more quickly when you don't hack health packs near your team and just focus on damage.

No one would ever run 3 tanks, what would we ever call that... triple tank, no that sounds stupid.

The stun interrupts ults, and even if you're not interrupting ults, you still repostitioned the enemy which is a big deal completely on its own because you almost always guarantee that *someone* on your team kills them even if it's not you.

And that's the hook on its own. Again, you don't need the hook to one shot! Even in the instances where the hook is on cooldown, left clicks on nearby targets during team fights or right clicks during initiations is typically sufficient and yes was very consistent. That was just too much firepower from someone so hard to kill. The nerf was necessary. A buff is also necessary. But that damage had to go one way or another.",Overwatch
6173,"Honestly besides D.va and Orisa, and occasionally Zarya as maybe a back up tank, they aren't that fun for me. Rein is broken and lol what's this Hog guy still doing here?

8667,"&gt;While that would never be feasible on console,

Except loads of console games already have text chat, and have done so for a few hardware generations now. Consoles first widely supported keyboards (and mice, too) with the Dreamcast and that's continued on through each generation since, either via platform-specific hardware (e.g. chatpad add-ons to controllers) or simply plug-and-play USB. Both the Xbox One and PS4 support keyboards. Games like Final Fantasy XIV, which is cross-play with PS3, PS4, and PC, *rely* on players having access to at least a keyboard, if not also a mouse, in addition to the controller. (In fact having all three is by far the best way to play FFXIV, regardless of which platform you're on; combat is best with a controller, period, a mouse really helps for UI navigation, and a keyboard is near-vital for communication and setting up macros.)  

Now you've also got things like the Nintendo Switch which is hooking up your mobile to handle chat, too.  

On top of that, console Overwatch does seem to already have the chat box in place. If you play against AI, the bots are able to send the usual victory messages (e.g. ""GG :|"") to where the chat box is/should be, indicating that the ability to display the chat is already there.

**tl;dr:** The thing you say will ""never be feasible"" has already existed for years and there's no reason whatsoever for console Overwatch players to not have access to it.",Overwatch
8670,"Yeah the lack of information without voice coms is a fundamental problem.

I squelched their chat and everything but 3 people spamming hello non stop made me tilt like no other and I got off. I genuinely couldn't think because D.Va and Mercy and Genji's voicelines were ringing in my ears. 

I wish leaving comms and focusing on your own play could have an impact in the game, but it reduces your chance of winning pretty severely IMO. 

In Dota, you know when a teamfight is coming. It's very clear and it's very important that everyone participates. There's no chance that one of your teammates just wont go to it and use everything they have. Well, there is a chance, but it's much less than in OW where you don't know if your team wants to fight or not. 

In Overwatch, if you're not in comms and you engage in a teamfight with your team and they don't follow up and they back out, it's **your fault.** Not theirs for not using ults. This now means you'll probably be at a big disadvantage for at least a minute and a half.

There's also a severe lack of comeback mechanics. In Dota, you can lose the entire game but win in the last 15 minutes, easily. In OW, it's pretty clear to see how everything will pan out after the first 10 minutes.",Overwatch

8881,"It's hard to say, really. I don't have much experience judging game's lifespans. 

The devs seem to think this game will go on for many years; that's understandable, since they're the ones behind this, and they likely want to keep it going for as long as possible. They also want people to think and feel like it's going to go on for a while, too, which is important: once people start thinking en masse 'yeah, Overwatch is starting to die', the vibe may spread fast and people may gravitate away from it as the 'feeling' that it's dying / dead sits, regardless of what the devs may be doing at the time to try to keep the game fresh and interesting. 

Overwatch has been in people's sight and minds since launch; since way before launch, really. The game itself and everything surrounding it has been going very strong for the last year and almost a month. However, some people have already shown signs of fatigue (some of those who played from launch and finally got tired from playing too often, those who see it everywhere and just weren't much a fan to begin with and want it out of their faces, etc.). It's hard to say if those kinds of people are even having that big of an impact on people's views and opinions of the game. 

I'd like to think that it'll last for a long time; I just don't know what 'a long time' is, and it's weird trying to pinpoint that. Part of me feels like it'll last a year more; part of me feels like it very well could go for a couple more years. I really don't know. There's too many variables to keep note of to accurately say how long it'll last. 

When I said 'we could use 2-3 more healer heroes over the course of the game's lifespan', that was me assuming it'd go for another, say, 2-3 years max. That was also me factoring how many heroes max this game would seem right with. But that was just a spur-of-the-moment thought. I really don't know how long it could last. ",Overwatch

Im going to regale you a tale of the past week of OW competitive for me. And this isn't the first time its happened (though not this bad).

I managed to climb back up to 2450ish, 1-2 games away from plat. Had lots of good matches, close games and highly competitive and fun rounds. I wasn't angry at any of our losses, or people playing sub optimal picks, we all talked and worked together.

Enter sunday: 15 game lose streak. EVERY-SINGLE-GAME, thrower, or a duo/trio that joined up to purposely throw. Now i'd say about 5 of those games had people just tilted, ok w/e just mute em and move on. But the rest? 100% purposeful sitting on the side building torb turrets in the basement. 

What is the response to that? WHAT can i do? The best damn answer anyone can seem to give is to just stop playing the game and play it later? Really? Just stop playing and it'll go away? I wish. Next day was pretty much the same, but as i slipped back towards 2200ish rating the ratio of tilt rised and more and more people just joining up refusing to work together. 

Then today. Today was special. I've played 3 hours so far. Im down to 2000 rating because i've gotten paired up with premades that purposely throw to lower their SR, while tanking mine since our team based rating is roughly 150 higher. 3 separate ""teams"" have done this to us today, i got matched with them different times at least twice each. Took a break, came back oh look another 3 man just throwing great. 

This is the reason i avoided competitive all this time. The fear of people just being shits and throwing games for no reason. I read on here that its never been this bad, but i find that hard to believe. I honestly don't know what to do for this game anymore. Quick play is 100% unplayable and filled to the brim with trolls and try and make the game as shitty as possible. Comp is apparently becoming unplayable the lower i sink into SR due to games that are out of my control. Everyone's answer is to just come back later lol. I'm not tilted, defeated if anything but not tilted. I just wanna play GOOD GAMES, games where both teams are trying and not working on being sad children to each other. ",Overwatch

9329,"&gt;In Overwatch, whether your MMR goes up or down is contingent on winning or losing. But there are a number of factors that determine how much that rating goes up or down. For example, what map you’re playing on and whether you were attacking or defending is factored in. We know the win rates on attack/defend on all of the maps and we normalize accordingly. Not all wins and losses are equal. We also look at your individual performance on each of the heroes you played during the match. Everyone has better and worse heroes and we have tons of data showing us what performance levels should be like on those heroes. We also look at your opponents and whether or not their matchmaking rating is higher or lower than yours. These are just a few of the things that are considered when determining how your skill should go up or down. At no point in MMR calculations do we look at your win/loss ratio and win/loss ratio is never used to determine who to match you with or against. We are not trying to drive your win/loss percentage toward a certain number (although the fact that so many people are at 50% win rates makes us extremely happy). All the system does when it comes to matching on skill is attempt to match you with people of a similar number. 

&gt;

&gt;The system is of course deeper than this. There are penalties and handicaps added for things like not playing for a while or playing in groups of varying sizes. We also do special things for brand new players to (hopefully) keep them away from the general population. Players will often mistakenly look at player level and accuse the matchmaker of making unfair matches. One thing that I have mentioned before is that we were evaluating your skill during closed beta, open beta and the second stress test weekend. If you played in any of these (over 10 million players did), we had already determined a skill rating for you (most likely). This means that it’s not uncommon to see a level 1 matchmade against much higher level players.  In most of these cases, the Level 1 is a skilled player who played during the phases I mentioned but did not immediately play at launch.

&gt;

&gt;There are many factors that are beyond our control that add noise to the matchmaking system.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;•        Leavers are extremely disruptive

&gt;

&gt;•        Players vary wildly in their skill with different heroes. We have no clue which of the 21 heroes you are going to play during a match

&gt;

&gt;•        Groups form with wild variance in skill levels and ping. Contrary to popular belief there is not a “perfect match” for your unique snowflake group

&gt;

&gt;•       Sometimes your little brother plays on your account

&gt;

&gt;•       Sometimes the cat walks in front of the screen

&gt;

&gt;•        Sometimes your wireless mouse runs out of batteries. (Why do you use a wireless mouse btw?)

&gt;

&gt;•        Sometimes a highly skilled player buys a new copy of OW to “start fresh” on a new account

&gt;

&gt;•        Sometimes you have internet problems

&gt;

&gt;•        Sometimes you play drunk or tired… or both

&gt;

&gt;•        That first game of the night…

&gt;

&gt;•        …that last game of the night

&gt;

&gt;•        “Life”

&gt;

&gt;So this brings me to some thoughts I’ve been having about Overwatch. While this whole post has been mostly my personal thoughts – this next part is “especially” my thoughts and not reflective of the team or the company’s POV. 

&gt;

&gt;For better or for worse, we focused the design of the game on winning or losing as a team. OW is not a game where you ignore the map objectives and then look at your K/D ratio to determine how good you are. We want you to focus on winning or losing and as a result you do focus on winning or losing. We tried to make it so that losing isn’t the end of the world, but to a lot of people they expect to win far much more than they lose. I sometimes wonder if we were able to clone you 11 times and then put you in a match with and against yourself, would you be happy with the outcome? Even if you lost? Out of the 5 types of matches I described above, it is my belief that you would still experience types 1-4. Are those “stomps” still not acceptable? Because they will happen…

&gt;

&gt;And I believe OW is strange game in that regard. I spend a lot of time studying the matches that I am in because I am very focused on matchmaking. I’ve been in so many Control Point maps where my team got destroyed on the first point, the enemy team got destroyed on the second point and then we play the third point to a 99%/99% overtime. If you judged any of those single points on their own merits you could say you have two stomps (one in your favor, one against you) and one close match. Same players...no change in matchmaking. Or take a match that I was just in on Route 66, for example. My team was on attack and could barely push out past the train cars. Two members of our team swapped heroes and we proceeded to march the payload all the way to the end of the map practically uncontested. The match went from a stomp in one direction to a stomp in the other direction.

&gt;

&gt;So while it is possible for a mismatch to result in a stomp, not every stomp is a mismatch. If every time a team dominates another team it is viewed as “the matchmaker is broken”, the problem we have is with perception and expectations. Look across all pro sports. Even matches happen every night. Stomps happen every night. It’s a reality of any competitive game. Does that make being on the receiving end sting any less – probably not.

&gt;

&gt;We are constantly improving the matchmaker. We learn more each day. We have one of our best engineers and best designers full time dedicated to the system. Many of those “silent” patches that go out during the week are adjustments to the system. For example, we recently realized that “Avoid this player” was wreaking havoc on matchmaking. One of the best Widowmaker players in the world complained to us about long queue times. We looked into it and found that hundreds of other players had avoided him (he’s a nice guy – they avoided him because they did not want to play against him, not because of misbehavior). The end result was that it took him an extremely long time to find a match. The worst part was, by the time he finally got a match, he had been waiting so long that the system had “opened up” to lower skill players. Now one of the best Widowmaker players was facing off against players at a lower skill level. As a result, we’ve disabled the Avoid system (the UI will go away in an upcoming patch). The system was designed with the best intent. But the results were pretty disastrous.

&gt;

&gt;We will always be working on our matchmaking system. We’re listening to feedback, we’re playing the game a ton ourselves and we’re looking at hard data to inform our decisions. This post wasn’t my way of saying everything is fine. I just wanted to share some of my thoughts as someone who has been evaluating the system itself very closely as well as monitoring the feedback. I want to put it out there that there is a lot of room for improvement but also suggest that there are forces in play that cause some fair matches to sway lopsided due to forces out of our control. The game is as much (if not more) art than it is science. We’ll keep working to make it better!

9425,"How about you look at it? Here are some facts for you:

Placements don't matter, you pretty much always get put ~200 lower than your last season end. But let's say she got placed at 1000, which is 500 more than her last season end.

Now let's assume she gains 50 rank for all 61 wins. I've NEVER seen anyone gain that much, let alone consistently. But sure, 61 wins x 50 rank = 3050.

So that puts her at 4050. But WAIT, she also lost 52% of her games. Well, I don't know how many losses she had cuz it doesn't say. But I can work out it. [Google tells me 48% of 127 is 60.96](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=48%25+of+127&amp;cad=h) so let's say she has 127 games, which would put her at 66 losses. If we assume she loses 10 rank per game, that means a loss of 660, which would put her new rank at 3390.

Hmm now wait a second, something here doesn't add up. I've never seen anyone consistently gain 50 rank, and lose 10 rank, yet even with these horribly exagerrated numbers, your screenshot doesn't add up. Unless it's.....Hold on...Wait, it could be fake?

Look at the top 500 icon. Notice how in both screenshots, the top 500 icons are in the same frame of animation.

So yeah, in summary, show me this guy's overbuff and then I'll believe you. But NOTHING here adds up. Even if you're way below your MMR, I've never seen anyone gain more than 50 per game, let alone consistently. Remember, love with your heart, use your head for everything else.",Overwatch

I didnt mention other players impacting your SR but its possible that they do... Its just that the more games you play, the less likely it is that they are to blame. The way the system is designed to work is that you will fluctuate between a range of SR. Its hard to say what your ""true"" SR is because when you win and lose your SR will obviously vary. I also think that the system aims to counterbalance the lack of ""perfect"" games with all of the horrible games you have.

So if we have a tank, I'll gladly pick Mercy/Zen/Lucio. If we have a healer, I'll gladly pick whichever tank I think is best against the opposing team. I just dislike picking a healer that won't get protected or a tank that can't be healed.

There's different things you can do to contribute to your team beyond healing. Call out flankers, stay alive instead of dying to flankers often, manage your own ults well, track enemy ults for your team and call them out before they might happen, and so on. General game sense is very valuable in overwatch and will win you games no matter what role. 

You can also try flexing to other categories. When you already have two good supports on your team or even just one other support but you really need a tank or dps, flexing is very valuable. In overwatch, countering enemy heroes is very strong - you can turn a game by switching to pharah when they don't have hitscan just because they can't do anything. Seeing and fixing your own team weaknesses is also a good idea, which may mean switching to a specific tank or dps. 

There's also no real reason not to group with people. If you enjoy playing with a particular person on your team, add them as a friend.",Overwatch

However in hindsight I think it just limits the fun for people. Someone might come home after a long day of work, just wanting to play some Gengu, only to find that he's already been picked, so he has to pick something else. I feel like QP could do with being a bit more free, while still not being quite as rediculous as something like Total Mayhem in the Arcade.

If QP was supposed to be a place to practice for Comp, then yeah, of course you'd want there to be the 1-hero limit. And that was probably part of the reason it was implemented. But it simply isn't a good place for that, so I'd rather them just remove the limit and add a proper Unranked mode where people can practice :)

Sure it might get a bit crazy at times, I remember it sucking to play against these really cheesy comps, but I don't think it'd be much less fun than it currently is to play with 6 dps players. In fact I could see it being kind of refreshing for a bit.

Sombra-Mei-Junkrat actually all have high DPS potential if you're actually hitting the target and not getting killed in the process as well as trapping like crazy and have 76 mop them up. Still not sure what tank I'd use though. Really depends on the map as well. Dive comp is only really sucessfull with really high team morale, you slow it down constantly and morale will drop and people start making mistakes bla bla bla. the Sombra-Mei-Junkrat REALLY relies on staying alive if you do that it can be successful and they all can get out of danger pretty well if you know what you're doing. Still risky af but if you got the gumption, speed, gamesense, predictive ability, accuracy, and ballz it could work but that's how it is for all team comps it's just dive comp has this air of invincibility right now and it makes people question themselves in their ability to make different picks and/or only focusing on dive comp heroes.

12733,"I don’t play in high ranks but from all the stuff I see in plat I can see why other women don’t feel comfortable using voice chat even in high ranks. Especially if they’re playing support. 

It’s like people have more expectations from girl gamers because they actually expect them to be less good. It’s stressful. Make a mistake = girls are trash at video games, you should just play Mercy. Play Mercy = all girls play support because they can’t play anything else and Mercy is trash and OP anyway.

Also, honestly, let’s not talk about the douches who directly say “Oh I have a hard on” when they hear a girl speak in voice chat. Not sure if it happens in higher ranks though. 

Or the typical “go back to your kitchen.” Always appreciate hearing that one.

Any roadhog that ""goes out of his way to take damage for teammates"" is costing his team the game because that is not how you play him.

Again, 600 HP doesn't matter due to his hitbox and complete lack of defensive mechanisms. A tracer only has 150 HP but you usually have a really low accuracy against her. So she only takes 40 HP damage per second against a soldier, but the same soldier does 180 dps against roadhog because you can't miss him.

12913,"While I enjoy overwatch, I actually dislike this stance a lot. I would prefer to see more balance going on, but I come from playing mobas, and maybe that spoils me a little with the constant balance changes to heroes and League and other mobas I have played. 

Yes, each balance patch does cause what Jeff Kaplan refers to as artificial meta changing, as the patches are the developers buffing things that are weak and nerfing things that are strong. But the pro level matters the most to me, and yet I always see myself as a casual player. The reason it matters is for the viewing experience, and if Overwatch League is going to have the viewer numbers and stadium numbers they want, the game has to be balanced very heavily toward the pro side, much like traditional sports where the majority are viewers who don't play, Overwatch will need similar numbers as the player base isn't nearly large enough to support filling arenas every week. 
 
This leads to a point regarding balance, is it not fun for casuals to play a game balanced for pros? Well that can depend on the kind of game, I think in Overwatch you can balance for the pro scene and still offer players in the casual scene a good experience. Basically removing things that are very exploitable by pros but keeping the core experience the same. The main issue players have is viability. Right now the meta is considered stale because without a new hero release every month or two or major balance changes every month or even a new map that provides advantages for particular heroes we won't see changes in the meta. This is due to the 1% idea, if something is even 1% better or easier to execute then it will be played by pros, and subsequently played by everyone else because if the guys doing it for a living think it is the best and casual players who log much fewer hours want to win, they will play what others have spent time researching. You see it most often in mobas with item builds or talent picks, players copycat because they know it works, and rather than invest time in doing R&amp;D it is better to hop on the bandwagon.

That being said, what does that mean for Blizzard, it means they might need to be more aggressive with buffs toward characters outside the meta, I think the characters in the meta are often strong due to their mechanics and not necessarily their numbers, where the characters outside the meta can't compete, and the roster is too small for those characters to see viability. If there were bans and no mirroring and a roster of about double the heroes you would see different picks, but right now about 8 heroes are viable out of 32 or so.... that is pretty rough.

The real key to D.Va versus Sym is the same as every hero versus Sym. Don't engage into Symmetra's tiny niche ideal scenario. If a Symm is fully charged hopping right on top of me it will be hard to win without fantastic tracking. So I don't let that happen.

What you're talking about here is pretty much the reason why I ended up writing my competitive Overwatch guide a couple of months ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchUniversity/comments/5q9tlm/i_accidentally_ended_up_writing_an_introduction/

What later became section 5 actually started out as a reply to someone asking about compositions and meta. The point I was trying to make there was pretty much:

**Don't play heroes you're significantly worse at, just so that your team can adhere to the meta.**

Now, the best way to rise in ranks is probably to get good at a large number of heroes. Doing so both means that you can switch and counter most potential problems your team is having, as well as making it easier for you to identify exactly what the problem(s) is(/are).

&amp;nbsp;

If you want to get into the reason why this is the case, it pretty much boils down to the fact that people in general believe skills transfer to a higher extent than they do between heroes and classes. Yes, aim transfers to a certain extent (not fully though, since different heroes have different shooting and/or movement mechanics), and yes, having played against a hero a lot does give you some understanding of how it's played. However, a large part of getting good at a hero is learning the subtleties, as well as muscle memory, and you only get those by actually playing the hero a lot.",Overwatch

14013,"It's actually possible, and one of the worst things about having ""parallel"" systems involved in ranked. League of Legends, Rocket League, Heroes of the Storm, and pretty much any other game that uses the ""tiered"" rank system suffers the same problem.

Basically, you have a ""hidden"" MMR (often based on the Elo system with some variations depending upon the type of game/match you are being ranked for) that *actually* determines who you play against, that technically has no real connection to your displayed rank. So you could theoretically have an MMR that's close to the average for a high Platinum/low Diamond player while being visually displayed/ranked as a ""Gold"" player (or the reverse, have a ""low"" MMR but a high rank). Usually this is caused by winning or losing streaks, or doing really well or really poorly in placements and early on in your ranked career. LoL (and maybe some others with similar systems) also has the issue of only advancing via a best-of-3/5 series, so you can win virtually every game and still have bad luck in your promotion series and be stuck in a low rank with a high MMR/Elo.

It's a definite problem that is observed by many players on a fairly regular basis. Get on a winning streak after a losing streak and you'll run into the problem temporarily almost every time - having to play against players that are ""better"" than you in rank just to advance ahead of the other players that are ""the same"" as you in rank.",Overwatch

14089,"&gt; Why couldn't there be a slightly forced delay (say 0.5s or whatever sounds reasonable) between AA and Junkrat's shift?

Because he's barely half viable as is. Animation cancels exist for a large portion of the cast to help them actually be playable, hell, animation cancels are what let genji ""one shot"" people at all.

In fact, one of the only two animations junkrat can't cancel is his reload, which is very long and provides more than enough time for a genji to left click-&gt;dash-&gt;180-&gt;right click and that would be more than enough to kill him.

You can also actually utillize genji's kit, particularly his deflect. He can deflect Junkrat's grenades and his mine. Genji's strength comes in getting the jump on his opponents, and aggressively controlling the situation of a 1v1. If you want slower, reactionary play, try zarya or orisa, as they can take a few hits while they react.

 I don't know what it is about Plat, but I've encountered so many smurfs this season. I'm talking about Genji/McCree/Soldier/Widow/Hanzo mains with a 40% winrate on Lucio/Mercy but a 70% or above win rate on those carry heroes. You can just tell they are smurfs with their stats and the way they perform with them and are either boosting a friend's account or on a smurf trying to boost one of their friends in duo queue. Competitive has become more of a gamble now to see who gets that Masters/Grandmaster smurf on their team instead of actually playing with others in your own skill. And that's not to mention the throwers/leavers/trolls.

On the upside, however, I managed to farm enough CP so that I'll finally be able to afford my gold D.Va guns at the end of the season.

Balancing around that hook has been an absolute nightmare. I do think they can rework it in a way, but I don't think his goal should be killing characters. It takes away from the Offense class  and doesn't make him a pick you want to use for actual job he's in. ",Overwatch

But Hanzo just seems like a really campy, typical caricature of a suicidal Japanese warrior who hates himself for dishonoring/disobeying the clan... in the far distant future.  It's like they picked a bunch of old-timey stereotypes of Japanese warriors from old movies and turned them into a single character in an era far, far away.  


I doubt he's *that* one sided, but until we actually get more lore on Hanzo, he's just gonna feel like a caricature to me.  Genji feels like an actual Japanese character, and Hanzo feels like an American film buff's idea of what a Japanese person is like.  The large lack of Japanese in Hanzo's voice acting doesn't help.

Eventually 50, then 100.  

Why? Two reasons.

First it cuts down on smurfing--a LOT.  It's one thing to smurf when you can hop in, play a few hours and hit 25, then blast your way up.  It's another to have to go through the *extended* tutorial and game sense modification experience that is qp for several *days* to get to 50 or 100.

Second, the player base is *FAR* more experienced than it used to be.  At launch, you had pretty much two groups: beta players and the metric crapton of new accounts.  Beta players were FAR outnumbered, so the *vast* majority of the population was new to the game.

But in a year, the game has evolved--and competitive and regular players are MUCH more experienced at this game.  Everything from having a good sense of map layouts to understanding various animation cancels, and then things like understanding principles of a good team.

These are all things that mean that a GOLD player today is actually likely BETTER than a GOLD player 1 year ago.

Because SR is RELATIVE TO OTHER PLAYERS NOT BASED ON SOME ABSOLUTE STANDARD, it CHANGES over time.  In all likelihood it means that keeping the same SR requires you to improve over time.  It might be a small change, but it's going to be there.  ",Overwatch

Doomfist's character is a smart, sophisticated badass which does not match Terry Crews, therefore it would not work. How is this hard for you?

Solo-q is a different beast 

You say ""git gud"" but clearly if my first account is stuck at silver but my new one placed at low plat and is pushing diamond, clearly I'm not a silver player.

Same player, same skills, 2 accounts.. the difference must be, by process of elimination, an external factor: teammates.

Blizzard's system of placing people lower than their MMR so they can rank up at the beginning of the season is broken for people anywhere under high plat. If you are on the cusp, placing below your proper SR puts you in a tier where the genuinely awful players who have no idea about how to play the game are, and then good luck getting out alone.

It's exponentially worse if you do your placements later in the season, as everyone has already ""settled"" to their correct SR, so someone who ends a season at mid gold ends up being placed in silver, with other *actual silvers* rather than other players who just placed below their proper SR and are supposed to ""feel the joy of ranking up""

I don't think old Reaper was bad by any means (even before the buff he could still be a menace to the enemy team), but Roadhog's higher damage, longer range, higher health, ranged crowd control and powerful self heal didn't really give Reaper any particular edge over Roadhog - he was considered bad for no fault in his kit, but that there was a hero better in practically every way than him.    
    
I guess alternatively you could reduce Roadhog's fire rate and magazine size (so that he's a slow but powerful Tank)? Would also make him more unique.    
    
(about the Take A Breather point(s) - the healing is the main bonus. It means the Healer(s) can heal a different teammate while Roadhog can handle himself. The 50% damage resistance combined with the 300hp self heal will allow Roadhog to negate certain abilities - using Pulse Bomb on Roadhog as he uses Take A Breather will allow him to heal a net 100hp instead of taking a net 100 damage. Genji's Dragonblade and Reaper's Death Blossom will be even less effective than they are against Roadhog. That and Roadhog has flat out higher health than Orisa while having a similar hitbox. While I can't be sure yet, I don't think it should be underestimated so soon.)",Overwatch

19225,"It's happened to any character that's gotten nerfed. It started with the tryhard genji mains who complained originally about Genji's big nerf, saying they couldn't 1v6 a team anymore and could only 1v5. Now we see Genji still being extremely powerful, warranting for a nerf or atleast a fix to his animation cancels. 

This was followed by D.Va mains after D.va was utterly destroyed by a nerf to her everything, making her near useless until her DM found a massive use in dive comp meta. 

Ana mains were up next, as the big changes to Ana were put onto PTR. For the first time in OW history, we see blizz revert the changes because Ana mains said that she lost survivability without her extra flask healing, even though her healing was very high for that current meta. The changes were reverted and we only got the damage reduction. (rightly so)

Finally we arrive to hog, his nerfs making it harder to one shot things (but not impossible, he still can one shot all 200hp heroes) at the cost of a faster fire rate and an extra shot in his clip.

19257,"First thing I will say is that quick play is drastically different from competitive. If you went into ranked with the same composition or mindset as quickplay, you will have trouble.

Secondly, I found that being in a group at low levels actually resulted in poor performance overall. You will get matched against another team of three, and they are likely more experienced than you. If you go in alone, you may be surprised as how often you win without your teammates.

Finally, playing in a party can be rough, since you are stuck with the same players. If they aren't up to snuff, you can't do anything about it, except lose repeatedly. Also, the same three people aren't going to be learning any new tactics. You will be stuck in a ""groupthink"".  ",Overwatch

Kinda reminds me of playing CS:GO on like ESEA or something, where your skill was measured by a number called RWS, which is essentially a metric created based off of kills, damage, etc. Like OP said, it incentivizes selfish play rather than team play.

Everyone has time to pick their players at the beginning and if you missed the opportunity to get who you want, then tough shit. It's not the end of the world that that kid didn't get pharah, and if they were ""a god"" with pharah, I'm sure they should be decent with someone else.

19604,"It's honestly so obnoxious how high rank players justify their ego this way. For example, the other day when Seagull said ""git gud"" to a subscriber asking about ELO Hell. Both sides have a bias for their argument. If you are low ranked you don't want to admit that you might belong there. If you are high ranked you don't want to admit that you are there because they want to believe it was their own skill and hard work that put them there. 

Another thing I adore is the people who say hey I made a new account and placed in Bronze, then worked my way all the way up to GM. Don't get me wrong, this is a feat and display of skill. But for every single one you hear about imagine how many have made an alt account, failed to rank up out of ELO Hell, and just stayed hush about it/called it a smurf account/troll account. It wouldn't make sense to complain about it since they have a high account and admitting to ELO Hell discredits their own skill. 

Another analogy that would be able to explain this is people's income. If you are someone who started out with middle class parents and managed to go to college, succeed, then get a well paying job out of the gate and continue to earn promotions to the point of reaching a 6 figure salary you would feel as though you have earned it. However someone who didn't get the opportunity to go to college and instead had to work right out of high school in a minimum wage job and is not making a lot of money later in life would feel stuck. This is similar to ELO Hell. By not being subjected to ELO Hell you get a greater possibility for success. However, if you are stuck in ELO Hell you will find an incredible difficulty escaping it. I say this as a gold player. I have seen several different ELO Hells. I would place them as 1900-2100. 2400-2600. If you escape those hells you are in a comfy position, but if you fall back into them they are incredibly difficult to climb out of. 

What all this sums up to is any player's ego. Players who are low rank will have an ego and feel that they are entitled to being a higher rank than they are. Whether or not they are performing well in their matches they feel stuck in an ELO Hell. Players with a high rank will have an ego as well and want to feel as though they are skillful and that their SR is a display of it.

 As this relates to the subreddit, when we see a post about an ELO Hell two people will chime in. The low rank player who wants a higher rank and has an egotistical reason to believe in it. The high rank has an egotistical reason to deny it. As such whenever one hears the other chime in they feel as though their own skill is being called into question. 

**TL;DR** Both high and low ranking players have a bias towards believing in ELO Hell or not. High rank players believe that they are truly skilled and that their SR is justified by their own skill and hard work. Low rank players believe that they are truly skilled and that their SR is unjustified and that they are stuck in an ELO Hell. This is because all players believe themselves to be high skilled due to their egos.  ",Overwatch

""What if they don't hit it"" isn't an argument because the ability is easier to land (and deals almost twice as much damage as) a headshot, which I think we can agree is a decent standard for the ability to reward accuracy with damage.

Which pretty much everybody would do, thus basically making it impossible to play as a group of 5, and having a negative impact on overall player sentiment. As a solo player myself with 800+ hours in the game, I can say that I almost never get placed with groups of more than 3 (even groups of 3 are pretty rare), and even in the very rare 5 stack game, it's not like it's THAT bad. Usually the team has more coordination and you can try to play around them for a decent experience.

Once you accept your SR is meaningless, and that all the ranking is essentially meaningless, you can start to actually have fun with it.  The truth is, because Overwatch is a team game, the SR will never be truly accurate; you could theoretically be in Bronze just because of pure bad luck (although I will concede it's pretty unlikely).  

I haven't even gotten into the throwers, the griefers, and all the other problematic players currently infesting Overwatch Competitive.

I had several weather related crashes in a row last season and panicked after I got an 8 hours ban.

If the winners get 1 point, then there's a reason to play this mode, but not too much. Players that are willing to gamble their SR should get higher rewards for winning.

In its most general form, a nipple is a structure from which a fluid emanates. More specifically, it is the projection on the breasts or udder of a mammal by which, in females, breast milk is delivered to a mother's young. In this sense, it is often called a teat, especially when referring to non-humans, and the medical term is papilla. A breast or nipple is sometimes called a ""pap"".

Oh yeah, they just made one of the biggest successes of the genre, which continues to rise in size and popularity. Totally just effective ""on paper"" rather than in reality.

&gt; The current problem in Overwatch is the lack of team play and the impact of even one person not contributing is too high.

Like I said, they've tested this stuff already. 6 is the magic number of personal responsibility and team play, and the wild, continued popularity of the game supports that.

&gt;But the reality is the team play isn't emphasized enough especially in QP and comp.

Here's the problem with your reasoning: *it's the same for the enemy team.* The only difference between your team and the enemy team is *you.* 
This balances the game out due to a certain law I'll mention later.

&gt;The atmosphere I see here with the ""any player can go up in rank if they're good""

Because it's true. You don't need to ""carry"" either for it. When you're good at your role, you drag up the efficiency of your team by some degree or another, which will cause you to rise in the ranks due to *the law of big numbers.*",Overwatch

25857,"because its on the same level as everyone else. Not above everyone, causing the team to shift focus from the 5 ground players to 1 air player that, if not retarded, can just dip and dive around or behind buildings. Shes not necessarily OP just not a fit for this game in any sense ",Overwatch
25861,"I had a similar idea. His numbers stay the same as they are now, except maybe a lower hook CD, but he has the option to charge his hook similar to OPs wind up idea. A fully charged hook does more initial hook damage to make a hook+shot combo a OHK to 200 HP heroes. A charged hook should take 2-3 seconds to even it out, make it loud and obvious,  and maybe make the CD 2 seconds longer. 

It should balance out where his weaker hook is used more often, but his charged hook is for more niche uses. You pull of a flanker from killing your healer with an uncharged faster hook, and finish off that tank who is focused on someone else with the charged hook.",Overwatch
25900,"Yes it's valid.

There is no such thing as optimal comp in Quickplay. People play whatever they want. You don't play Quickplay to win, you play to have fun and winning is a bonus. If winning is integral part of the fun (I know it is for a lot of people) then ranked is the way to go. That's the whole reason of it actually.",Overwatch

A team could easily carry someone with low raking the same way.

25989,"Not sure, I read the wiki and a guide on Doomfist and it doesn't say anything about that. But it doesn't help that the cracks and the explosion clearly reach Mercy. It could be simply that I was fooled by the animations and I don't understand the game mechanics, but the difference in height is so little that unless what we see is a bug, it's sloppy game design.

25996,"In general posititive changes for supports would be great.

More supports too, but more supports doesn't mean more healers, Sym being the obvious example. I don't think every support should be a healer, though the next support? Definitely be a healer, Blizzard.",Overwatch

26024,"Roadhog did protect his healers. It's what made him an option vs divecomp.

Roadhog had a massive close range presence that means you *cannot* ignore him. His damage and stun allowed him to murder flankers like genji or winston, and his presence alone could persuade people from going near his supports, and a Hog is generally positioned close to his supports. He can flank, but it's not somewhere he wants to be. I've won games by sitting on my supports with hog. 

Roadhog is a bodyguard and a murderer. His kit reflected that, because he's good at bodyguarding, and murdering. 

Also I wouldn't say Winston is particularly good at protecting. His bubble can help flankers when he dives but a huge part of it is just so that he doesn't instantly explode. He can sit on his supports, but unlike Roadhog, he wants to be diving into the enemy team to do his job. While Roadhog can contribute while being right next to his Mercy/Ana.",Overwatch

edit: If you're better than average, and every single other person in your game is intentionally throwing, i.e. walking off the cliffs, you get a free win cause you can just sit on payload. This is an extreme example, and of course you have to do a bit more if people are just being toxic, but climbing is not that hard IF you're actually better than the tier you're in. Why do you think good players have little to no issues climbing out of shit tiers.",Overwatch
26447,"IMHO, the current bastion is a husk of the hero. They removed the ability to score headshots and have a decent spread, which was a reward for good aim after utilizing his element of surprise. That's all bastion had, and now playing bastion in sentry mode is very impractical (that's right, I'm saying recon is better than sentry because recon rewards aim better than sentry).

Yeah, we'll 'think' our way around that one lol. Hook, sure, you could outthink that, scatter arrow is just kinda janky.

The ability is cool, and fun, but I totally get why people don't like it and don't feel that it fits within the rest of the game.  It's very very high reward with basically no risk and also feels pretty random a lot of the time.",Overwatch

The issue with this is that you're superscripting the Closed-Bracket, which simply makes it smaller!

26723,"The only issue here is that your rating is artificially raised as you play more games and as the season goes on. This is to give players the feeling of 'progress' through ranks. It is reset at the start of every season, thus why many of the most prolific players end up down a bunch of points at the start of a new season.

That means since you play 2.5 times more on weekdays, you're going to see gradual rank inflation. Add some standard deviation and a 600 point gap isn't unreasonable.

You're also not taking into account human factors. You already had a suspicion that weekends were worse. You may be tilting yourself or trying less because of lowered expectations of weekend teams. The weekend account appears to be your 'smurf' account so you may be subconsciously playing less intensely. ",Overwatch

And as a Widowmaker main, it isn't easy to climb ranks. Especially when you are bombarded by toxic players, people who leave the game if they aren't screaming into microphones about how I straight out fucked over my team, and when every single move you make and shot you take is scrutinized by your team, who you attempt to communicate to because you want to win. I know if I mained a different hero, I'd not get as much hate. But I wanna main Widow, and I will climb ranks as her and I have no problem with it. Just like I have no problem with your friends who are in similar situations as me and are higher level. 

All I ask is that you don't act like my low placement is directly related to my lack of understanding of the current meta. I know we are in dive comp, and I've found ways to work around it. My problem is it takes time for me to get warmed up and to get my aim down, I have a 9 month old brother, friends that are barely ever online, and am best playing as the character that gets flamed to death by toxicity.

So they don't make the decision on which class would be getting a new hero. It's about which hero is already far enough along. I'd much rather get a new offense hero now then wait to get a support and then wait more for the offense hero.

-The amount of characters in a category by no means establishes which category gets an update next. There are several heroes that have just now become viable with the release of Doomfist.

27424,"Why do you think esport was born in the first place? It was because players wanted to their game to another level. They wanted to play against each other, find out who's the best player, the best team and do it with their own rules. Ultimately, they formed small clans and over time they became a bigger and bigger community of competitive players who wanted to find out who's the best. People knew eachother, played with eachother, looked up to eachother and other people looked up to them. I was part of such a community back then, albeit in a rather small game, but it lead to me having to play competitive games ever since, otherwise gaming would just not be fun. That is still the case, although money is indeed involved in the whole thing since esports gained mainstream traction, but it's still the purest form of competition out there. It's not about making money with it, although I'd like to if I was good enough, but I have other obligations in life. It's about there being something that isn't just the ladder which is flawed in itself. I want to be part of a team that plays against other teams to find out who is better and I want to watch other teams do that as well. Ladder, while being high up there is a good goal to have, shouldn't be the highest thing you can accomplish because it's flawed. The purest and most fun form of competitive Overwatch is teams that have been together for months or years playing against eachother in front of spectators, and that's what it means to have an esports scene. Doesn't mean that there has to be money in it, although nowadays it probably does just due to how the industry developed.                     ",Overwatch

&gt;I know this is a very old thing for most people, but I think that the Hero Limit should be removed from QP or at least set to 2 or 3. Currently people are treating QP as competitive that doesn't actually give you SR or CP. When people are saying this game is dying, its because when you leave comp to play QP you are stuck with comp again. I remember when quick play was fun, you could go with teams of 6 hanzo's or like 3 lucio's and 3 symmetra's. It was always very fun, but ever since blizzcon 2016 it felt like a less competitive competitive. I wont really think that the hero limit should be totally removed but maybe like 2 or 3 hero limit. Make it so we can still have super crazy comps and such. The 1 hero limit in competitive is good. But quick play should get its old no hero limit back. I liked it in the arcade but when people play the arcade most go towards gamemodes like total mayhem or ctf and such. No limits did not seem very popular. But it was very fun. I played so many games with the craziest and weirdest comps. They were amazing and worked well. All of this stuff most of the player base wont remember. It seems like most people are newish, by meaning after blizzcon. I do have to say those people are missing out by not have playing it. Especially with the new hero, Doomfist, there wont be that rush to choose him. It will just be select who you want. Could there at least be something like how we had the pages like when you had the old pve events like junkenstiens revenge or uprising where you could select a difficulty, could there be a page like that where you can select a 1 hero limit or a no hero limit. It wouldn't really split the player base anymore because those people selecting no hero limit would have probably gone to the arcade, but being able to select it in a easier position would make it played more and more fun. Just like the custom game browser being moved to a easier to see place, it is being more popular. The same should happen with no limits or old qp. This probably is the least popular opinion in Overwatch, but I think it should be tested or at least thought about, the community needs somewhere where team comp doesn't really matter and you can just relax and play. Aracde is kinda used for that but not very much. Custom games COULD be used for this but I don't have 11 friends that want to do it and nobody really joins custom games like that. But I hope someone from blizzard looks at this and hopefully at least thinks about it. Love your game. &lt;3

He uses his wealth and connections to build a unique omnic with incredible powers to heal and defend others. However altruistic the gesture, his vanity runs true and in his final days, he insists that the scientists give the new creation his voice, his personality matrix.

Keep kicking butt with Orisa!",Overwatch
28755,"&gt; Speaking of D.Va the only reason she's ever picked is Defense Matrix.

DM is her biggest strength, but not her only boon. She's a flex tank that is compatible with point tanks. In the current dive setup, she does a mix of damage dealing with Winston and acting as a check to Pharah, Soldier, McCree, Reaper, and so on. She's bulky and is strong at claiming high ground from characters that depend on that positioning. It's why the better players you see do a mix of playing defensively and aggressively.

Likewise, Tracer's entire kit and attributes completes her, not Just Blink, despite it being her most valued ability. Blink gives her a strong neutral, while Recall gives her a limited amount of self-sustainability and Pulsebomb fits her fast-paced playstyle, being effective at discreetly killing healers or wounding tanks. Roadhog, however, had all his attributes loaded into offense, particularly getting quick picks off key targets. His weapon was slow, had a low magazine, and, being a shotgun-based weapon, means his damage is inconsistent and limited in range.

On paper, his hook is still valuable for displacing targets, but the problem arises when he hooks targets that survive and can disengage. When you have a pool of characters with as much potential as tanks, there's a lot more competition and players are more likely to opt for tanks that are either self-sufficient or more consistent.

In order to fit in, Roadhog will need to be stronger without his hook, and the RoF/Mag size changes to Scrap Gun are a start. If he's able to better perform outside landing hooks, he'll be more consistent, as missing that hook won't leave him completely gimped. As it stands, he'll probably need more love, but his adjustments ""make sense"", at the very least.",Overwatch

Edit: Also don't worry about all the trolls and assholes being trolls and assholes. That's what they do. Especially at lower ranks. It does get better, but not much. Another bit of advice is to find a group of people to play with, as it 1) is easier to communicate and play as a team and 2) reduces the likeliness of having asshole ransoms on your team flame you for not being very good.

Part of the reason pro sports can be broadcast the way they are is because there aren't really any obstacles to obstruct view other than players, and the fields are generally pretty easy to see things on. Overwatch can't run like that, which is why they also follow individual players. The problem with that is that we can only follow who the casters decide they're going to follow, which isn't really great. Maybe I want to see how the Sombra's setting up for a push, and how she's sneaking past everyone - it's not action-packed, so they're not going to follow it, but as a Sombra player myself those things are interesting to me. 

We should be able to watch through the Battle.net client if we want to be able to follow whichever players we want.

31693,"I seriously suggest giving jake's articles a read, they're extremely well written, well sourced, and present a pretty unique take on different OW topics.

On to the main topic, one tricking will provide better performance statwise, but does not guarantee more wins. If a team is full of dps one tricks that can't or won't play heals or tanks, on average, they would lose to a team of flex players that can build a solid comp.

The advantage of flex players is better access to counters. I'm a Pharah main, if I run up against a team that has no experience on soldier or mccree, I'm a happy camper. But if the other team has even a decent flex on soldier, coupled with a zen, i'm not gonna have a fun time. On the other hand, if the DPS slots are full and I'm playing heals or tank, I perform much worse.

Overwatch is very much built around counter-picking and team play, and OTPs, by nature, are weaker at these than flex players.

Anecdotal evidence doesn't prove much, I essentially one trick [Pharah](https://www.overbuff.com/players/pc/nevillelin-1622/heroes/pharah?mode=competitive), with above average stats in most categories, and I've been climbing pretty consistently (haven't had a huge amount of time for comp in the last few weeks though).

The point is that the initial damage and the stun are separate so you can not take the initial damage but still be stunned by the after effect, that shit happens to me all the time. Showing you took damage on the shield doesn't prove you didn't drop it.

It's not unacceptable, its pretty reasonable when you are trying to optimise a win. Though I'm sure there are people that rage about someone picking a sub 50% win rate hero and demand they swap, and yeah that's a bit rude and just gets the player to either throw or never switch if they cant play the hero to the level they intended when they picked it.

So many people including me consider it to be outright throwing to pick Ana, and while I'm tolerant of any character picks anyone makes, be it Sombra, Genji, or Junkrat, the one thing that will not fucking fly with me is an ally picking Ana.

In all honesty people on PC probably refuse to have a nerf but I'd be more than glad for Mercy to get nerfed or reworked so that every game doesn't boil down to who gets more resurrections.",Overwatch

I get matched vs a ton of golds/plats in QP every week. Some of them have very very good games and land some nice shots.

32284,"Its very annoying that developers have to ""fix"" this. The cool down and sleep timer is fine and not over powered but because people abuse it, its gonna be nerfed. Then you will have people posting on here saying ""Ana is unusable now, the nerf has killed her pick rate""",Overwatch

People tend to feel strongly about something when they've spent money on it.

One of the major points is that this is not a level field to begin with.  Blizzard takes in over a billion dollars a year.  Everything is stacked in their favor.

&gt; And the people who feel they've been wronged are shutting down opposition by labeling them ""fanboys"". 

It seems an apt term for people who mindlessly defend the anti-customer practices of a billion-dollar corporation that has its own legal and PR departments, people who cannot distinguish criticism of a *game* or a *company* from *the people who play the game made by the company*, thinking that any criticism of Blizzard is a criticism of themselves, personally, who then react emotionally with personal attacks against the OP, who in no way criticized the fanboy.

&gt; The extent of self-entitledness here is extremely prohibitive to any constructive discussion.

This ""entitledness"" theme is a cop-out, a way to avoid actual discussion by insulting everyone on the other side of the issue.  It indicates that the one using the term is unable or unwilling to debate the points of the issue.

33865,"This is a really short clip, so it's impossible to say whether you have good aim or not in general. But, we'll work with what we have-- let's go through every single shot! We'll look at what it was, how you did it, and what we can glean from it.

* ***headshot*** on Rein - video starts here - You hit him right as he begins his charge, so he's pretty much standing still.
* **bodyshot** on Rein - flicked, low charge - Since he's charging, you know where he's going and how fast.
* *miss* Rein (hit car) - flicked and moved back - You hesitated for a second here. You start by predicting Rein, but then you waver left and flick to the right. It looks like you weren't sure whether you should keep going for the Reinhardt or go for the Soldier/Zen to his left? Since Rein had your teammate pinned, killing him before he hits the wall should have been your priority.
* **bodyshot** on Rein (kills him) - preaimed while unscoped, low charge and flick that continues to the right -  At this point, Rein already killed your Winston. If you haven't missed the prior shot, he'd still be alive. 
* ***headshot*** on Widow - preaimed while unscoped, reticle at head   height, strafed to line up shot - This was a good shot. You saw the other Widow's trail after she shot at you and used it to your advantage. You were also lucky that she strafed into your reticle, but your crosshair positioning is still what made that possible.
* *miss* Zen - flicked while strafing  - You tried to shoot where you thought he would be, which is good. Most of your time was also spent moving your focus from the top window to the left choke. You probably could have been a bit more patient with your aiming.
* *miss* Zen (already dead) - flicked again even though he was in the same general area - It was probably muscle memory from flicking, but there was no need to move your mouse as wildly as you did here. He died in a huge explosion though, so who knows if you would've hit him or not.
* *miss* Soldier - flicked, overshot to where he was, not where he was going to be - He was also jumping at the end of a sprint, not necessarily your fault.
* ***headshot*** on Torb - kept reticle at head(ish) height, reacted when he appeared - Really good shot. You knew they were going to be coming through that choke from spawn. It's kind of lucky that it was Torb, since anyone else would've been a bodyshot. But still good game sense and reaction time.
* **????shot** on Soldier - ??? - It's hard to tell since the visuals stop here, but it sounds like you killed the Soldier as he was hacked and running away? 

Just based on this clip alone, I'd say:

* Your reactive aiming can use some work. 
* You're good at shooting things that are either standing more or less still (headshot on Rein, second bodyshot on Rein, headshot on Widow) or moving predictably (first bodyshot on Rein, headshot on Torb). I know how that sounds, but lots of people find even this difficult, so good job!
* It's hard to tell since this is such a short clip, but I think your game sense is pretty good. You know that Widow can do more work off the point when the enemy needs to contest it instead of you, you targeted the Rein while he was vulnerable (charging), you prioritized the enemy Widow as soon as she shot at you, you know that most enemies will have to walk through that choke and pre-aimed accordingly. The only thing that could've been better game sense-wise was when you hesitated killing the Rein to save your Winston. It was a split second thing but that counts.

If you want to get better at aiming with hitscan, here are some resources:

* [Overwatchdojo's McCree Aim Drills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gosylYPQR6M) - this entire channel is great tbh

Note that both of the above were made before the custom games lobby was introduced. They're good for warming up before matches, but don't do them for hours every day. The training bots have predictable movement and weird hitboxes.

33902,"That was awesome dude... great read for any fan of Overwatch. You have amazing writing ability... keep this up! 

On another note, could you tie in Widowmaker's voice lines with the whole ""breathing augmentation"" part? Most would consider someone breathing as a alive. When Widowmaker talks about her killing (from the animated short ""Alive"") on Kings row, she says that she feels ""alive"". Maybe she had breathed rapidly (because she had killed someone successfully for her cause), giving the sensation of feeling alive. Just a thought.

Keep up the good work, my friend!",Overwatch
33913,"Thank you for posting this OP, I feel you. I shared this story in another thread today, but I want to post it again but in shorter version. 

I'm a good Pharah player, but frequently play Mercy because I like to be a team player and fill. As a result, Mercy ended up being my most played, with a ton of hours on Lucio too. I wanted to be a team player. It got to the point where my teammates in pre-game lobby would just assume I am picking Mercy and not pick a healer, forcing me into the role. After a night of frustrating losses where I only played Mercy, I started fighting back. I started not picking her and telling my teams, ""if you want a Mercy, someone else is going to have to play her"" and I stuck to Pharah, or D.Va if we needed a tank.

Like I said, I think I'm really good on Pharah (and D.Va too) but I rarely got the chance to shine as people wanted me on Mercy, or assumed my skill level of other heros was lacking. I still love Mercy, but I loved Mercy so much more when I wasn't feeling obligated to pick her. I also loved her so much more when she wasn't so meta, so for now, I'm trying to climb with other heros, but the stigma on Mercy mains really needs to stop. It's fueling further toxicity. People don't want to play support, then flame other people opting to play support with the most healing-oriented hero in the game is so laughable. You can never please everyone.",Overwatch

34179,"Nah man im not saying im a victim of the system and that my experience its ruined and that I can't play my characters when I want because toxicity bla bla bla nah, I mean it is annoying but that's it, the reason why I have fallen from diamond is another, my team is kind of rusty, yet all you say it's still true and applies we just need more training and improve our callouts yeah.

What im saying is, that in general, in the whole of the game, why to allow consistency of a character's kit to be more important than the skill of a player to use the character? Why should anyone must come to the point of saying: ""shit ok I'll stop doing what I like because we need to win, I'll go soldier""
What's ideal is: ""Shit im not being effective, I must change to a proper counter or, fuck it, let's just concentrate and play even better than I am""
There should not exist a general easy road that's what im saying, I know it us utopic but we should work towards it.",Overwatch

You're being a dick, asking for proof you know he can't provide. Maybe you're right and he's lying, but it's a known issue in many video games where off meta players get reported and banned by automated mechanisms. It's a lot more likely he's telling the truth as he knows it, imo. 

he's not even asking for a revoke of his ban, just that the issue be looked into. What if he's telling the truth and eventually it gets proven, will you feel bad at all?

34217,"I'm on console, so I don't normally have voice chat. But a couple of days ago, I was playing Total Mayhem &amp; the enemy team Winton was waving &amp; saying ""Hi"" through the door (We were on Hollywood). Mine &amp; the enemy team just spent the match dancing on the payload (they even let us win, which was really sweet of them), Ults went flying into the air, Primal Rage became a weird dance on a rooftop... And I had a massive smile on my face for the whole thing. Even recorded some of it. Me &amp; the enemy Junkrat became Junkbros &amp; kept using our RIP Tires at the same time (somehow), rolling them up walls &amp; making them crash into each other. Most of us added each other at the end of the match and three of us are even planning on going into Comp together. It was honestly one of my fave Overwatch experiences. Made my terrible Comp games that morning completely worth it. ",Overwatch

34345,"That's only one link, there's also frustration caused by loss streaks, low SR gains/high losses, individuals with short fuses who tilt after 1 lost fight, a bit of trolling, and an ineffective reporting system. People do get mad when teams don't follow meta comps, also when *they do* play meta comps. 

Most of it just comes from human nature. The need to protect one's self-esteem will often cause players to seek somebody to blame, as it's difficult to admit that we're part of the problem. If players learned to accept their faults and understand tilting doesn't do anything but make their hole deeper, we'd see less toxicity, but that's wishful thinking.",Overwatch
34348,"Not properly. Ideally the Orisa shield fills the choke. If it's doing that, you're wide open to Hanzo.",Overwatch

I never liked Golden Guns - they don't look particularly good, it's a lazy design that more often than not is inferior to the original skin, and most importantly, it adds unnecessary glare in the screen.

I got him. I died pretty quickly.

Then, a couple of weeks later, *the same exact goddamned scenario played out*. Except, I actually did pretty okay for like 5 minutes straight. Which is kinda torture, because I try to play a character as well as I can (rather than walking off of a cliff) but I also *really* didn't want to play Hanzo at the time. &gt;_&lt;",Overwatch
34498,"Well tbh I don't really care about Taimou's opinion. During triple tank meta people just fought out shield battles until a dps got picked and then the fight was over essentially. There was total hero worship for dps players. In this new meta strong tanks and strong supports can finally turn a fight (not saying dps can't anymore, they of course still can). My SR is pretty high, and it has been since season 3, I'm having more fun now than ever before.",Overwatch

35796,"It is called Quick Play because matchmaking is faster and games really have all sorts of skill levels within them. JK himself has talked about how the mode was intended for less time commitment, relegating Competitive Matches for the longer, higher stakes, matches. We already have a quick practice mode, a ""whatever mode"" (for people who don't even care about XP), and a competitive ladder. I raise an eyebrow at the notion that both QP and AG are the same thing, but people can't be bothered to keep the ""whatever"" attitude to just Anything Goes.",Overwatch

35852,"&gt;&gt; The majority of Overwatch players play Quick Play as their primary mode.

&gt; I'm sorry but I really think this a stupid statement by Jeff.
&gt; A) No one gives a shit about team comp or winning in QP

Take a second and step back to think about this. The **MAJORITY** of players play QP as their primary (in many cases only) mode. Imagine being a person who doesn't like comp and only plays QP. Would you really play game after game not giving a shit about winning? No, of course not. You try to win just like everyone else.

The idea that ""QP doesn't matter"" is something that *people who play comp* think, because to them it doesn't matter, it's the casual non-serious version of the ""real game"". But for someone who only plays QP, the sentence ""QP doesn't matter"" doesn't make sense, because to them **QP = Overwatch**. It would be like saying ""Overwatch doesn't matter, when I play Overwatch I don't care who wins or loses.""",Overwatch
35868,Instead of worrying so much on your rank just try to improve your gameplay and the sr will follow. Even try new heroes in quick play you might find someone you're good at and enjoy more than your current heroes you play!,Overwatch

36578,"Hanzo is one of my mains. I can see the frustration with scatter and I think there's a better solution out there, but TBH it really is his primary defensive tool for up close battles. While he's obviously not a close encounters character, he should have something to be able to use to protect at up close battles. 

I like this idea a lot but I feel it would take long time and a lot of coordination to use on a close battle enemy battle leaving that area defenseless. He doesn't have a lot of mobility like Genji so he can't get away as easily either. 

Possibly a variety of arrows you can choose from? A wider pack including scatter and your idea but only using one at a time, limiting scatter use as much? Maybe a nerf for distance with scatter too? He could still do full damage for his defense up close but you can't aim at the floor half a map away and one shot with Zarya anymore. It would reward more skill. Maybe compensate with a slight buff to encourage and reward skilled primary fire as well. 

Nice idea! ",Overwatch

Why hack a Zarya to remove her bubbles if your team won't make use of it during the few seconds you have? Sombra can deal good damage on her own, but not if the whole enemy team is suddenly focusing you because your team decided to back up after your hack.

The biggest issue, at least what I've noticed, is most people don't play Overwatch cooperatively. They play it as if each person is doing their own individual job and contributing to the team via killing the enemy team faster. Genji gets two picks, Zen managed to get one, now your snowballing the enemy team. But this doesn't mean you're working together to do any of that. You're just out playing the enemy team on personal levels.

Sombra is absolutely at her best when the team work with her and can coordinate to make use of her strong utility. Which most people simply aren't willing to do and, as a result, view Sombra as weak because of what little she offers on her own. 

Sombra is an absolute beast if her team are willing to work with her and not expect her to be a Tracer or Genji, who can mostly support themselves and don't need follow up damage to do good work. ",Overwatch

38423,"Yeah I get that, but that's what I'm talking about, climbing you hidden MMR faster than your real one is a trick to push your win rate down and stop you climbing too fast. You're games are getting harder before you've climbed to the rank, so eventually you're gonna hit that point of a loss streak and balance that win rate out. 

Then again, I guess the only difference would be if they didn't do that would be climbing to the same rank anyway - you just get the visible MMR /SR for it, before you start getting super tough games and losing.

If they both climbed at the same rate, you'd climb much faster because your games get harder equivalent to how much you climb, as it is if you get a good winstreak the system goes 'woah woah woah slow down bud', and sticks a few people higher skill than you on each team to try and get you to fuck up. Obviously if you persevere, you keep climbing, but it's a bit unfair IMO. I'm never a fan of this 'you have to beat people above your rank just to get your rank' systems. League does a simillar thing. Get your silver promos with a 70% win rate? 'enjoy playing with 3 gold ranked players on the enemy team sucker. Try again with a 50.2% win rate instead and we might not punish you for climbing as harshly'.

The other features they've promised to console like platform-specific balancing which aren't affected by other parties have been missing after the initial balance changes they made.

I believe to understand D.va you have to understand when to push and when to peel. It relies a lot around communication.

Winnie dictates when we go in for the attack and I dive in with him, if our Lucio gets in trouble I peel to help him or the dps fill or support fill etc. 

Only playing more will help you understand her, Dm management becomes easier to do the more you use her and the more you understand the game.

38655,"In OW (and more broadly in gaming) there are two main ways to handle shooting mechanically; you can have the shooter spawn a physical object when they shoot, which follows a defined path with a certain speed/trajectory/physics behavior; or you can use a technique where you essentially define a cone where the player is looking, and when they fire, the game picks a point in that cone and ""scans"" for what it hits (a player, a wall, nothing, et cetera) without actually spawning any physical object.

In practice, what this means is that heroes that use projectiles have to factor in travel time when they aim and lead their targets, where hitscan heroes can just point at the target and fire and be sure to hit. That makes them a little easier to to be effective with, and better at taking down heroes that move unpredictably, since they don't have to predict to hit.

HARD. especially because they do not have the bonus SR anymore. and that is when they bitch/complain about the player base or how ""you can never climb but you drop really fast""

38929,"&gt;Did you read what I was pointing out? People are declaring him trash and never actually having played him in that state!

because as if magically all the whining is from people who never played new hog. No...that simply is not the case.

I was a former roadhog main, and have a friend who was a former roadhog main, i looked at the numbers and gave his new iteration a good college try and found it to be quite shit. 

At the bare basics of your argument i agree that people should play new hog at least a little bit before they say one way or the other, but to think **all** of the bitching is from people who never played new hog is quite ignorant to be honest. 

&gt; You know what we call this shit? a goddamn bandwagon! People are deriding hog's current state because it's popular to do so, not because people have actually played him seriously themselves, and the few that do mostly have their core arguments in road not being as effective at being a solo flanker like he used to, which should never have been his role to begin with.

Um...no. Hog never was suppose to be a solo flanker but people will play the hero however way they want. 

Hog's main asset was a punishing combo that worked really well if your were out of position, guess what lower skilled players have in spades? shitty positioning. 

the few? you are discounting the people who actually played hog to a few just because it supports your argument? i legitimately do not have time to explained how flawed that is, but my god. 

I mean there really doesn't need to be a core argument. Hog got a slight damage nerf, ruined his combo and now the hero is trash tier. You can see it very clearly he was not broken, and hasn't been for a long time. A slight damage nerf does not revert all the shitty things people were saying, because they were completely unfounded. 

people died to him and got made because rather than think it had to do with their skill level the hero **must** be op. *whew, almost got better at the game for a second there...fuck roadhog his hook is op*. 

the hook combo had way to many downsides to consider it Op, this change was very kneejerk is the bottom line. It honestly wouldn't be a bandwagon circle jerk if people actually looked up/played before talking all sorts of shit. 

&gt;lso, your excuse is BS in any case. Go practice him in QP, 3v3 or even against bots.

Because practice will change a damage nerf.... Sometimes there is no amount of skill that can change a hero, if they are shitty they will be shitty. 

No other hero needs to supplement their damage as much as hog does now, seems rather evident you don't play him either so i would recommend stepping off the high horse. 

It takes a game or two to really see how useless hog is. he is an ult battery, i used to fear hog but now i am happy when i see him on the enemy team. i call it out ""they have a hog, shoot him up that is an ult battery""

I recommend people play for themselves but roadhog is useless since the only thing he was going to get used for was taken away.

42342,"1. if you play s76 already, maybe try mccree since he is a hitscan character as well. For tank, I think winston and rein will be pretty easy to pick up. You don't necessarily have to pick up any defense heroes if you are good with soldier and mccree. But you can try them out and see if you feel comfortable with any of them. For support, mercy is really strong nowadays, as well as zen.

2. Roadhog is really unpopular these days. His overall DPS is similar to pre-nerf, but his hook-one-shot kill potential has been hit pretty badly. He is now more of a utility tank guy who pulls in enemies so that your teammates can jump on them. 

3. Ana used to be a fantastic healer, but her healing potential has been nerfed a bit. She is still great in the right hands and can solo heal if need be. And her grenade is such a good skill even after nerf. The ability to block healing for enemy teams can change teamfight results easily. Sombra is in a great place right now. She fills in a secondary support role where she helps her team heal through hacked healthpacks, and her ult is the best teamfight initiating skill in the game. ",Overwatch

42866,"&gt; I haven't seen that many ideas about how to address it

There's been **a lot** of discussion, but due to a lack of feedback from Blizzard (both through channels like the forums / Reddit, and in-game as a response to player reports) we have no idea what's possible, and if any actions are being taken (or will be taken) against people.

It's clear that throwing is a big problem, especially this season, and something needs to change to make it far more heavily disincentivised.

As I see it, you can't rely on player reports alone to punish people, otherwise any off-meta picks would result in severe consequences for someone who might legitimately be contributing to the team - so any changes have to incorporate some level of 'behind the scenes' analysis.

Based on the data that Blizzard collects (visible on the PlayOverwatch site and on third-party stat trackers), it should be possible to calculate if a player's score per minute is far below expectations for the current combination of hero, map, and Competitive tier. If that falls below a specified threshold - like if they deal no damage or gain zero / very low score per minute, yet have a very high number of deaths from jumping off the map or deliberately feeding the enemy team - then the account should be flagged and matched against any reports from that game accusing them of throwing. If there's a correlation across a number of games, that account should either be issued with a temporary Competitive ban, or placed into a low-priority matchmaking queue alongside people with a high proportion of mid-game disconnects.

The only way out of that queue should be to complete a certain number of games (perhaps backfilling for comp games where one or more players have dropped out) and for the duration of being in that division, the player would gain no XP, CP, or SR.

Of course, this kind of thing might be impossible to implement due to back-end code - hence my first pint about a lack of communication...",Overwatch

43415,"&gt; What doesn't agree with me is the explosion. If Reyes planned it, he shouldn't have got caught up in it. Did Talon change the plans? Did they figure they'd kill two birds with one stone and let Reyes die too? Did Reyes have a change of heart and try to save Morrison? He seems filles with hatred too much for that to be the case.

That Explosion... I don't trust that information. I mean, it comes from a blog like, ingame blog post from a seemingly pretty biased source. 
And like ""Their fighting caused an Explosion."" 
That doesn't make sense. Did they accidentally turn on the gas stove? Did one of them punch the water boiler?

This is the most important moment, maybe, in both their lives. It turned Gabriel into Reaper and Jack into Soldier 76 and we know virtually *nothing* about it. 
Did Gabe already have that ability to turn himself into nanite smoke? If not: How did he get it? Who gave it to him? Talon? But then, how can Reaper have been sighted for decades when the explosion happened about 5 years ago?
What made him so bitter about Overwatch? Was he maybe brainwashed like Widowmaker?

And why is Jack so jaded? Why would he looking for the people responsible for the fall of Overwatch if he *knew* that it was Gabriel?

Did Gabe let Jesse go or even tell him to get out? How the hell did Jesse McCree rack up a 6 Mill bounty? What about Genji?

What role did Mercy play? THere is a voiceline ingame that insinuates she should know what happened to Reaper?

And so on. 

But the most important is the explosion and the question did he or did he not?

Because if Reaper did not, then who did and why was Gabriel caught in it?
Maybe he DID go back and tried to save Jack and heck, maybe even succeeded. He sure as hell didn't seem surprised to see him in Egypt. So what if he saved Jack and Jack as usual got the preferential treatment, got saved and taken care of (who saved Jack?) and Gabriel got left behind to die.

43829,"&gt; Oh really? so 33% reduction is not gutted? Isn't that what happened to hog's dmg?

In the specific case of Roadhog, yes, it hurt a lot.

In the case of Doomfist being able to catapult himself across the map in a matter of seconds when that was clearly not what was intended (especially with how fast the nerf came, not even leaving PTR before being hit), is not. You can still launch yourself 40m on a 4sec cooldown by just holding space on a full rocket fist charge.

&gt;Also, im 90% sure you mean he felt better to play against, cause no hero feels better after a nerf, you just got better luck in those few games you played if thats so. 

No, I mean he genuinely felt better post-nerf. Much more controlled, much less ""I'm gonna launch myself into the abyss now"".

I agree he's easy to counter, but that was the case pre-nerf. It's no easier to counter post-nerf. The ~9m shorter range on a full charge means almost nothing when all you had (and have) to do is shoot at his huge hitbox. Flying around like Genji on steroids in 'Total Mayhem' is ridiculous.

It's not even a third of his mobility like you keep saying. ~9m is close to a third of ONE of his abilities, yes, but you can make it another ~24m with his other abilities. And if you hold jump while charging, you can easily make 40 on a charge.

Previous full charge: 30m

Jump-skip: +20m

Shift+E combo: +24m

Total: 74m

9m off 74m is not a crippling, gutting nerf. It's a much-deserved, and probably previously planned change. You can still go 65m with a combo of all three, on a ~7sec cooldown.",Overwatch

&gt;&gt;We are constantly improving the matchmaker. We learn more each day. We have one of our best engineers and best designers full time dedicated to the system. Many of those “silent” patches that go out during the week are adjustments to the system. For example, we recently realized that “Avoid this player” was wreaking havoc on matchmaking. One of the best Widowmaker players in the world complained to us about long queue times. We looked into it and found that hundreds of other players had avoided him (he’s a nice guy – they avoided him because they did not want to play against him, not because of misbehavior). The end result was that it took him an extremely long time to find a match. The worst part was, by the time he finally got a match, he had been waiting so long that the system had “opened up” to lower skill players. Now one of the best Widowmaker players was facing off against players at a lower skill level. As a result, we’ve disabled the Avoid system (the UI will go away in an upcoming patch). The system was designed with the best intent. But the results were pretty disastrous.

&gt;Great post, ExcaliburZ. Allow me to share some of my personal thoughts on matchmaking...

&gt;

&gt;We’ve been following all of the discussion around matchmaking. When topics get discussed in the community (and often among game developers) we tend to talk about things in very black/white or right/wrong terms. But most important decisions you make as a game developer are difficult trade-off decisions with no perfect answer.

&gt;

&gt;The goal of the matchmaking is to make it so that you as a player do not have to find 11 other people to play with. You can click a Play button, and the system finds other players for you. That’s the basics. The reality is, the matchmaker is extremely complex in what it is trying to do. It does way more than I am going to mention in this post so while I am going to offer some information here, I am leaving some things out (not all intentionally – it’s just a really complex system).

&gt;

&gt;At a most basic level, the matchmaker is trying to put you with 11 other people. But it doesn’t just randomly select 11 people. It takes into account a number of factors (more than I am going to list and not necessarily prioritized).

&gt;

&gt;The first factor is time. The matchmaker will try to find you match quickly and not force you to wait too long. A very common thing that happens is that a player will become dissatisfied with a match and say “I don’t care how long you make me wait. I’d rather wait 20 minutes and have a good match than get matchmade into a match like you just put me into.” What we’ve seen is that when the time crosses a certain threshold, players begin to complain about it taking too long to find a match. It sounds good… waiting for that perfect match. But when the reality of waiting too long comes down on most people, they end up vocalizing their discontent on the forums. Also, there is an unrealistic expectation that if a player waits longer for a match, the “better” the match will be. The concept of “better” when it comes to matchmaking is a really hard one to define.

&gt;

&gt;If I were to summarize match results into 5 broad buckets it would be these:

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;1.       My team won. We beat the other team by a long shot.

&gt;

&gt;2.       My team barely won.

&gt;

&gt;3.       My team barely lost.

&gt;

&gt;4.       My team lost. We lost by a long shot. It wasn’t even close

&gt;

&gt;5.       It was a broken match somehow. Maybe someone disconnected, was screwing around or we played with fewer than 12 people.

&gt;

&gt;(of course there are more cases than this – I am overly simplifying here)

&gt;

&gt;Most players will say that they want a match to be either type 2 or type 3 as I described above. Those sound even. Barely win or barely lose. But I believe when psychology comes into play, most players actually expect type 1 or type 2 to be the result. Even an amazingly close type 3 match can turn into a highly negative experience for a lot of players. And if you keep “barely losing” it’s not a very fun night. Winning is fun and good. Losing is less fun than winning.

&gt;

&gt;So waiting a really long time to lose by a long shot is obviously not good. But waiting a really long time to barely lose is also a negative experience. And if we assume that your chances of winning are 50%, that means that even waiting a really long time for a “better” match means that you’re going to wait a really long time to probably lose half the time… If your expectation was that you were going to wait a really long time for an awesome match where you either 1) Won by a long shot or 2) Barely won… but still won nonetheless, your expectations for what the system can or should do are in the wrong place. We do not generate bots to take losses so you can win more than 50% of the time. Those are real people losing on the other end of every loss you take.

&gt;

&gt;A second factor we take into account is ping. We’re matchmaking people all over the world and we want to match people to the closest servers for the best play experience. In our second stress test, we had other things prioritized over ping-based matchmaking such as skill and time. For those of you who participated in that stress test, you’ll remember how terrible the game performance was on the first day as well as how “lit up” the forums were demanding that players be given an option of server choice. So now we prioritize ping for players. Some players live in challenging parts of the world when it comes to high speed data connections (I’m looking at you, Andes mountain range…) so it’s not perfect for everyone. But largely, most people get a really decent connection to our game servers. Matching players with wildly disparate pings also results in a higher frequency of undesirable side effects such as “getting shot behind walls”. Of course if you live in Houston, Texas and group with your buddy in Geneva, Switzerland, you’re now introducing uncertainty to our system that’s harder for us to deal with… but we allow it.

&gt;

&gt;Which brings us to the next factor that we match on: grouping. The majority of our matches are comprised of either all solo players or solo players and players grouped with one other person. However, the system does try to match groups of equal sizes together first and foremost. As the time people wait grows, we expand the search to try to find others for them to play with. This means that occasionally we will match groups with players who are not grouped or in a group size that is smaller than their own. Like I mentioned, this is exceedingly rare but can happen. And that match is only made when players have crossed a waiting threshold that we deem too long. For most group matches a group of 6 is placed against another group of 6.

&gt;

&gt;Groups are a big challenge in our matchmaking system. You can group with people of wildly varying skill and ping and we allow you to. It’s pretty unlikely that there is another group in the queue that exactly mirrors the unique circumstances that you have set up (pings, skills etc.).  We want you to group. We feel that it’s the best way to play the game. So we try to avoid things that discourage grouping and we want to continually improve the social systems so that you’ll find it easier and easier to group with people you have chosen to play with. Playing with people you choose to play with is going to be more reliably fun than playing with people we choose for you. I once used the analogy of hanging out with people on a Saturday night. If you were to go out with five of your friends it would probably be a better time than if we tried to find 5 random people for you to go out with, no matter how smart we were in our selection process…

&gt;

&gt;Anyway, this leads me to matchmaking rating. This rating is the most important thing that we try to match on. Basically this rating means “how good are you?” Commonly, you’ll hear this referred to as Matchmaking Rating or MMR. MMR is derived differently in different games. Overwatch borrows a lot of knowledge from other games but also does a lot of things unique to Overwatch. As each player plays games, their matchmaking rating goes up or down depending on if they win or lose. The system is extremely complicated and there is a lot more going on here than I am going to spell out. So please don’t take this as the comprehensive guide to how MMR is calculated in Overwatch. There is definitely a lot more going on under the hood.

The Major from last week was the most viewed CSGO Major to date.

Here are the detailed stats for [Krakow](https://esc.watch/tournaments/csgo/pgl-major-krakow-2017) (last weeks Major), and [ELeague](https://esc.watch/tournaments/csgo/eleague-major-2017) (previous one, in January)

And before you say ""See the Final match was more popular last time..."" This major was a huge upset, the two teams in the final were not fan favorites, they weren't big name teams and a lot of people were salty with the upsets (lost them the chance at the golden pick'em challenge trophy), so people didn't care as much.

46234,"&gt; no idea where the shit people got the skins thing from.

The place people got it from is the fact that your original post is extremely short and incredibly vague. I had no idea what had a ""rectangular hitbox"" and why this made you "":&lt;""",Overwatch
46270,"I get where you're coming from- talking about how in a hero shooter, a character should be expectes to adhere to their assigned class. Tanks should be hardy and be less inclined to put out meningful DPS. 

However, Overwatch is also a game where some DPS's can heal/help heal and where some support heroes can pull off major plays that have nothing to do with how well they heal. 

What I'm trying to say is that Roadhog's *was* a bit much before the rework. But it wasn't because the combo could 1 shot. Disregarding the ways you could bait or block the hook, it was the fact that 1 shot was almost always garenteed with little hope of countering the second you got hooked. Sometimes, maybe the Hog player might shoot a bit off, leaving you with little health, and you got a chance to retaliate. But the Hog would normally have enough health to plow through the rest of your health. 

As he stands now, Roadhog is too much of a liability to be on a competitive team due to the way he feeds enemy ult. And making him ""more of a tank"" would only just rekt his play style and theme and might actually make him worse if the enemy is able to farm him even more for that tankiness. 

My idea for a new passive would hopefully discourage enemies to damage roadhog similar to Zarya's barriers in fear of just making the Roadhog strong enough for him to 1 shot combo. At the same time, that strength would have a weakness in that it would only be available when hog is relatively low on  health, so if the hog can't make picks soon, he'll probably die.

And who knows? My idea might not be the best. But, I'd like to think that it could possibly give someone another idea of their own so that this community can help smooth out this games edges.",Overwatch

Not trying to criticize you personally but this is why it's not as simple a problem as it appears.",Overwatch
46289,"Because his ability to one-shot a large amount of the game's cast encouraged the behaviour of flanking and acting like an assassin as roadhog. It was toxic and not what the designers wanted for him. If you're with your team and land a hook, they'll probably still die from being out of position. His whole gimmick is zoning characters with the threat of stopping their movement and outright killing them, that's his role as a tank. A threatening presence to protect his low health teammates from genji/tracer/reaper/winston/what have you.

I know that's not a popular opinion for what he should be, judging by the number of people who ""mained"" him up until the change, but I bet you they played him for the ""I'm going to run around the side of the battle and pull this mercy from right behind the Reinhardt"".

47610,"I completely disagree. 

Offense and Defense are very different roles with very different goals in mind. Offense heroes are built to get kills regardless of map or situation. Defense heroes are built to deny area. Defense heroes struggle on offense because it is harder to keep an area denied that is constantly moving. Widowmaker/Hanzo can't set up a killzone, bastion/torbjorn can't have turrets set up and waiting for the enemy. This is also the reason that professional players don't use defense heroes, why use a hero to deny an area when you can just use an offense hero and remove the enemy entirely? 

Symmetra is a support hero. She supports defenders, which is why a lot of players have a harder time pinning her down. Her turrets do very little on their own, but are much more potent when combined with a junkrat trap or mei to keep an enemy immobile. Her right-click projectile is very slow moving, but is a solid addition to the team when a Reinhardt or Orisa is blocking the sightlines of your Hanzo/Widow from getting kills.

Hanzo is supposed to be a cheeky sniper as well as a tank shredder. His headshot already was a clear oneshot. Scatter is supposed to oneshot squishies and threaten tanks seriously. Wether or not he should oneshotkill 400 health tanks with it, you can have your opinion on this. As a Zarya &amp; Orisa main I actually do not have a problem with that, considering the abilities these two characters have. But I also wouldnt mind Hanzo getting a redesign in general to be a little less nieche.  
  
Roadhog was a zone control meatbag dps tank. His role was: Walk into his area carelessly and he will oneshot you, approach carefully and you get to farm ult freely for a few seconds. Blizzard reconsidered because probably for the very casual players he was a pretty frustrating character to deal with, the loss of control, the oneshot, the heals, the tankiness and the teamfight ultimate, it FEELS like too much for some even when it maybe actually isnt. I am a little disappointed that Blizzard touched him without having a more clear role for him in mind, sure making him more of a dps and less wonky, thats fine, but he just doesnt feel that elegant right now.

Outside of unloading a fully loaded gun (165dps if the fire rate is approximately 1 per .4 seconds or 2.5 a second)  the continued fire as it regens is trash (~94.38 dps with the regen/fire time being .7) and his full reload time is 2.8 seconds to make his gun worth a damn again. 

It by no means needs a buff but still something to consider. It's only a little better than a support weapon (mercy 80 dps)

48191,"I think it's pretty clear what my argument was, but in case of confusion, let me restate it: the abilities have cooldowns not only because they are fun and high damage but because they are easier than the main weapons.  Nothing you posted actually countered my argument.  Landing a helix rocket is infinitely easier than landing four consecutive headshots, and landing a FtH on a close opponent is infinitely easier than landing two headshots.  Also your math is off, FtH is capable of a maximum 270 damage.  McCree can't do 270 damage with two headshots, even with a Mercy beam.
Abilities in this game were never meant to be difficult or highly skill -dependent, yet for some reason Hanzo is the one character in the game who should require a degree in mathematics to use correctly?  

&gt;Hanzo's ability is fired at the same rate as his other skills

Your initial post didn't mention anything about the fire rate of these abilities, so you're kind of changing your argument here.  Which is fine, I'm just pointing it out.  

&gt;It's bullshit, but it is the world we live in: period. Adapt until they nerf it.

The damage of scatter is balanced with the low consistent damage potential and difficulty inherent in using his Stormbow.  But even if you are too shortsighted to look at his abilities and balance in context of the character as a whole, I highly doubt they are going to nerf an underpowered hero with a low global kill rate and even lower winrates in competitive.  It would be counter-productive.  

Scatter gets a lot of tears, but in terms of ""statistical data"" Hanzo is a perfectly balanced character as is. 

I'm sure you would be surprised as how often scatter actually one-shots anyone.  Only Blizzard has those stats though.  We can assume though, since scatter has a ten second cooldown, and it's obviously so easy to land every arrow instantly - that Hanzos would average one guaranteed kill every ten seconds.  Yet that doesn't seem to be the case.  In fact, *statistically* speaking, Soldiers on average earn more kills a game from Helix than Hanzo does with Scatter.  Odd.  ",Overwatch

I'm hoping it's the start of a trend. I've been playing a lot of Total Mayhem lately and Sombra is incredibly common there. I think people are slowly catching on to how useful a silence is and how powerful EMP combos are. (Especially with Graviton Surge.)

That said, there's still a lot of misinformation going on about her. I used EMP right after an enemy Sound Barrier and the Lucio complained about the game glitching and not giving anyone the shields. Had to explain to him that EMP deletes shields and barriers.

(EDIT: To those who want to point out that Total Mayhem != quick play or competitive, yes, I know that, but Total Mayhem is pretty much the ideal environment to show off the utility of Sombra's hacks.

This is why I *love* Blizzard's design focus so much more than Riot Games.

They focus their game too much on competitive play and the majority of players are not in competitive.
Blizzard is doing the right thing.  The issue is that players are not used to having to work so hard to figure things out.  
&gt;I do not agree with the philosophy that we should just make balance changes solely to shift people off the meta


This, so much this.. Thank you Jeff.

52017,"Do you think having a mode that limited the players' hero choices would be less frustrating? That way you won't have to solo heal the Hanzo/Widow/Genji. 

That's how I feel anyway, and I think there are at least 3 ways Blizzard could do it. 

1. Mystery Heroes that nudges the team towards a 2-2-2. This was recently discussed by Jeff on the Overwatch forums so it seems within the realm of possibility. 

2. Quick Play except you can only lock 2-3 DPS maximum. Just like when someone has already locked Genji and now he's not selectable, if your teammates win the ""instalock a DPS"" race you will not be selecting a DPS this game. Having to race for the role you want to play might feel bad sometimes, but it would be better than the last person to pick always going Hanzo even though we have no healers. 

3. A mode where you queue as a role (healer/tank/DPS) and the matchmaking tries to assemble a passable team composition.  If you need to change heroes for countering reasons you can still do that, but you can only flex within your chosen role.  This would probably be the hardest to code which is why it isn't my first suggestion, but I know nothing. 

There are downsides to all of these ideas but it's better than what we have now.  It's really frustrating to see people treat Quick Play like it's Call of Duty and focus exclusively on getting those sick frags. There can be a mode for that too, but I don't want to play it.

I prefer the latter, only hiding when I can sense that someone is about to ult like zarya which for me, means split-second decision-making. ",Overwatch
52600,"It's not even that. Masters is flat out more coordinated and Grandmasters have extreme consistency. Seagull has practically always been in Grandmasters and doesn't know half of the shit that goes on in lower ranks, yet is pretty quick to judge in this video.

90% of the time I'll try my hardest to fill for a team role but even then our team cannot agree on a team composition, and this isn't regarding trolls, tilters, people who feed, waste ultimates, and people who flat out refuse to coordinate (doesn't wait for the team, etc.). 

In Gold and Platinum, you'll consistently have Junkrat and Genji against a Pharmercy when we need tanks or supports. Then it becomes a problem. Who's going to beat Pharmercy and support the team? People play this game like it's goddamn Destiny and tilt when things doesn't work. I've seen that in Grandmasters, if you even *attempted* to lock Junkrat or anyone that's really bad, you were instantly called out for throwing and everyone just picks their favorite character because they know they won't win. If anything, I've seen that some Grandmasters are less tolerant than people in Gold/Plat, which is pretty sad.",Overwatch

A few Things I found right off the bat:


&gt; ""Overwatch's short list of prospective agents included two members of the soldier enhancement program: Morrison and Gabriel Reyes, a senior officer. ""

Morrison and Reyes happened to be one of multiple enhanced soldiers Genji, for example, I thought he was just a normal guy who had some fancy omnic running boots made from the skins of his vanquished robotic enemies. Guess Mcree really is the only cool *normal* dude living off his own skills.


&gt;""Leadership of Overwatch fell to Reyes, but Morrison would have a greater impact on the group in the long term. He brought out the best in the people around him and helped mold Overwatch's diverse (and sometimes conflicting) agents into a cohesive fighting force""  ""The UN rewarded Morrison for his contributions by making him Overwatch's first official commander. Reyes was passed over in the process, and it created a rift between the two men that would lead to tragic consequences.""

**Here's the juicy bit,** Reyes was seemingly less fond of Morrison than I had believed, and several other instances praise Morrison, with anecdotal references of any accomplishments by Reyes. Imagine entering the military, only for the new guy, however likable he may be, to steal all the glory and  fame after you've been working hard and devoting your entire self to hard work and getting better. I would resent nearly anyone for that, and it wouldn't matter whether I was friendly with them, because at the core I would despise them for being everything I'm not.

&gt;""Two decades after Overwatch ended the Omnic Crisis and saved humanity, it was brought to its knees by a series of shocking allegations: negligence resulting in high-profile mission failures; corruption and mismanagement; weapons proliferation; human rights abuses; and more.""

&gt;""A special UN committee launched a lengthy and highly secretive investigation into the claims.""

&gt;""As the UN investigation proceeded, Overwatch's Swiss headquarters was destroyed in an apparent accident. Among the casualties were Morrison and Reyes.""

&gt;""After Morrison's promotion to strike commander, his relationship with Reyes changed,"" Dr. Angela Ziegler, medical director of Overwatch, stated during a UN committee hearing. ""The tension became more pronounced as time went on. I tried to mend things. We all did. Sometimes when the closest bonds break, all you can do is pray you stay out of the cross fire.""

So we were both right! There was certainly foul play, and they had ""the closest bonds"". Now that I've reread that all, I wish there were more instances of interaction between the two, as they are an excellent pair and deserve more fleshing out of their current feelings and beliefs. Guess I'll just have to wait for blizzard though. And after seeing the differences between their methods, with Reyes believing OverWatch and Blackwatch to be outside the law, and Morrison defending the image of Overwatch *Being* law (or at least an example of order, peace and general good).

53418,"First of all, I am a firm believer that elo hell **does** exist. That doesn't mean that I blame my teammates for everything they do and never look at myself. Both sides of this huge discussion / argument are completely wrong and I'm here to chime in with some references from actual sports that do have a sense of elo hell in them. In fact, anything competitive, whenever it be a game or a sport, is going to be the same in a ranking system such as this.

---

First off, some facts.

1: Elo Hell exists, but it is different for every one.
---

The reason that elo hell exists is separate from everyone because of every single factor of said human being participating in the competition. From their skill level, to how healthy they keep themselves, **everything** affects their game, and in turn, if they are stuck in a certain bracket. Personally, I've been living with depression my entire life. I've had certain circumstances that has shut me down from any competition in video games because I was unable to improve at them. **Until OW made me realize otherwise.** OW made me realize how **wrong** people were. How much of what was wrong with me was put in my face. Then, I simply turned to **fix what was wrong.**

2: Stylosa was right when he said ""Rank doesn't Matter."" It is not a meme.
---

SR, is... for all purposes, just a number blizzard assigned your account to match you properly and rank you, approximating your skill level. Sure, you can use this as a baseline for your skill, but skill isn't even a factor in which most athletes even worry about. Most athletes don't tell themselves how they need to be *x* good to do *y*, they tell themselves: ""I need to improve *x* amount so I can be sure I can do my best at *y*."" However, for some reason Stylosa's statement is treated as a meme, and it disgusts me.

3: The gaming competitive community is not as encouraging as the sports community.
---

In Sports, almost everyone is encouraging to push you to your limits. To make you do this and to motivate you to never give up. As a low-silver however, I've had several people, from top 500s to professionals in an actual OW professional team, be extremely elitist to me and tell me that my opinion does not matter, and that I need to be *this* rank to have any worth in this community. I'm sure someone out there will completely tell me off for this post because of my rank. This is also the reason I left /r/Overwatch official discord, aside from other personal reasons. Pros and even coaches do not 100% care for the people below them. Remember Seagull telling a donator: ""Get Gud."" at someone needing help that was in Elo Hell? It isn't elitist since he was in the middle of a comp match, but I would have said: ""It's complicated. Not now."" Sure, you see some of these pros actually post videos of how to improve mechanical gameplay and other things, but they never tell you how to **really** improve. How to actually improve as a human being, both mind and body, to **truly** *rank up*, not just in SR, but in yourself. *Put that on a card, hallmark.*

4: Improving is not about increasing your skill level.
---
Sounds really damn odd. I mean, skill does correlate to your rank, standing, and everything else, right? Look at sports. There are a lot of instances where small-time players who really want to get into this team as a **goal**, similar to reaching a certain SR number **goal**, don't make it at all. They say that they work 200%, get up early and shoot hoops before going to school, do everything in their power, blood, focus, and tears, to reach their goal, only to *fail*. But that's the point. **Failure is exactly what you want.** Of course, purposely failing won't teach you anything or make you improve, but if you play your best in an overwatch comp game, and lose. That doesn't mean you've gone farther from your *goal*. It just means you found a way that wouldn't get you to it. Or in the case of OW competitive, you found your mistakes that you need to fix to better yourself.

There's a lot more factoids, but I can't think of anymore.

---

The second part is this post I made in a DM with someone.


    A lot of people see Competitive as just... the end goal.
    To get top 500
    To get whatever number.
    I believed that too.
    Then I looked back at actual competitive sports and realized it's really not about that.
    It's about the journey.
    Edison once said that those who never failed, have never tried.
    Rocky Balboa himself quoted that it aint how hard you hit.
    It's how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.
    Same with overwatch. It's not about how good or skilled you are.
    It's about how you can face your loss at your skill level, then look at it, get up, and move forward with a smile to the next challenge.
    As well as learn from it.
    And recently from being motivated from Elliot's speech of how ""You're supposed to fail.""
    The SR system being completely rigged to make you have a higher chance of losing as you climb.
    Is exactly what it's supposed to do.
    When people just see it as a grind. As a number. As a goal. People tilt when they see it go farther from said goal.
    If I had to apply these quotes to overwatch, it would be this personal quote.
    ""It's not about how good or skilled you are. It's about how you can face your loss at your skill level, then look at it, get up, and move forward with a smile to the next challenge, as well as learn from it.""

*“I have not failed, not once.  I’ve discovered ten thousand ways that don’t work.”* ―Thomas Edison

*“Life's not about how hard of a hit you can give... it's about how many you can take, and still keep moving forward.”* ―Sylvester Stallone, Rocky Balboa

**""It's not about how good or skilled you are. It's about how you can face your loss at your skill level, then look at it, get up, and move forward with a smile to the next challenge, as well as learn from it.""** ―TheGandalf's Shameless Rocky Balboa OW Adaptation

I made a quote. Eat my shorts.

---

My personal addendum is this. I've been dealing with low silver for weeks now. I personally feel I'm slightly above that level, but I'm not aiming to prove I'm at that level. I'm aiming to improve. My **actual** SR will be above what the **SR System is actually telling me.** because I'm not aiming to bring it up. I'm aiming to improve my personal skill. SR will slowly go up naturally, and despite throwers, griefers, toxicity, or whatever. This SR system only looks at **you,** not your team. Only you can bring you down, theoretically. Not your team.

My best advice? **Mindset.** Acknowledge that the road ahead of you **will be a hard one.** Acknowledge that all the shit that comes with OW Competitive will hit you hard. If it doesn't, enjoy your easy top 500. Nobody will care but your loyal fans that kiss your boots. But me? And everyone else that's stuck down here? Everyone else that is being beaten and smacked around by this so called SR system and Elo Hell that you implore doesn't exist? We'll work our personal ass off and make your 500 a crowning fucking achievement. Everyone is different. You might have it easy, but **some of us have to go through literal hell just to reach SR 2000.**

Either way, once I become better then **you.** Better then **Stylosa.** Better then **Seagull.** All the way from the bottom with only the blood, sweat, and tears fueling me. The vengeance from your insults, your elitism, your will of keeping my mind chained to the bottom of this ladder empowering me to go further. The dedication that will never falter until my last dying breath. Then I'll be able to finally be the one to prove you wrong. And to prove to the people with the same situation as mine, that it's not only a hard road, but a possible one.

I would love to have a system that took into account your personal contribution to a win/loss but I think that trying and failing to judge personal impact is worse than just leaving it alone.

The system is trying to speed up this process by artificially nudging your SR in the direction it thinks you should go.  This is understandable as it has the potential to improve many players experience with the game taking away the necessity to grind out tons of games but it backfires quickly when it is doing its job poorly.

53762,A Junker symmetra and a Vishkar Junkrat would be a nice pair of skins to have,Overwatch
53769,Thanks for confirming exactly what I stated in my post. When people gain rank they want to believe it was due to their own skill and deny ELO Hell. ELO Hell is at odds with your ego therefore you deny it.,Overwatch
53774,"Im a masters player and have been for the past 3 seasons. My peak SR was 3994. Ive played my fair share of Rein since i tend to fill roles. This usually means i play supp, but i also play tank decently often esp with these mercy one-tricks floating around at high elo. 

He is bugged yes, if you took the time to read my posts you'll see this was the first thing i said.

While the bugs certainly dont help, this isnt the reason why he isnt meta right now. Even if all his bugs were fixed he still wouldnt be meta. 

He's out of meta atm for other reasons outside of Rein's balance - namely the strength of other characters right now that counter Rein. Dive is strong, and Anchor tanks like Rein and Orissa dont do well against Dive. Thats it. ",Overwatch

53939,No it would for sure reduce salt. Look how overwatch is compared to every other shooter with a scoreboard. Also did you not read what I wrote because I explained how. It would not make salt go away no one is saying that. Just turn it from salt every game to only salt if someone goes 0 and 20 with no healing or shielding. Some people need to hear that they didn't do anything. Where ow players blame anyone in the room but usually it's the worst player (who would never say anything if we saw his stats) complaining to the best player (who he wouldn't message if he saw his stats). Don't just argue everything on Reddit please read and try to understand that in no way can removing scoreboard in games make them less toxic overall.

Honestly, your first comment is an excellent example of this ""word diarrhea""you accuse me off.

This is literally what my last 2 games were like. Only player in comms and I pick healer. I notice I am the only healer working with 1 tank + 4 DPS.

If I show you a gold medal for ""damage blocked"" as the only tank, that... kinda doesn't mean much.

It should be a relative score, really.

Take ALL games played since the last patch. All leagues all over the selected region. If I'm in the bottom 33% I get bronze. Middle 33% I get silver. Top 33% I get gold. Very linear. You might want to not give a medal to anyone performing in the bottom 10%, and you might want to give a special medal to the top 10%, but that's it.

So we know blizzard are okay with kill combo's, the thing about doomfist is he has his trade offs (long charge time, glass cannon, reduced movement speed during charge) to justify his kill combo. Roadhog had a kill combo that needed 3 steps with the first being a skilled hook. Doom needs 1 step with the first being a skilled charge. So instead of tweaking road hogs trade offs, eg his healing (reduce amount, increase time ect), charge (increase hook wind up time before released ect), extra health pool (acts as ult charger) then instead removed the combo. Now they are thinking about tweaking his trade offs to match his reduced combo. Personally I think this is flawed logic, I believe it more that they made a mistake and wont revert the changes to save face so instead they are justifying the changes and increasing his healing. When personally I think with the introduction of doom fist they have admitted kill combo's are fine and instead should of rebalanced hog but kept the kill combo.",Overwatch

Since you can turn your computer on fine, I'm guessing it isn't that.

The reason phone-support IT wants you to restart the computer even when you say you already have isn't just because they're following a script - the beep the computer makes can alert them to different hardware faults.

* McCree is wandering a vigilante, last seen in Mexico

* Reaper is working as one of the leaders of Talon

* Soldier 76 is with Ana, last seen in Egypt.

* Mei (never was an agent) is... Mostly unknown, trying to save ecosystems and nature.

* Torb has been doing big things, such as stopping Sven in a fictional country I forgot the name of. He is currently with Bastion.

* Reinhardt is touring Europe with his mechanic/squire Brigitte

* Lucio is... Probably on a world tour? We dont know

* We also dont know what Symmetra or Zenyatta have been up to either.

I agree that this is a perfectly justifiable complaint, that we know nothing about what Overwatch and it's heroes are doing in the present, or that we know nothing about a large part of the cast aside from ""Oh they are wandering/defending something"". For Talon however, before Doomfist's launch and Masquerade, we knew next to nothing about them. Ana's comic and Sombra's short did not tell us much either, despite putting Talon in major roles for both. They were still more centralized around Ana/Jack and Sombra respectively. Masquerade has shed significant light on what Talon is, answering a few questions people had while also opening a lot of doors.

56797,"Maybe we shouldn't be able to see our stranger teammate's stats. What good does is it do when you've already been locked into a match? Nobody on my team should be trying to decide for me who I should play based on history. 

On a side note, I think it would be interesting if there were a system where you can select your ""current main(s) "" and it pairs you up with complementary teammates. Then, everyone gets to play what they want with a balanced comp. 

The thing that killed this game for me was the constant in-fighting. It's almost like road rage. People can't help themselves. 

And a big part of that rage might be because this is a game of counters, rather than teamwork. If everyone chose  1 character on the enemy team to counter, that team will win. But that's now how it should work. A good team build should be able to stand on its own against anything. And every combination of teams needs to be able to stand up on its own against anything.

Basically, when every possible combination is perfectly balanced, people will stop raging. But that's not how this game works. So people will rage on because their teamate won't pick an obvious counter and the rager can't change. 


People rage in this game more than I've ever had in any game. The game itself kind of is responsible, because the balancing is frustrating. ",Overwatch
56842,"Legitimately I was on a 14 game losing streak (not in one session) where I was just playing my best, contributing in voice-chat, and being cooperative.  No one on voice chat would ever *really* communicate or call out enemy locations/kills, or try to time ults.  I noticed this but I'm not the kind of player who wants to force other players to attack at a certain point. 
By game 15 I said screw it and started ordering my team around and saying ""we're going to do this now, can we switch here"" occasionally telling the team that they need to make call outs when they kill a key target (like killing a mercy in a pharmacy combo).  It turns out that I won that game, and I started doing this.  It doesn't work when the team doesn't listen or care, and I have *never* found someone who does something similar on my team.

Wow. Cumbersome. The 80s called, they want their langauge back.

&gt;Also, 'your entity'?

What is wrong with thinking on a higher level, on a different layer of abstraction. Exactly, you only think about yourself thus you will never see the big picture. I am the master of my own design.

&gt;Wait wait wait. So, you're saying that I shouldn't blindly believe what I'm told, but I should blindly believe that this guy is morally and intellectually superior because he's better at shooting things in a video game?

You should trust his judgement in that videogame yes, you should not follow his online cooking reicpes though. Is that so hard to grasp?

But after a number of high profile incidents, including the breach of a similarly top-secret facility in Egypt, those who have objected to the increased privatization of security following the shuttering of Overwatch will have been dismayed that Helix has requested, and been granted, additional funding by the UN to cope with rising threats.

I think this is another hint for a hero sometime after Doomfist. A few weeks ago there were unconfirmed rumors about a hero that could close of areas with portable shields which would fit perfectly into the narrative of capturing Doomfist by surrounding him with some light energy barriers.

If you like 2D metroidvania games, Shovel Knight is now fully complete and Hollow Knight is a brand new indie game thats amazing.

59310,I was looking at my phone 😭 and on KOTH maps it's defeat or win right after it doesn't say match complete so sometimes I get confused I guess this time I just really wasn't paying attention ,Overwatch

59388,"""Throwing slurs"" is a pretty vague use of the word when we're talking about a dude calling his bro ""nigga"" but sure hting champ.  

People who can't get over a word hurting their feelings are weak. People refusing to let others control them is not the same as being unable to not say a word.  

Feel free to ""define strawman,"" since that's all you Tumblrinas do anyway. Just go about redefining the language in your own terms to ""win,"" right? Redefine what racism is, redefine what gender is, etc.  

&gt; I can do the same back to you but  

In fact, you can't do the same to me. If I call my buddy ""nigga"" and you lose sleep at night due to your ""PTSD,"" that sucks to be you. But there's nothing you can say to me -- absolutely nothing -- that will hurt my feelings. Even if you knew everything about me and knew my real flaws/things I actively try to improve (hint: calling a buddy 'nigga' is not a flaw in my book) and tried to insult me with them, I'd just feel like ""Yeah he's right I really do need to work harder on that.""  

What else are you gonna do? Make fun of me by calling me white? Some of us actually don't give a shit about our skin color. I'm not proud or ashamed. I'm just what I am. Only pathetic people are still focusing on that garbage in 2017.",Overwatch

59667,"Reduce the amount rez rewards players. A lot of Mercy's simply hide and wait for rez, which is a crappy way to play the hero and a crappy way to treat a team in need of healing.

In most cases Mercy simply runs away when a fight happens, even if there was a really good chance your team would have won with heals, because she wants to survive and get a good rez. 

The current system rewards heavily for a rez. Reduce the amount of reward rez gives. ",Overwatch
59693,"&gt;It seems we have basically all the healers we might need.

I disagree, I think there's a lot of healer archetypes that could be added to OW.

So, what could be added? 



* A builder hero would be good for a start. Paladins has 2 of them. One (Grohk) deploys a healing field similar to S76's, so let's ignore that since that mechanic is already present in OW. The other one (Ying) deploys clones of herself that periodically heal the closest ally. The clones can also be detonated to damage enemies. Something something heal-bot summoning Omnic idea.

* Another one could be something like how Auriel works in HotS. For those that don't know, Auriel can burst heal an area every couple of seconds. The amount she heals for depends on a charge meter (think Zarya). So, Auriel chooses a champion (a teammate), all the damage that that ally does (as well as Auriel's own damage) charges her hope meter.

* Original idea! Put Ana's grenades in Junkrat's gun. Oh, and make them apply a heal over time (that doesn't stack) instead of burst healing. I'm taking about the healing part, not the anti-heal, of course.

* Then there's Paladins' Seris, who has very fun gameplay while having very simple healing mechanics. Her heal is pretty much Mercy's beam, channeled over 2-3 seconds, with a 5 second cooldown. Why would this be something you'd pick over Mercy if it was in Overwatch? Well, the heal could be stronger than Mercy's, if she was a main healer (so you get better value out of 1 heal, but have to pick your targets more carefully because of the CD). Or more power could be put into her offensive kit, and have her heal be something done on the side, kind of like Zenyatta, but that synergizes with deathball more than with dive. Seris, for example, has very good zone control. Here's some [gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su5oeaGcX2I) if you're interested.



And that's just healing supports. Torbjorn, Symmetra and Sombra are often overlooked in the support conversation, but their job is also to help their team perform better. There are plenty of effects available that could form the basis of a utility support; CC's like Blind (prevent use of primary and secondary fire) and Slow, or buffs like attack speed increases, or cleanses, or CC immunity etc.",Overwatch
59703,"Switch to Ana. Or switch to Reaper, take care of them, then Ana.

No reason to keep playing a hero if you're being countered",Overwatch

60101,"This part is the most relevant tho:

&gt; This is pretty close to what we're trying with him, and what will likely be on the PTR when it comes back up. Currently on our internal builds Junkrat has 2 charges of his Concussion Mine. This allows you to do all kinds of cool stuff like launch yourself into a fight and still have a charge to escape with, or launch yourself up into a Pharah and still have a charge to try and kill her with. Previously this was possible before but you had to plant one on the ground and then wait for the cooldown to come back before doing this. That is still possible, which allows for a triple jump now if you want/need that, but now it is a lot more reliable to do with 2. It has been a ton of fun to play with so far.
We're also looking at making his ult a bit better. We're experimenting with a movement speed increase or a health increase on the tire. We wouldn't do both things but in either case it should be more reliable to use in more situations.",Overwatch

I mean, if you look at their cross game content it's pretty much all within blizzard's system itself. This is part of the reason Blizzard picking up Destiny 2 was such a huge surprise. I'm not saying it's impossible, just rather unlikely. Stuff like Genji's sentai skin is more along the lines of a cultural tribute or something based around the character's origin (at least from what I can tell).

So if I want to get better at McCree for example I will try to shoot people as much as I can, challenge everyone as much as I can and dying. Does that mean I'm uncooperative? If I want to learn how to flank as Reaper and I keep sneaking around/teleporting behind enemies and dying all the time does that mean I'm uncooperative? If I want to learn how to pin people as Reinhardt and keep charging into enemies and dying does that mean I'm uncooperative?

You are definitely forcing rules on people by making them cooperate by your rules and your view of how to win the game. Not everyone needs to play like pros and pick by their meta. I can win by playing a ""deathmatch"" as you say and killing the whole enemy team by myself and a teammate Zen and capture the point. Does that mean we were the bad/uncooperative players and the other 4 in our team waiting outside to charge their ults were the correctly playing best teammates?

Gold elims could also mean you are just doing spray and pray, tapping things with 20 damage as they where gonna die anyway, I always get gold elims as D.va, but hardly can use it as a metric since if DM is down and i am assisting the DPS. Since I am more mobile then some I get to assist both dps with their kills effectively getting double the elims they can, while doing minimal damage.

Hog can almost kill Genji &amp; Tracer right now right? He hits his current combo on either and - more or less - they have to retreat or die to his second shot. Zen? He can't get away really after getting hooked regardless. By the way, his firing speed needed increasing.

So Hog is mainly used to counter other Dive Tanks. He didn't need the OHKO to stop D.Va and Winston. He just needed to do damage and fast. This is where I say upping his firing speed could work. D.Va and Winston take the first hit from the combo. Either they try to fight him, keeping them from attacking Hog's allies, or they have to flee or die to the next shots from his gun.

That way, Hog keeps his threat to dive folks, without needing the OHKO.

63928,Play a game like playerunknowns battlegrounds.  The aiming is so much harder in that game that coming back to overwatch makes aiming seem like child's play.  I too am a tank/healer cuz I can't aim...that isn't so true anymore sonce I started playing pubg.,Overwatch

In any competitive game where you gain and lose rating, people are going to want to win. It's not fun and doesn't feel good when you start dropping rating because someone else doesn't want to be a team player.

64268,"&gt; The new dive comp meta is hard to play 

lul 

""Everyone press shift at x target""
",Overwatch
64325,"Or maybe they should've left Quickplay as Quickplay instead of changing the entirety of the game that a lot of people enjoyed in favor of the competitive scene.

I know this is a poorly received opinion, but casual players were promised No Limits would stick around when they decided to change QP. I didn't believe it then so I wasn't surprised when it went away, but it isn't right nor is it fair that the game a lot of us bought originally doesn't exist outside of the whims of the developers or Custom Games.

Edit: Despite how I started this comment, there is no hostility towards the OP at all, just disappointment with how the game has evolved.

I wish you guys would remember that competitive is only a small part of the game and that the casual scene suffering affects us all. Your downvotes don't bother me, but the idea that the downvotes are coming from a place of disdain for casual players or casual game modes is discouraging. QP should've stayed how it was and a different mode should've been made for Competitive Practice. Everyone would've won that way, but that isn't what happened. I still hope that it will be that way one day soon and, although misguided as it may be, I hope that the community will be less hostile towards each other as a result.

A lot of the trolls in games come from the displacement that occurred with the changes early on in the game's life. People who played for fun could no longer do so until Custom Games came about and, even then, it was largely just a Band-Aid for what many people originally loved about QP.

Someone said about CTF that one game mode shouldn't be removed for the sake of another and that is true even for the original QP. I'm sorry if others don't see it that way, but it is true nonetheless.",Overwatch
64344,"Roadhog went from 8% to 0% along with Rein and zarya who were at similar pick rates.

Roadhog certainly didn't cause the rise of dive, it was an established thing, but he was the closest thing to a counter that existed.",Overwatch
64350,The flashbang is really really good and has always been that way.,Overwatch
64365,"there's no point on choosing roadhog if he can't one hit anymore. I mean, c'mon... hooking someone is already difficult as it is, he's not that useful as a tank, he have a goddamn shotgun so don't put any hope for his accuracy, and his dps is lower than ever. the nerf basically made hog unplayable. don't blame people if they think you're trolling or throwing the match if you picked him.",Overwatch
64378,"I've been wondering for a while. We know that OW (and games in general - see wow healer queue times or lol support queue times) has an issue in QP where people insta-lock DPS - and few people play Support (and tank).

When Lucio 2.0 was announced and released, a lot of people were saying they would be more willing to play Support now.

People saying ""Time to main Lucio"" or ""He finally looks fun!"" were heavily upvoted.

I'd argue some of the Lucio changes were trying to get more of the DPS crowd to pick him up (higher damage, faster projectile).

It's hard to feel it out, Lucio's Play Rate has always been high in comp (and still is). His play rate in QP has always been pretty good (usually 2nd most played, after Mercy). I wonder if it's just the same people though.

I'd love to see more people interested in healing - but I wonder if it's possible. Just something I've been mulling over recently.",Overwatch
64380,"To me, Roadhog has always punished fun styles of gameplay. So your copypasta idea of him punishing bad players doesn't sit well with me.",Overwatch
64397,Yeah but he has a golden weapon the I totally didn;t buy ,Overwatch

64462,"The only character that may actually not be viable is Roadhog, and even then I'm not sure is as bad as everybody makes him out to be. I very rarely see the same comps in competitive. Who do you think isn't viable?",Overwatch
64482,"I would suggest making a custom game lobby for this. If a lot of people have been asking for this like you said, there should be no problem with that lobby filling up",Overwatch
64527,"Same as they were before, you're more likely to get gold directly though",Overwatch
64532,the patch is live! Completely exit battle net app and open it again :D,Overwatch
64562,"I recently came back to the game and, no matter what some people claim, Elo Hell is very much real. I lost half the games from placements and ended up in gold. The games I lost vs. the games I won were like night and day.
During every victorious game everyone or nearly everyone on the team was communicating in chat, calling out ults, using cover and naturally falling back when my shield started to crack.

In contrast, all the lost games had me as the only one talking in chat, trying to herd a litter of cats with a serious case of tunnel-vision. Nobody talked, nobody communicated. People would start chasing the enemy to their spawn and get promptly killed, costing us the point. They'd run ahead of my shield, even though there was absolutely no need, only to get killed again.
Turrets were ignored and I'd usually end up with 2-3 gold medals... as Reinhardt.

You cannot seriously tell me that this is supposed to be my level of play. MMR exists to put people of a similar together, but for the majority of games it feels like I'm the only one who even gives a single shit about winning the match or acting as a team.

The only response I get is Winston telling me to ""fuck off cunt"", when I tell him and the others to stop ignoring the Symmetra turrets that have killed us from behind the last three times in a row.",Overwatch
64585,"I play zen a lot and I use the charged shot a lot too. It is much easier to deal with flanking tracers/sombras with the charged shot. When I shoot with lmb on a genji and he starts reflecting I stop and charge the alternate shot until his reflect animation is over and then he gets what he deserves.
So I have to reload very often and this would help me a lot. I also want to cancel my charged shot often when my target dies or I need to send out healing orb but until now, I had to waste it in most cases and had to reload needlessly often. I can't wait to try that out.",Overwatch

I really don't get this reasoning. What the heck do you guys even mean by this? Does being within Roadhog's LoS within 20m mean you are ""out of position""? What if Roadhog's on a point/payload? Do you have to stay away from that point/payload just to ""be in position""? No. Roadhog just kills whoever the heck he wants to kill. And that was balanced and fine.

65226,"&gt; Except the Roadhog nerf was widely regarded as a stupid thing to do.

They didn't do it right. 

The difference I think is Hook -&gt; Shoot -&gt; Kill was pretty much 90% of roadhogs playstyle. It was his entire gameplay. So now it's gone with left with this hero who just doesn't feel good to play.

Hanzo on the other hand is not entirely built around scatter arrow. It's a tool in his overall arsenal. I think it's mental that people think it's okay in it's current state. The hero is dire outside of scatter arrow. They need to re balance his abilities power budget.

&gt; Stop trying to compare heroes which are nothing alike.

I'm not comparing the heroes. I'm comparing the similar situation. 

&gt; You have to be behind their shield/matrix 80% of the time, and you have to be able to actually hit their feet accurately. It doesn't need a nerf, it's not like you can aim in the general vicinity of heroes and get kills like pharah/junkrat.

I actually think it's far too easy to use at the moment. You can just fire it into a room if you think someone is in there. If their squishy it'll do like 50% - 100% of their health and a tank will lose like 50% of their hp. It's crazy and is the least skillful part of his kit.",Overwatch

66724,What is CQC and is there a list or spreadsheet of very useful video game jargon such as things like CC,Overwatch
66727,We actually did it on our first try too. Really lucky.,Overwatch
66760,"Why don't you go healer or tank

Stop being do whiny ",Overwatch
66772,"Well, 1. Why are you fighting an enemy winston as a genji with the expectation of winning?

But more importantly, there should be no difference between the two. People who play comp don't exclusively play comp, remember. The same person teabagging after a POTG as reaper in comp is the same person who does it in quickplay, and such you should view both situations as the same.

Someone will likely use the same strats in QP as they do in comp, so you should never let it get to your head, no matter when it happens.",Overwatch
66799,Won't the bastion just fuck up the reaper. And with the conning Zaria buffs... gonna be fun for sure XD. ,Overwatch
66830,What did you like about normal 3v3s? Personally I like lockout a lot better because the old one was always the same couple heroes with little to no variety. Lockout forces you to play other heroes that might not otherwise be useful.,Overwatch
66831,"there is some exception, i last time read some articles and one of the china MMO games they have a skeleton laying down as a dead body.

i think skull is fine as long as not represent demonic nature. which is, reaper is not demon.",Overwatch
66850,"Pretty much, yeah. Group phase is mostly a formality, and the tournament only start at the elimination phase. ",Overwatch
66878,If tracer loses to rein 1v1 when they still have recall they need to uninstall. The only way I can see it happening is if rein is standing on top of a mega health pack in an enclosed space and tracer tries to engage. ,Overwatch
66882,I find support mains that play mostly Ana and Zen to be Sombra mains (me). ,Overwatch
66907,"Now, not to say there isn't a problem with the system, BUT:

1- When action is taken, they can't give us details. The most they could tell us is that action has been taken against someone we reported, but they couldn't provide additional details for multiple reasons.

2- They cannot possibly follow up on every individual report. Multiple reports need to be given about the individual before they'll investigate. If you, and everyone else, stops reporting, action will never be taken.

3- Due to the above, it could take time before any action is taken, depending on how quickly people report.

Any kind of repercussion system is difficult to balance. You do not want to spend your time chasing ghosts (people reported for throwing because they're playing an off meta hero in a game), and you do not want to ban someone for a crime they didn't commit (some accused of aimbotting who just has really good aim).

It's not an easy task to police this efficiently. I understand your frustration, I do, but you have to take the other side into consideration as well.

If the game is getting to your right now, maybe take a break. Things should settle down in the (relatively) short future and you can come back refreshed and with, hopefully, a better environment to play in.",Overwatch
66929,"Yeah, in part of the prime years for a video gamer...",Overwatch

66990,"Yea I realized it was probably a bug, but it still added a ton of fun to playing doomfist, as there are so many places which his shift JUST falls short and the E just allowed him to finish the jump off.

67110,Fuck lore. This shit is hilarious and i would love if it was real.,Overwatch
67131,"This idea is thrown around a lot and one of the general ideas has been that it would be easier to simply have the same HP but passively reduce how much ultimate Roadhog provides compared to other heroes taking the same damage. No need to treat one bar of HP on Roadhog as different to one bar on Rein, from a damage or free melee kill sort of perspective, and keeps things simpler overall from a player's perspective.",Overwatch
67201,You can't sit on those seats you float above them,Overwatch
67211,"Yea, in my recent matches I did manage to keep my accuracy above 50% and managed to destroy gold players in competitive.

67218,"As said by Blizzard, a melee-only hero is very hard to balance in an FPS game, and you're basically making a support have the same range as a tank, which is a huge disadvantage.

I'd personally go with something like magic, for example. We don't have any heroes that use magic, or at least technology in such a way that it resembles magic. Could you imagine a support hero shooting some lightning bolt bursts at the enemy team and the more damage it deals, the better it heals?",Overwatch
67246,Essentially he's genji with a pharah ult. He's got a higher health pool plus a passive that grants his shield. He can close gaps faster than genji.,Overwatch

67452,"I don't know why you're being downvoted, you're just voicing your opinion. I have to agree with you, especially the second part. Her ult is already super game changing. Imagine this coupled with a Sombra EMP, that's pretty much a guaranteed team wipe",Overwatch

67477,"This may be some paranoia talking so foil hat is on  but hog counters doomfist pretty well. He can pull doomfist off players before he gets combos off.

But if you go on a 10 game winning streak, that means you're gonna drop pretty far when things start to even out, which can be crushing for many of us, myself included. I bought a PC right before the start of this season (played on console since release) and placed in high bronze out the gate. That was crushing. But I peaked at 1950 after a great winning streak. Then dropped about 250 SR over the double XP event. Now I'm making my way back up, but seeing less massive streaks. I'm hoping to at least hit gold this season, but praying for platinum. If I can keep a decent win rate going, I should at least end up where I think I belong (mid to high gold). Just don't let the streaks, good or bad, lull you into a false sense of security.

67959,"I personally think it was to do with the consistency in which Roadhog could OHK, in that if you did land the hook on an enemy ""squishy"" they were certainly dead. A change that I would have been happy to see in Roadhog was a slight reduction to the length of his hook, for example reducing it from 20 meters to somewhere between 12-15 meters.

However, when it comes to heroes like, for example Hanzo, you may not hit every scatter arrow and if you did then every scattered arrow may not even hit! And this can be said the same for Roadhog due to a player needing to be accurate with the hook.
(I personally I as a player have not been killed by scatters as much as they have done damage to me so that might be why I don't understand the hate towards the OHKs..)

I think OHKs make the game exciting as it adds to that element of risk when running into a certain hero! But having a low margin of error on a hero when performing a OHK and having other heroes potentially not be as consistent I think that needs to be addressed.

68533,"I mostly agree, but it's not so black and white.  If everyone on the team is a DPS main and they lock onto their best hero, it's not going to work.  You still need to be able to flex a bit and try to make a team comp that can sort of work.  It doesn't have to be meta or 2/2/2, but you do need some tanking and healing.

You should try to start off with a hero you're strong with.  But, sometimes, switching to a hero you might not be best at to counter a difficult enemy player or to fit a certain situation IS the right play.  There's no over arching piece of advice here...every situation is different and this is just game sense and game experience.  Enemy tracer giving you trouble?  Maybe switch from soldier to McCree.  Trying to defend and contest last point?  Maybe a mei switch is useful.  Pushing payload to final point and getting stuck?  Maybe you need a shield tank like Rein or Orisa.  Getting countered hard as pharah by a widow and zen?  Switch to a different DPS.

This is why it's important not to be a one trick pony.  Don't spread yourself thin...but ideally, you can do a few different roles half decent when situation calls for it.",Overwatch
68543,"Killing them as late as possible at the end of a teamfight is not only a strategy but something that is quite important at high levels of Overwatch. It's not just for demoralization, it's just solid gameplay. But you rarely see it outside of staggering a baby DVA.",Overwatch

68824,"He provides vision and has more mobility than those two, though.

He also has the possibility to one shot a squishy meaning you can instantly push when on attack.  Deleting an enemy is an excellent opening move.

68840,"2nd bug:

in my 2nd match of the day, I had yet another leaver.

So my team is just biding time to lose and move on (understandably). I get a message saying i'll be kicked if i remain inactive, so I begin shooting at the enemy team.

after shooting 12-15 consecutive junkrat balls into the point, I am KICKED from the match for inactivity. i have seen the message before but I have never been kicked for inactivity while actively shooting at the enemy team. and no, it wasn't a close timer, meaning i had been shooting at least a dozen rounds before being kicked (i know because I had to reload twice).",Overwatch

68902,"Mystery Heroes is my favorite gamemode. As frustrating as it can be for the team to get wrecked over and over again on attack because you never get any healers (until suddenly 4 people switch to healers at once), it's still just a ton of fun and an excuse to play every hero without guilt. Most games turn into total shit shows but that's kinda the joy of it. 

I do wish teams were limited to 1 of each hero tho. Having 2 mercys that can rez each other when your team finally picks one off makes that team basically unbeatable especially with the ult snowballs that tend to happen with the winning team. Or if the defense team has multiple shield tanks then pushing through a choke with a uncoordinated team is almost impossible. But those gripes aside it's still probably my favorite game mode and I love how it's not toxic.",Overwatch
68916,"This will be way to agressive and offensive again, they changed roadhog because he was just a insta-kill machine for everyone that was in his line of sight (and even the ones that where not with hook 1.0)

Roadhog is a tank, he should be a damage soaker or a punisher for enemy dps that play out of position. With the defensive buffs he is about to get this should become more of a reality. At the moment he is a def hero that is mostly viable on maps with edges (illios well, nepal,...) and besides that he seems more of a ult farm for the enemy team.",Overwatch

69175,"I've never heard of a developer that doesn't punish people for purposely exploiting bugs to gain an unfair advantage. It'd be a discussion if they were banning those that accidentally discover them, but if you're using unintended glitches to gain an advantage you're either:

1. Purposely trying to ruin the game for those that want to play it fairly (read: 99%+ of the community)

2. Need to git gud, because you feel the need to exploit because you can't hack it normally.

Either way, it's foolish to think blizzard, or any game company for that matter, should actively side with those looking to ruin their games and the experiences of their community.    

Edit: hack it as in play on the level of everyone else, not actually attempt to hack the game, in case that wasn't clear.",Overwatch

69480,"I'm not saying Blizzard is working at capacity, in fact I truly believe Blizzard employees are contractually mandated to sit around for two hours a day with their thumb up their asses, I'm just arguing that this isn't that important in the grand scheme of things. I'd rather see matchmaking in competitive is tweaked for greater quality of play, harsher punishments for those who quit mid match, bux fixes for Rein, buffs to Hog, etc. There are plenty of other things that are more important to fix to ensure the longevity of Overwatch as a game. Just my opinion though. ",Overwatch
