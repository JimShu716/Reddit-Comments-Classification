409,"This was by far the best performance of this side that I've seen so far. They were relentless in their pressing and always manages to do something with their possession. 

They also needed a lot of luck with the few truly dangerous chances that spain created and pollersbeck (the discovery of the torunament imo) managed to perfectly stay on his toes despite not even having to save anything for the vast majority of the game because the german defenders blocked a ridiculous amount of shots.

But all that wouldn't have been enough if Spain fully found their way into the game. Instead, they were shifting their momentum a lot (being passive for 25 minutes, pressing for 15 minutes) to confuse our defence when it really just made it harder for them to get into their flow.

And even with all that accounted for; Kimmich's header was anything but a 100% chance and if that one missed and it ended 0-0 at the 90th minute I just cannot imagine how the german team could possibly hold the same amount of intensity for another 30 minutes.

I fully believe in our attack and midfield we are in a better position on paper. However our lack of depth and our continuity of selling and loaning players is killing pretty much any chance we have at a trophy this year, we lack so much depth, maybe it's the reason Conte stuck with pretty much the same side through all pre season to get them extremely fit for the season ahead.

Ultimately, the MLS should have started off as an open league to begin with, but because they didn't, and are starting to make some serious cash, and teams are interested in joining, there's no need to change the format in the owners sense.

3317,"Yes but my point is the longer we wait to buy a striker, especially with other teams in for high quality strikers, the less there will be available and the worse deal we're gonna get. The onus is on us to buy, not the other team to sell so patience and waiting for the right deal isn't helping us near as much as strengthening there position. Player + cash exchanges are exceedingly rare, the simple fact is we're going to have to pony up big cash for high quality players and the board doesn't seem willing, which is especially aggravating when we've sold so many players recently. 

You think if we keep waiting, say Milan buy one of Belotti/Morata and we go for the other, we're gonna get a better deal than now? They'll bleed us dry even worse than they're trying to now, there is little supply and we have high demand and all the teams know that.

Board has been spending cash, but not enough for what the market is now. Not since Torres have we really spent, just looking for bargains and it worked out last year, went from our A choice targets to Luiz on deadline day (who played great but i guarantee wasn't a top 3 CB target for Conte). I understand market is ridiculously inflated but thats something out of our control, all the big teams around are spending and shoring up their team, we easily have the worst striker out of the top 6 without costa and any striker that could put us back near the top would be 70+.

I know Spurs haven't spent anything yet but they've only sold Walker. We've sold Ake and lent out Zouma, countered by Christensen and Rudiger coming in fair enough, but we've also lost Chalobah and RLC, likely to lose Matic as well and only have Bakayoko in. Costa is also gone, and we're down to 14 first team outfielders.

The way the board has gone about transfers this summer is imo terrible. Selling to heavily without any replacements lined up or coming in, I know we're negotiating now and have been throughout but other teams know how desperate we continue to grow as we sell and they're gonna crank up the price and we'll get more excuses from our fans about the price being ridiculous and its good we didn't give in.

so for me, the issue here is less about what Suarez did and more about how the system does not correctly address the situation. It should be (IMO) an automatic goal, plus the red card. then there is no incentive to try things like this.

Consider 2 sets of prices, A = {4,6,8,8,9} and B = {6,8,8,18,60}. Mean(A) = 7 and Mean(B) = 20. Does it stand to reason, then, that ¬£9 in the word of set A = ¬£26 in set B? I'd say no, because the mean of B is skewed by that ¬£60 monster, and ¬£9 wasn't much of an outlier in world A. ¬£26 in B would be well over three times the median price, whereas ¬£9 is just over double the minimum in A.

Completely true and not a myth at all. Passive football against Dortmund became more and more normal for every year under Klopp. I watched every match by them. There's a reason why we lost 1-0 in every match under Klopp. Almost every team gave zero fucks. They got an early goal by our terrible defense, and camped it out the rest of the match.  You could argue it was a result of us being down for the majority of the time as opposed to other seasons, but it doesn't change the fact that parking the bus happened way more.

11841,"I think Belotti and Morata have been playing at the top level for more or less the same amount of time if I'm not mistaken. I don't watch either player's team so I don't have much to refer to other than stats but Morata broke into the Madrid team 13/14 (had 12 appearance in 12/13 and then 23 in 13/14) when belotti went to Palermo, which is obviously not at the same level but he did get the same amount of games (and i'd wager more minutes).

Thats a fair point and I can't really refute it because I don't watch enough Juve to really say either but I'm not particularly convinced by Morata either from what I've seen of him, not sure if he can make the move to a higher level and be the main man (he was definitely second choice to Benzena and as far as I know played most of the games against lesser sides). Tbh I would be happy with either of them being signed by Chelsea and I was under the false impression that Belotti was 2/3 years younger than Morata as opposed to just the 1 so it is much closer than i previously thought. 

Edit- Although there is definitely an argument to be made in Morata's favour, despite not making many appearances before 13/14 season, he did still have some with the Madrid senior team and presumably trained with the one of the best teams in the world with some of the best staff in the world, and similarly at Juve.

Your relationship sounds really nice. I am happy you have a nice relationship. Your gf could literally be God and give you Heaven on Earth and you would still be paying in the time you spent with her. You are trading your time and energy for whatever happens with her. She is also trading her time and energy for whatever happens with you. You keep talking about how you're happy to do so - that's the point!! I'm not saying you should be sad to be paying or that it is negative to pay.

I don't know how to be clearer. Here is another example:

In the relationship you and I have, we write comments to each other on the internet. I am paying with my life (about 10 minutes so far) to write to you. Regardless of what I get in return, that 10 minutes is spent. I could've spent it doing absolutely anything else in the world but I spent it here.

He really has transformed this season last in my eyes now that he scores consistently and really works hard. He can be a bit inconsistent but it's never because he doesnt try, which is really the most important thing out of a star player. He is just sometimes marked out of games or has things not go his way. I think he is really helped by having other dangerous players in the team again, but he has really improved in his own right and what more can you ask of a prospect that was already as talented as he was when we got him.

Definitely better than Alves. He is riding a reputation hard right now. Juve fans are glad he is gone after a very lackluster season. Don't let two top performances in the CL deceive you.

And Walker has been comfortably the best RB in the league these past couple seasons ahead of some of the world's other better RBs like Valencia and Coleman. Outside of Carvajal though, where's his competition? Top teams right now are lacking top RBs. Barca, Bayern and Juventus are pretty much without natural starting quality right backs. There are plenty of good RBs out there and some promising up-and-coming players but all of them are a step below Walker and Carvajal right now. It's part of the reason Bayern, Juve and Barca are pretty much still without RBs, players like Sidibe, Gaspar, Hysaj etc are simply not top quality. Walker is definitely a standout in his position and that's why City are willing to pay so much to bring him in where he'll play in front of Alves.

Ronaldo dragged Porto to the Euro final and practically coached them after he went down injured. On paper that team is barely top 7-8 in Europe (Spain, Germany, France are way better, Italy, England, Croatia, Holland arguably better)

Messi was amazing in La Liga but not in the CL this year. It was Neymar, not him, who dragged them all the way back against PSG and he didn't do much against juve either. And as a Chelsea fan I'll always remember the missed PK that would've knocked us out of the semis.

It was more expensive than Ronaldo's transfer from Inter to Real, Ronaldinho's from PSG to Barca, Rooney to United, any of the transfers to Chelsea during Roman's first few years, etc etc, and I believe it was the record transfer fee for a defender for nearly a decade.

If you want to end gender segregation in sports, that means allowing the women to compete with the men and allowing the men to compete with the women. Barcelona are an absolutely amazingly skilled team. They are also professional athletes in tip top shape. Messi is disturbingly fast and strong. Just because someone is short doesn't mean they aren't strong or fast. Men also have larger lungs in proportion to their bodies. So they can run faster and for longer periods of time. If you allowed the Barcelona B team to try out for the women's world cup team, they would replace all of the women players and there would be no women left. How can you allow women to compete in men's leagues and not allow men to compete in women's leagues if you're being equal? Like you said, on average men would be stronger, faster, have higher endurance, etc. And the strongest, best women would still only have the physical potential of the average men; the best, strongest men would be beyond them. Would you rather have women's leagues and men's leagues (gender segregation), or a large men's league with a tiny number of women's players who are born as genetic exceptions with extraordinary physical might and talent and might sometimes get to play (gender equality)?

Also, even skill in sports is physical. For instance, in football skill is how well a player has trained their small muscle groups. Dribbling requires use of leg muscles, kicking the ball requires muscles, using light touches requires muscles, doing moves requires muscles, etc. Men have denser muscle fiber, so their muscle groups that control these functions can act quicker, stronger, and for longer periods of time. In other words, they can do faster and stronger moves, touches, passes, etc. for longer periods of time with more consistency, which is really important in a 90 minute game without timeouts. I still don't understand why you think Messi is not strong or fast; he is a beast. He is crazy fast, and have you seen how hard his shots are? His legs are super strong.",soccer

Cristiano Ronaldo also IS aging, he's adapting his play, he's visibly in great shape, he's doing it really great and he's great, he shines in many big moments etc., but if you look at output throughout whole season, I don't think Real fans would argue it's showing he's past 30 - compared to his play earlier.

Gibbs and Wilshere being overrated doesn't say anything about or team because it's all mutually exclusive. If your argument is that a youth player should be rated by ge amount of senior appearances he makes for he team that found him, then I implore you to consider how much it means to win titles. Nathan Ake and Bertrand Traore were just sold for 30m, after being signed at a relatively young age, when they were just about unknown, you call that profiteering, I call that successfully developing two youth prospects into senior players. 

Also, I like how you consider Terry, Huth, and Carlton Cole ""players from 20 years ago"" when each of them made their senior debuts under Reiner around 2002, the same time fabregas made his Arsenal debut, and only five years before Gibbs and Wilshere made theirs.

36478,"That's a fair thing to say, I guess I meant that in part, I think Sanchez wouldn't sign anyway so offering it just somewhat sets a terrible precedent for other players. We offer Sanchez 300k a week, but he leaves, so Ozil is like.... well I'm leaving unless I get 300k a week. Then Walcott says he's leaving unless he gets 180k, because they offered 300k to Sanchez and on and on.

Ultimately he's 28, actually he'll be 29 in December, so if he stays with us he'll be almost 30 the next time he has a chance to play in the CL. If he signs for 4 years, he's basically saying he won't win a CL or league title till he's 32 and then he would hope a top team wants him at that age. The other option is leave at worst a year from now to a top team, for him the choice is pretty obvious so I think making huge offers only hurts Arsenal on the whole.

I'd like Sanchez to stay, but if he wants bigger money or more success he's got to stay elsewhere, if he loves Arsenal and thinks Wenger can win, he'd stay for a reasonable wage increase but we shouldn't break the bank to save one player.

36948,"Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is preparing to wait out his contract and leave Arsenal on a free transfer next summer, after rejecting a take-it-or-leave-it offer from the club.

The young England attacker was offered a significant wage increase to extend his deal at the Emirates but declined - because his priority is playing time, rather than improving his terms.

Liverpool were rebuffed when they made a direct approach to Arsenal to discuss Oxlade-Chamberlain‚Äôs availability, earlier this week, leaving all parties at an impasse. Oxlade-Chamberlain is attracted by the idea of playing for Jurgen Klopp, given Klopp‚Äôs record with developing the attacking gifts of players such as Adam Lallana, Gini Wijnaldum and Sadio Mane.

At 23, he is most eager to nail down a regular role in a top team and start games consistently ‚Äì something that has not quite happened at Arsenal, despite six seasons there. Though Arsene Wenger has said Oxlade-Chamberlain figures prominently in his plans, experience has made the player cautious regarding promises about a starting role.

Oxlade-Chamberlain is determined to be in England‚Äôs squad for next summer‚Äôs World Cup, but is prepared to run down his contract ‚Äì which expires in 2018 ‚Äì even if that means being jettisoned from Arsenal‚Äôs team.


Arsenal are believed to value Oxlade-Chamberlain at ¬£25m, despite the limited time left on his deal. Since joining from Southampton, for an initial ¬£12m in 2011, Oxlade-Chamberlain has scored 20 times in 194 games for the Gunners, winning 27 England caps.

The impasse over a valued talent is yet another thing to deal with at a busy time for Arsenal, who are close to agreement with Lyon over Alexandre Lacazette after indicating they are willing to break their club record of ¬£42.4m to sign the prolific French striker.

They are embroiled in sagas with Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez over contract extensions. Both star players have so far declined hefty wage offers to stay with Sanchez valuing himself so highly that Bayern Munich were quoted wage demands of ‚Ç¨25m per season (¬£420,000 per week) when they explored his situation.

Bayern‚Äôs interest in the Chilean has now receded, leaving Manchester City likeliest to sign Sanchez should he leave the Emirates. Like Ozil and Oxlade-Chamberlain he has one year remaining on his current deal.

37333,"Ok now I get. His three years under Laurent Blanc  destroyed his image.

When he plays 9, Cavani actually misses less than Lewandoski, Auba, Suarez, Aguero and even Messi. 

But yeah it's hard to forget his  fails under Laurent Blanc. That bastard made him play on the wing. 
How Benzema , Suarez or Lewa would perform on the wing ?
Cavani is not skilled, just a finisher, anyway , even on the wing he never score less than 30 goals a season.

37407,"I'd say signing Van Nistelrooy, Higuain, Robben, and Sneijder were also great decisions of his, but then Perez came in and decided to banish most of the vestiges of Calderon's tenure because then Perez wouldn't be the one receiving the credit. You're right, Marcelo was definitely the best though. Post-2014 Perez has turned a new leaf (loving his approach to signing young players especially), but still kinda bitter about selling those players. Imagine Cristiano and Robben on each wing...

38047,'One of the best teams ever' in an era where another team was clearly a lot more dominant doesn't really add up. In the era you named even Valencia (and Bayern) reached more finals. It's an absolute bollocks statement that's probably fuelled by sentiment or something.,soccer

Conversely, arsenal have a fairly poor record of bringing through players, despite so much longevity with the manager.",soccer
38160,"Before this window we didn't have a massive squad to begin with, if you look at it you can see it's still padded with a lot of youth players, Valencia has gone back which is who Sandro looks to be replacing, though I can see Stekelenburg moving on, McCarthy being shifted as he only plays for Ireland at the moment, and we have a packed out midfield now. I do believe Roms on his way out but it needs to be done quick, otherwise it'll turn into another Stones situation where the club refuse to let him leave because it'd take too long to bring another player in and get him up to speed with the first team.

Also Mcgeady and Garbutt could be on their way out, Kone and Deulofeu are gone now too though shocker Niasse is being included in the squad.",soccer

They set prices for many positions each offseason. They also won the EL and are in the CL this season. It was dumb to expect them to reach the glory they had with a 20+ year all-time great manager. They also suffered a major setback when they hired Moyes, who since then, has been outed as a terrible manager.

38296,"The years of service ended several years ago, he has been holding the club back since then and we've been paying him an extortionate amount of money for the privilege. There is simply no way he is going to improve Everton. I'd suggest watching every minute he's played over the past few years and see how excited you remain about the move afterwards.",soccer
38297,"The same old tired routine. As I told you before, there's a difference between not wanting titles stripped and knowing that they won't be. The SFA have already made it clear that they would be unlikely to win a case and the sanctions they could impose on Rangers would be limited were they to win, which obviously means they would not be able to strip them of titles.",soccer

39283,"the biggest joke is that you fooled the world (and sanchez) into thinking a 29 year old winger was what you needed and now you've got a 25 year old with more wins and better stats (though it's arguably easier for real madrid than arsenal) whose prime is still above him, for less fees and wages",soccer

39422,"Well it's not just making it or not. Winning other trophies could also make it worth it and there is a clear benefit in not widening the gap between ourselves and our direct opposition (Bayern aren't paying 60million for S√°nchez and the reports suggest PSG is a no-go). The intangible benefits go as far as making 'a statement' that we are no longer a selling club, avoiding fan and media unrest from selling our top scorer after falling out of the top 4 that could severely hamper our season, etc.

&gt; If you look at the club's spending, the net spend was ¬£32m in 2013/14, ¬£78m in 2014/15, ¬£22M IN 2015/16, ¬£87M IN 2016/17. The average net spend is just over ¬£50m/season, and high spending seasons are typically followed by low-spending seasons. 

This season has already killed that trend, but anyway, I'm failing to see what your point is here? Our average net spend being ~¬£50m (as I said before we could actually spend slightly more if we wanted) doesn't suggest we are just scraping by?

Anyway, I don't disagree that there's an argument for selling, I just think there's an equally valid one for keeping him - a last point being that a lot of things can happen in a year and there's a chance he could be convinced to stay.",soccer

Draxler made a good step forward he had a long low phase after his very good start at Schalke. I also think Ter Stegen did very good in the tournament so I don't think Neuer would have had that much impact. Still a very huge difference between Ter Stegen and Neuer.

With Boateng-Hummels-Kroos I agree. As I said I see them kinda as the heart. Also Werner was very good. However I wonder why you don't list Stindl? Mueller is Mueller but he is hard to fit in a system. The thing is with Reus/Draxler on the wings I can see M√ºller playing a position that fits him well. About the rest I'm not sure. Oezil is a great player for example but sometimes he just goes invisible.

Alot of people say Germany won with a total 'B' 11 but I still think most of them are very good players and was just overlooked for a long time and could be contender for the starting spots.

Yes, qualifiers may mean less but France and Spain struggled with consistency. How do you explain what happened Spain 2014?

41257,"If Ronaldo can win the BDO without being the best player on his team so can Neymar while still being at Barca.  
And he reaches Messi levels many times a season, he just can't sustain it for long enough. 

Maybe he should be finishing those clear cut chances he has in front of goal instead of blasting them over the post. And this is not an outlier event. If Neymar had the consistency of shots on goal close to that of Messi, he would be having 60-70+ goals a season. Which is because he gets more opportunities to have those moments precisely because there are players like Messi alongside him who are setting him up. 

Its not just a 1 way streak.  

Also he should be passing more to Alba who overlaps 20 times a match and gets passed like once and that too maybe next match. This thing alone makes the situation easier to digest for many a Barca fan (after the price of course).  Its so frustrating to watch. This is not development. Neymar needs to understand this. 

Neymar can develop and reach his ceiling even at Barca. This narrative that because Messi is there he can't become better is the most ridiculous BS i have read on this matter.  

How is Messi's presence impeding Neymar's ability to fucking put the ball in the net when he is freaking getting setup by Messi and through on goal basically 1v1.  
This is on Neymar and Neymar alone and that doesn't change if he is a PSG or United.  
Elite Club football is structured in a way where there is multiple high profile players, even PSG have them, if Sanchez goes you don't think he will take tactical and other sporting space from Neymar. Cavani is already there as well. Its not like Neymar is going to some lowly team where he is the only and only exclusive megastar and will have the ball super majority of time and do everything.

&gt; The painting also represents a new style of painting portraits. Its style of sfumato or loosely translated to vanish set the tone for years after. That stype as well as the use of transparent glazes helped instill this painting as one that would be copied for years to come. This one painting influences many that came after it. This singular painting set the tone for portrait paining in the 16th century.
The fascination with this painting isn't just a modern day occurrence. Napoleon had it in bed room. Also, we only have about 20 painting by Da Vinci. Compared to say 600 by Rembrandt and the 50 thousand of works of Picasso. Saying that this painting is famous just because it is stolen is similar to saying that Nirvana was a good band just because of Cobain's suicide. There are lot more factors other than the fact it was stolen.

http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny
You look at Mona Lisa and you think:""there is nothing new here."" But that is because da Vinci's techniques influenced almost every other painter who cam after him.
In Monda Lisa da Vinci achieved the effect of the subject seeming alive, and included the effect of an aerial perspective for the background. The techniques seem common, almost cliche nowadays.
""The Storm"" was painted 400 years after Mona Lisa, yet Mona Lisa still stands up to it attesting to its timeless value.

You rate atleti over Juve despite the fact that the latter has the same record and reached the final just this season, and you rate PSG even lower despite the fact that they are, in fact, a particularly dangerous team.

47437,"&gt; MLS/American model only leads to mediocrity/complete shit

Bullshit. 

The salary cap and team stability encourage owners to invest and develop. 

Aside from the super clubs, European leagues are filled with mediocrities that have no chance of excelling. The stay in the same few spots in the league table season after season. They can't afford to buy good players. They are often forced to sell their best players. And they buy the players they need at inflated prices and keep them long enough so they aren't relegated. 

Coaches are not given a chance to develop players or team chemistry. The stakes are so high that even good coaches with a run of bad luck are fired by panicked owners. 

Fresh ideas are too risky and might get the team relegated, so forget about innovation. 

Stability leads to quality. Only a few super clubs in Europe have the stability to develop (and buy) that quality. And they have to pay through the nose for it. 

So as a result we get lopsided leagues where most of the outcomes are pretty much a given.

&gt; - At lunchtime yesterday, Real Madrid made its first offer to buy David. A deal was agreed between the clubs, which included Navas being transferred to Old Trafford. The deals were dependent on each other.

&gt; - In the last several hours of the process, with Navas at the Real Madrid training ground, Real Madrid were controlling the documentation processes of David, Navas and Real Madrid. Manchester United was in control only of the documentation of Manchester United.

&gt; - Manchester United sent transfer documents for both players to Real Madrid at 20:42 BST. David‚Äôs documentation was returned by Real Madrid to Manchester United without the signatory page at 22:32 BST.

&gt; - At 22:40 BST, minutes before the deadline, major changes to the documentation came through to Manchester United which immediately put the deals at risk. 

&gt; - Only at 22:55 BST were the documents that are needed to cancel David‚Äôs contract received by Manchester United from Real Madrid.

&gt; - At this point Navas‚Äô documentation was still not returned by Real Madrid.

&gt; - At 22:58 BST, the transfer agreement was sent back by Manchester United, uploaded onto TMS and accepted ‚Äì all before the deadline.

&gt; - It is our understanding that the deals couldn‚Äôt happen because:

&gt; Real Madrid didn‚Äôt upload David‚Äôs documents onto TMS in time (Manchester United did)

&gt; Real Madrid didn‚Äôt upload David‚Äôs documents to the Spanish league in time, per reports it seems some 28 minutes after the deadline

&gt; - The fact that Manchester United filed the papers on time was acknowledged by the Football Association, who offered to support that claim in any discussions with FIFA. The club offered this assistance, as well as its own timestamped documents to Real Madrid but they have chosen not to go down this route.

We sold Van Dijk for a Scottish record of ¬£12 million 2 seasons ago... he's worth ¬£70 million now.

Are you joking? Celtic are one of the most supported teams in the world, being strongly linked with the Irish diaspora worldwide. Outside the top 4 teams in England, no team has as many supporters as us, and arguably the top 4 only have that many fans because they win things which has drawn in large numbers of 'supporters' from the Far East etc.

Granted, the league as a whole is not that big but you're trying to compare a league in a country of about 5 million people to one of about 50 million, at least make a fair comparison. Half of the teams in the SPL are from towns of less than 80,000 people for christ sake, whilst not a single team in the EPL is. The Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Irish and Croatian leagues are far fairer comparisons, and the SPL matches up to them very well. 

That explains why we are currently at the standard we are - there is a much smaller market and so much less money, and so we cannot afford to or indeed attract big names. In the past decade we have performed far, far better than our financial situation should have allowed us to. If Celtic and Rangers moved to England with the fanbases we have, the massive increase in revenue we would receive as a result would propel us into being top teams.

In summary, KakarotsKid, I think I could probably speak for most Scottish football fans and say that we are quite glad that you don't have an interest in Scottish football, because quite frankly your views on it are incredibly simple-minded. And anyway, we don't watch the SPL because we're looking for a high quality of football - we're not the EPL, or La Liga, or Serie A, and we never will be and we're well aware of that - we watch the SPL because we support our teams no matter what.",soccer

65928,"I looked into it a little more with Ronaldo's case. People said he paid back for his transfer in shirt sales in less than 2 years.

Well, estimates say that annual Madrid shirts are about 1 500 000 (its a little more now, but let's assume it's the average number since Ronaldo's transfer).
Let's assume a price of 80 euros / shirt. 
Let's also assume that Ronaldo's shirt makes up for half (low estimate) to 70% (high estimate) of Madrid shirt sales.

That means, every year, Ronaldo generates a revenue from 64 to 89 Million Euros. 

But that is only the revenue. Madrid only gets about 15%, maybe 20% tops of the actual sales price. Let's assume 20%. That means Madrid makes between 13 and 19 Million euros from Ronaldo shirt sales.

That means at best, Ronaldo ""paid back"" for his transfer fee in 5 years .... and his shirt sales don't even cover his wages anymore.

However, marketing benefits go far beyond shirt sales. There's the rest of the merch, which adds up. 

There's also the much less measurable but very real general impact on image. When you field one of the all-time greatests, you attract better players. You inspire more fear to your opponents. Rich countries / corporations / emir will pay you an insane amount of money just for a friendly game, or meeting the players, or any small event with the players. And most of all, there's an insane amount of money made from publicity deals.

I agree.  Many of the types of typical  injuries that happen over the course of a match (ankle sprains, studs on the ankle, knee) can leave you completely unable to walk off the field at first, but after only a few minutes you can be on your feet and ready to get back on the pitch.  

Forcing players to sit out for a long time like 10 minutes only serves to encourage players to try to injure their opponent to keep them off the pitch.  If everyone time you took someone's feet out they had to sit out for 10  minutes many guys would make it their primary strategy to get teams down to 10 or 9 men and take advantage of that, and just accept the yellow cards they'll probably pick up along the way.

You've bought one player, and potentially might lose Ozil and Sanchez. It's a long summer, who knows what will happen, but buying a striker isn't going too magically solve all of Arsenals issues. There are so many mental, balancing and defensive issues at Arsenal that I don't think throwing money at a few players this summer is going to fix the problem.

I'll leave it around for those interested in a slightly different take:
-----------------------------------------------------

A drunk was interviewed by a news team.  He went on for minutes explaining the concept of ""fua"".  He used to be a seminarist (self-improvement), so it all makes sense.  If you are not a spanish speaker, I have included a transcript and translation (bottom of this post).

http://youtu.be/zROd2y0_F24#t=161

Someone made a nice flash game on fua:

http://www.kongregate.com/games/HectorFV/el-fuaaa

During today's Under-17 soccer final in Mexico City, thousands of fans could be heard saying ""fua!"" as the Mexican goal-keeper would punt the ball (for rivals, it's become tradition to scream ""puto!!!!!!!!!!"").  On the clip below, you can hear the build-up as the goalkeeper sets up the ball, and then....

http://youtu.be/HeT-ztuQ33U

And here is a transcript of the first YouTube clip I shared above...  I removed some irrelevant content from the beginning, and left the last paragraph because it explains the ending to the flash game derived from this meme.

Spanish:

Ya no puedo, pero voy a sacar el fua.  Y lo voy a sacar.  Por que? Porque tengo que dar el extra.  Fua!  Caracter!  Voy y saco!  El fua significa cuando sacas el caracter del estomago y dices, ""Lo voy a hacer.""

""Es que ya no puedo, ya no puedo, ya no puedo.  Como no?!""  Fua!  Fua!  Y saco el caracter, y saco la fuerza, y saco el poder.  Eso es el fua!  No importa lo que hagas.  No importa lo que realizes.  Lo mas importante es el dar el extra.  El fua!  Fua!  Significa dar el extra.

English:

""I can no longer go on, but I'm going to bring out the fua.  Why?  Because I must make an extra effort.""  Fua!  Character!  That's what I bring out!  The ""fua"" is when you take character from your stomach and tell yourself, ""I will do it!""

""But I can't go on...  I can't go on...""  why not?!  Fua!  Fua!  And I bring out the character...  the strength...  the power.  That is the fua.  It doesn't matter what you do.
