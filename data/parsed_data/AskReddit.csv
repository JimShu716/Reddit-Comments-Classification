21,"Was at a trampoline centre for my sisters birthday. We sat down to have a coffee after the session. I comment that the coffee was really hot and it could burn someone. 

The table next to mine was slightly sloped. A woman puts her baby in a high chair next to the table and the waiter puts the coffee down. Since the table was sloped I saw the coffee tip and run off the table. Woman leaps up to clean up the table. But the super hot coffee runs into the lap of the baby in the high chair. 

It starts screaming at it's scalding. The mum freaks out, not knowing what happened. I stand up and grab her baby and shout ""Hot coffee on its lap"" and rip the soaked romper off. I hand the baby back to the mum, jog to the fridge and grab 3 bottles of cold water to pour over the babies lap. 

While the mum is holding the baby I pour each bottle after another. I tell the stunned staff to call 000 and report a burn with hot water. I tell another staff to bring me a cold wet towel. 

I could see the babies skin was red but it wasn't a bad burn. I loosely wrap the baby in the cold wet cloth (while the baby is still in the arms of its mum), by now the baby was making happy baby noises. I collect my things and walk out with my sister and friends. 

As I walked out the ambulance was pulling up.

You meet the girl of your dreams. She's into EVERYTHING you do. You talk about playing video games, and SHE LOVES THEM. You like to rock climb? MY GOD ME TOO!! She loves guitar, and always wanted to learn! She was going to buy a motorcycle this summer already! She's just been waiting until now to get that first tattoo, because she loves them, and has always been really into that! 

Then, after nine months of doing NOTHING but FUCKING, you find out that you two have nothing in common. 

Comics, Blues Rock, Motorcycles, Skateboards, Arcade Games, Playing Guitar, Playing Drums, Singing, recording, writing video games, Painting,Kayaking, Rock Climbing, ect ... 

All things my recent Ex claimed to 'love', and after 9 months of dating, I realized that not only did she not want to be involved in ANY of these activities, but I suddenly didn't have the time for them either. 

The worst part is I'm pretty sure they don't realize they're lying. In the most recent case, it was like anything she would 'claim' to be into, was something she was always into, and had examples of when she started being interested in that from years ago. The problem was that, yeah, maybe she played some pac-man a decade ago, or imagines that playing music might be fun, but if it's something she doesn't do, actively, on her own, when you're not around ... then it's not something you have in common. It's something she only cares about because she wants to be with you. ",AskReddit

211,"I live in San Francisco, and a good amount of the entire downtown area and SOMA smell like human excretement at all times. Even worse than that is walking to work, and you walk by someone who hasn't showered in weeks that is carrying a blanket that probably hasn't been washed in months that is draped over their shoulder.

447,"Because any healthy couple is made up of two individuals, who have their own personalities and voices and needs. The couple as a unit matters, but people in relationships should be *people* first. If they aren't, then they're unlikely to treat a potential partner as a human instead of just a toy. On OKC, your profile is supposed to be about you personally--the rankings and questions and stuff matter, and there's no way to accurately be that personalized as a couple.

And like, if you're really going to insist on diving straight into ""You must date us both as a couple"", that's just not healthy. It's unfair to the third. The couple gets to know each other as individual human beings, but the third isn't supposed to look at them as individuals, just as a unit. That's the difference between a triad developing naturally, and just slotting a third in because you want one.

But yeah, in my experience at least, good poly people are looking for people, super open about their partners and to their partners, and maybe hoping a triad will develop but also willing to date independently. Couples actively looking just for a third who has to treat them only as a couple are almost always unicorn hunting. Not always. But almost always.

1) The women that you befriend will see you as someone who is interested in them as people. Even if those women don't want to date you, they probably have female friends.
2) Talking to women makes it easier to talk to women. Seeing women as people makes it more likely that women will feel respected by you. This will make it easier for you to approach strange women that you find attractive, and more likely that those women will respond well to you.
3) Getting to know women on a platonic level will help you understand some aspects of the female perspective, which will help you understand what women find attractive and why. It will also mean that you have female wingmen, and women are the best wingmen.

Plus concern for new government regulations on fuel costs, that all impacts the price of gasoline. His budget proposal last month cut 46.2 billion on subsidies to the fuel industry in the next decade to stimulate investment in alternative energy sources. There are other factors that have caused the gas price to rise as well, but the administration's actions have deliberately contributed to this rise. He specifically said in 2008 before he was elected, that high gas prices aren't a problem, that Americans are mad only because they rose so high so quickly. He would prefer a gradual price increase. The administration has refused to permit increased energy production domestically.

[KissMeHelga](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ini8t/hey_reddit_who_feels_that_reading_lots_of_books/c255jcs) says it succinctly. It merely brings more from the set of unknowns into the set of knowns. What you do with it is then up to you. If you use it honestly to question all your beliefs/conditioning to try and arrive at some ""objective truth"" it is quite empowering whereas if you pick and choose selectively to only bolster your prior unwarranted beliefs it is quite harmful. Thus ""Intelligence"" has to be applied to what is being ""Read"" so that it itself can grow. The key is to actively seek a variety of thoughts and ideas and apply intelligence to get at the heart of things. One should not lose oneself in the mass of data but must always focus on the essence of the thing under consideration. Read until you are able to grasp the essence and then you may choose to go into the details of various aspects. If done properly, there is a growth of Intelligence else it merely leads to Confusion, ""Analysis Paralysis"" and a loss of Confidence in oneself.

7836,"Driving safely requires processing a shitton of information. The more you do it, the better your brain gets at automating parts of that processing, like tracking your speed or the locations of cars around you, but when you first start driving you have to do that all manually, you probably literally cannot track everything you should be, even if you feel like you can, and even with lots of experience it won't be effortless and you will still be taxing your resources pretty heavily when you drive. In light of that fact, you should be always seek to minimize distractions, this is incredibly important for your first few thousand hours behind the wheel, but really you should try to reduce distractions while driving until the day you die. So...

1. Don't talk on the phone, even with a hands-free device, unless it is truly an emergency - the person on the other end doesn't know what is going on around you so they don't know when to shut the fuck up and let you think, and if they are talking they are tying up resource you might need to avoid death or injury.

2. Don't take your eyes off the road for any longer than you absolutely have to. That means that when you check your blind spot, you do it fast, it means you don't fiddle with the radio unless you are at a dead stop and even then do it as fast as possible and get your eyes back on the road and your mirrors.

3. If you are impaired in *any way*, avoid driving if at all possible. Obviously this means don't drive drunk, but it also means don't drive angry if you can avoid it, don't drive tired (seriously, don't drive tired. You drive about as well after being awake for 24 hours as you do after chugging a beer. Make it 30 hours and you are up to multiple beers) don't drive if you are in significant pain if you can avoid it, etc. Call a cab if you have to, try to adjust your schedule to make sure it doesn't happen often, etc.

4. If you are a new driver, any time you *aren't* driving you should be practicing the more passive parts of driving. Keep track of where cars around you are (you'll be surprised, your brain can keep track of things that pass in and out of view very well with practice. You should eventually be able to identify the location of every car within 20 feet of you in any direction without checking mirrors, just based on where they were when you last saw them in a mirror and how fast they appeared to be going. You should never *assume* that you are correct, but you should always be tracking.)",AskReddit

If you couple that with the fact that straight people become jealous/sad/worried their partner is going to cheat on them because so much of straight culture is wrapped up on wife-ownership and a long history of women as property, it makes a lot more sense that things in cis-male culture are very 'be wary, be on the look out, all men are threats to your relationship and could steal your women' - and then the same thing seemed to happen to cis-women in the 80's, the whole stereotype of a Homewrecker became so much more common/popularized etc that now women have this narrative of '10 things to do in bed that will please your man! How to keep your man' in magazines in every grocery store aisle- like, it's very prevalent these days on both sides that heterosexual people need to be 'on guard' for people trying to steal their partner.

I take the time now to clean off a pair of shoes in the bathroom if something gets on them. I got rid of a ton of my beloved but well worn or second hand clothes that I got only because they were cheap and went on a hunt to replace them with fewer well made, pricier, distinct looking pieces. I've heard people referring to others by the brands they've seen them wear. I've noticed the difference in attention that alumni pay me at networking events at my university. 

I'm lucky in that I've been solidly middle class my whole life. I was raised by a man who's had a job at the same company for going on 40 years, who had the fear of god about poverty put into him early by parents who survived the great depression, meaning he saved every way he could and taught me the importance of frugality while always being there with a handout when frugality just wasn't enough to cover my rent or car or gas for that month. I've worked since I was a teenager and always avoided asking for help, but he's been there and he gave me a hand in buying a house when no one my age has one. It's not because I work harder than other people, I've just been lucky and that frugality has been a big help in getting me into a financial security at an early age that is not accessible to most people.

But what I didn't learn from him was the power of status symbols, because I went without in so many ways. I've had people who were initially interested stop talking to me when they see my iPhone 4S that I'm convinced still only works on my sheer disdain for apple products. I agree when you say fuck these people: I'm trying to find ways to support ethical companies but I prefer buying the throw aways that are other people's trash. I don't like buying new and contributing to consumerism. But at the same time, what I've also realized is that the ability to actually have these economic principles and make decisions based on them is itself a sort of privilege. Poor people don't get to have economic or social principles because they are given circumstances and regardless of what they'd like to do or how they'd like the world to be, their priority is survival and growth where they can get it. I'm likely never going to be poor: that's because of the luck of having no terrible diseases and some generational wealth that has created a comfy safety net for me. I could go about being an ethical consumer of only second hand goods and not worry about what people think when I wear clothing that is on it's last leg.  

But I have realized that if I want these aspects of society to change, it will have to be from within that social setting: You have to show people you can be a part of their social image successfully before they will give your opinions enough credence where it might influence them. So I may be doing what I consider an ethical thing by only buying unwanted and used crap from craigslist, but I will be much less likely to change this system that screws people over and reinforces poverty, desperation, and wealth inequality and disparity by shunning status symbols and the people who use them.  I will consider myself successful if I can do *something* with all my luck and privilege to break down some of these systems because the truth is, the people who must actually change these things often won't even give poor people respect, much less a chance to plead a case for themselves. If I can do one thing to convince someone of power or influence to actually listen to poor people instead of lecturing them about what they, as never-been-poor people think they should do, then it will be worth it.",AskReddit

A) He has said more recently that while he personally disagrees with same sex marriage, the supreme court ruling makes it a done deal and there is no reason for it to be a political issue anymore.

--Respects the rule of law

B) ""Health care policy is only partisan in the abstract. When you or your loved one is sick and needs care, ideology is irrelevant; getting well is all that matters. That same common sense must be reflected in the way we fix Obamacare. Another one-sided plan, driven hard by one party against the wishes of another, can never succeed because it will essentially maintain the status quo: partisan opposition and no real solutions.""

We went to the funeral home hoping to honor her wish for privacy and simplicity while still fulfilling our need to mourn with friends and loved ones. We opted for cremation with no urn (we're going to scatter her ashes) and a simple memorial service without any bells and whistles, no catering, no speeches, no A/V, a single flower arrangement, the standard guestbook, etc. The funeral people were a bit perplexed by how secular and barebones (er, heh) it was, but they never tried to upsell us. 

On the day of the service, another family had a large and elaborate funeral for their young son. They had probably more than 150 guests, lots of flower arrangements, lots of food. The difference between my mom's funeral and the young man's was very pronounced despite our having been exposed to the same ""salespeople."" I doubt that the morticians pushed them into spending money they didn't want to spend. Some people are comforted by a more ornate funeral. Maybe we were lucky, but we also had positive interactions with other funeral homes when we buried my grandparents. Perhaps some families on the margins opt for the more expensive options due to high-pressure sales tactics, but largely I'd imagine the expensive options exist because many people *seek* them.

I like the plane analogy that comes from Stewart Emerys book Actualisation although I came across it in Susan Jeffers' book. 

When landing a plane there is a console known as the inertial guidance system. The purpose of the system is to get the plane within one thousand yards of the runway for landing the plane. Each time the plane strays off course, the system corrects it. The pilot explained that they would land successfully despite ""having been in error 90 percent of the time."" Emery take it from there, stating: ""So the path from here to where we want to be starts with an error, which is correct, which becomes the next error, which we correct, which becomes the next error and so on"" So the only time we are truly on course is that moment in the zigzag where we cross the true path.""",AskReddit

12084,"This was like 6-7 years ago, I was working in a 1$ store. We'd be assigned position for cashier and the 1st cashier would call us for back up in order when needed (so 2nd cashier was going to be there pretty much all day, and 4th cashier and below were going to spend most of their day restocking the alleys). 

I absolutely hated being cashier because my feet hurt a lot when I stand in one place for a long time, people were dicks, and time went by super slowly because the register literally put the time in my face. I much preferred restocking.

The manager was a bitch (she wasn't there when I started working at that place; the previous one was very chill). Like, a legitimate bitch. In the 6 months that I worked there with her as the boss, at least 7 employees quit. I'm talking about employees who, for the most part, had been working there 10+ years. 

When she learned that I preferred restocking to being a cashier, she'd always put me 3rd or 2nd cashier just to piss me off. One time she even put me there from 9 AM to 9 PM because she'd ask for people (who were willing to) to work double shift because the alleys were a mess. I'd volunteered thinking this meant little to no register that day... fucking bitch set me as 2nd cashier.

One day a key holder (supervisor but below the manager) asked me to take the cart where we put all the ""oh, don't want that anymore"" that people give us when they pay and put the stuff back where it belonged. I had been asked by the manager to finish a certain alley, so I told that to the supervisor and she said ""well, she (the manager) said to do this and you're the only one who isn't on a register"". So I did. 

The day after the manager yelled at me in her office because I had not finished restocking my alley. I said I had been told to replace the discarded items, and she said ""NOT BY ME!"". I went to the keyholder (who liked me very much), she went ballistic on the manager lol.

One day I got called to the register. I was at the very back of the store, bringing back empty boxes. I thought I'd just drop the boxes then go to my register. Unfortunately for me she was at the front, and while I was making my way there she called me on the mic to my register. When I got there she berated me for not coming as soon as I got called, I told her I was in the backstore. 1 hour later she made me come to her office to give me a written warning for that (3 of those and you were fired).

Some weeks later I was scheduled to go for lunch a 11 AM. My shift ended at 6 PM that day instead of 5 PM because I had agreed to help, one employee for the evening shift would come in at 6 instead of 5. I asked another employee if she'd be willing to shift lunch hours, because she was going at 1 PM. She said it didn't bother her. So when the manager came to the front to take the money deposits I asked her if I could switch with that other employee, saying that she'd agreed to it. She flat out said no (it didn't change shit who went to eat when as long as there were enough people on the floor...). I asked ""but I'm staying until 6 PM, do you remember? It's going to feel very long"" she said ""I am the boss, I make the schedule"". 

Few hours later the assistant manager came to take my register stating that the manager wanted to see me in her office. I thought ""what again"" and went. She gave me another written warning for ""insulting her"" in front of customers. I said ""I didn't insult you, I asked you a simple question"" and she replied ""You do not get to question my authority or my decision in front of people, I am your boss"". I signed but I was so furious I went to the bathroom and cried out of sheer anger for half an hour. 

When my day ended and I told the story to my boyfriend I cried in his arms for HOURS because I was pissed BEYOND BELIEF that someone would be so mean just for the sake of being mean. He told me ""I know you wanted to keep the job until we move (we were moving to another city 3-4 weeks later) but this isn't worth it"".

So the morning after I came in a bit earlier, went to the back, put my apron on her desk and said ""I quit. Now."" She said ""you can't do that"" and I said ""I can, and I am. Yell 'I am the boss' long enough and you won't have anyone to boss around anymore."" She said ""YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE YOU GOTTA SIGN PAPERS"" (Umbridge, is that you?). I said ""Well get them out of your ass quickly because I'm leaving as soon as my locker is empty"" (we had small lockers and I had a few papers to collect and shit to throw away). 

The paper I had to sign was to certify that I was resigning and whatnot. There was a question asking basically ""why"". I put the pen on that question, looked at her and said ""do I need to?"" ""n-no this question is not mandatory"" ""thought so"". My personal satisfaction is that another employee had left that week so she had to redo the schedule for the 3rd time in 2 days.

She was a downright awful human being and I don't say that about many people. She fired a part time girl because she ""didn't show up to her shifts"" for a week. The girl was in Cuba with her family and had gotten the approval (verbal only, big mistake) from the boss.

Edit 1: she also liked to reschedule people when they would not see it (say you have 2 days off she'd change it when you had those) so people would either show up for nothing or not show up/show up late and she'd give them hell for it.

Edit 2: she also changed my schedule from 40 hours to 15 one week because I said no to working the night shift she made for 2 weeks (I had just finished 2 weeks of doing 5 AM - 2 PM... thought I'd done my share). The irony is that 2 days later we got the letter that I was now to be considered a full time employee (having worked a certain number of weeks for 30+ hours in a row) so she was under obligation to redo the schedule and give me 30h/week minimum. Lel.

You know all those stereotypes about women? That they're so emotional, so materialistic (I gotta have the most popular brand of [item]!), so shallow, so vapid? There are people, including women, who believe in that bullshit (that 'women' in general are like that) and look down on 'women'. These women think of 'women' as catty bitches, and want to separate themselves from them. It's not joining in the misogyny for the sake of anyone's approval, it's just being misogynistic.

I have a hard time keeping a straight face sometimes because she makes good points and many times is just emulating the adults around her. I was in the passenger seat of our car when my husband had to swerve out of the way to avoid being hit by another car. Before he can say a word a tiny voice from the backseat screams ""gawd dammit that asshat is driving like his butthole is on fire."" My husband and I both shout ""language!"" Her reply ""I spilled my damn juice box."" I got called into the preschool because she stole a sharpie from the teacher's purse and scribbled all over the writing desk. She is sitting next to a little boy her age at the writing desk and the teacher is standing there as well. The rest of the class is playing on the rug across the room very very quietly. All eyes are on my darlin girl and a very tense teacher. The teacher whisper yells the story to me about the desk and darlin girl looks properly contrite... that is until I ask her why she did what she did. She looks me in the eye gets a weird look on her face and busts out a five octave fart. Everytime I try to get a word in when the fart goes down in resonance it starts going up again. It was like the scene in Austin Powers when he keeps peeing and peeing. She finally stops farting and is now giggling so hard she is gasping for breath and the little boy next to her is gagging on the smell. I grabbed darlin girl and tell the teacher we will be in early to clean the desk the next day. Darlin girl shouts over her shoulder at the teacher ""enjoy my present."" That fart was so bad I almost threw up. I lost it when we get to the car and baby girl says ""Tofu. You are going to ask what I have been eating and it was Tofu."" -delivered deadpan serious.

The flag of the Confederate States of America looks like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Flag_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America_%281861-1863%29.svg/255px-Flag_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America_%281861-1863%29.svg.png). What people are displaying all over is the Confederate *battle* flag. There's some leniency in national laws for flying foreign flags -- even those of unfriendly nations. But flying the battle flag of a hostile nation is considered one step removed from treason. Flying the ""Stars'n'Bars"" is tantamount to flying the Japanese Rising Sun flag or the Nazi reichskriegsflagge -- being a declaration of hostile intent toward the United States of America.

Nothing about ""Southern Culture"" (as if there were one single such thing) or ""Southern Heritage"" (again, all over the place). It's glamorizing an act of rich white male landowners not wanting to make any effort to find another way to potentially maintain their lifestyle than on the backs of other human beings they were keeping in crushing ignorance and poverty (white *and* black, often overlooked), and then carried off one of the greatest cons ever by convincing poor *white* Southerners to fight their war for them, on the pretext of ""protecting"" them from the invading imperialist Government, because hey -- at least they weren't *black*.

A whooooole lot of those who answered the call were immigrants from -- or children of immigrants from -- Scotland and Ireland, who had been poor tenant farmers run off their land by their landlords and/or the English to make way for more profitable sheep. So they were already leery of a strong central government which might potentially try to come in and do the same thing here.

Very light skinned black people might be thought of as black among black friends, but tan white among white people.

But, as far as race goes, it's mostly something that society labels you with that you can do little to change, in most cases.

I was really depressed. It was so bad I think I was really starting to die. I would have no energy then pass out in the day time and have nightmares in the middle of the day. *context*

First I quit my job, because memories attached to that job were part of the problem. That just made me more depressed:[ So I tried to get a new job which was hard: I ended up becoming a cab driver. For the first few days, I barely got any rides and mostly sat in the cab looking at myself in the rearview feeling sorry for myself. I would get so sick of feeling miserable that I would go to sleep, and I would have awful nightmares and sleep paralysis. 

Then my job got busy. I was working 10 hrs nonstop driving around. That took my mind off of it at first. But then I kept seeing my ex-girlfriend while I was driving; the one who'd sent me floating down misery creek. It was a small town. I kept seeing her around town with all these different guys. I'd learned from a mutual friend that she'd been hoeing around with different guys while she was seeing me.

I abruptly moved to another city where I didn't know anyone. That made things a little bit better, but I would still have nightmares and sleep paralysis every night.

20521,"Euron Greyjoy.

First, some history. At the time of Aegon's Invasion, the Iron Islands had a massive kingdom on mainland Westeros. King Harren the Black ruled over the Riverlands, as well as (I believe) parts of the Westerlands, the Reach, and the Stormlands. Of course Harren was burned alive by dragon fire in his great castle of Harrenhall, which the rest of Westeros thought was pretty great, because no one, and I mean no one, liked the Iron men and they were more than glad to see them leave. 

So then, for the next couple hundred years, the Iron Islands exist as this isolated mini-state off the coast of Westeros. No one ever really wants to be their ally, nor is anyone willing to let them declare independence. 

Now we get to the events of the show. (Not necessarily the books tho.)

Everyone on the Iron Islands understands that they stand to benefit from chaos on the mainland. Most go back to the old ironborn standard of reaving and raping up and down the coast like the old days. Some consider being able to carve out a mainland kingdom for themselves once again. But Euron is thinking about the bigger picture. 

Sure, they could raid the coasts, and everyone would keep on hating them. Sure, they could capture lands and subjugate the inhabitants, and everyone would keep on hating them. Sure, they could join an invading foreign army and gain a friend on the iron throne, but honestly, most people would still consider them undesirable invaders and keep on hating them.

Or, they could rebrand themselves as the kingdom that saved all of Westeros. They could smash the invading fleet, and be greeted in Kings Landing and Casterly Rock with cheers rather than screams. For the first time in centuries, the Ironborn could be considered friends to the Westerosi. They could start to make long standing alliances. They can start to marry into successful and influential houses. For the first time, since ever, the Ironborn could actually be welcome in Westerosi society and be seen as protectors and not threats.

Euron is trying, more than anyone else, to provide his people with a secure future. He is the only one thinking about the big picture. Everyone else would return the iron Islands to their old second class status. Euron sees that the Islands could have a future as an influential and prosperous nation, and feels that he has a duty as king to see that potential becomes a reality.",AskReddit

He was always my Hero. And so I always tried to be just like him -- as a husband and then as a father. But I thought him perfect, basically, and so I always felt myself lacking, deficient, a failure. Always just a small chip off the 'ol block and never anything more.

If your company has respect for you, they don't manipulate, they talk to you directly, and there isn't any political struggle. They come to you directly with coherent needs and they expect you to follow them and why wouldn't you? You have respect for them. If you have ideas they are receptive because hey: we are all on the same company boat! When they lie to you, mislead you, dangle promotions, etc. It is another way of stating: we don't respect you. We expect you to give yourself to us. If you don't like it: leave (this is when talent leaves, and all your bottom feeders begin their ascent to the top. Your company is dead now, but it'll be years before a real time of death is called. Your company is a zombie now.)

31710,"Clothes really do make the person when it comes to the initial stages of human encounters.  A sense of personal style not only makes the individual more confident but people like to see stimulating things and what else can they go by than how you look (well kept skin and hair and decent physique) and what you wear.  We are an instant gratification society - if you want to increase your odds with the opposite sex, develop a swagger (take bits and pieces from people you admire cosmetically) through clothes/style/passions and cultivate it with your core personality.

I always know many outer circle friends (male and female) that are cool, not ugly (not many people are truly ugly), great personality, ambitious; most of the traits that everyone looks for in suitors.  However, while they are in general clean people (as far as I know); they just do not care about clothes/fashion and making any form of statement with what they wear.  They rationalize and say ""It's just clothes - if a girl/guy likes me it will be for the right reasons and not what I'm wearing"" -- that is a common and false statement so many people live by to their own detriment.

So dressing 'clean and with your own swagger-style' and being confident in who you are (its a cliche but love yourself before you can love someone else is so true) will allow you to mingle with whomever you desire at any point in your journey.  As you work on these things, you'll naturally frequent places where other like-minded suitors will also be enticed to visit.",AskReddit

It's more about self-respect than happiness. If you have problems you're ignoring because you think the ""right person"" coming into your life will fix everything, then you're not taking care of yourself, you're not fulfilling your own needs. 

But if you're dealing with it, taking your meds, going to therapy, working on whatever needs working on, then you're going to be more proud of yourself, and feel like you've got it handled.

I grew up just outside an indian reservation. The elementary school I went to was 90% native and I am white. Of those 90% probably half were told every day of their life that the white man is the reason their life sucked. I do not remember a day where I was not fighting 3-4 of them that were 1-2 years older than me. I was ALWAYS bleeding at school for YEARS. School didn't do shit. Right before middle school (when I was the biggest fish in the pond) a group of them came up and started the usual fare of talking shit about white people. Dumbass said I could use my white privilege and swing first, so I grabbed a lunchroom chair and beat him within an inch of his life infront of his friends. I guess they were shocked but eventually a teacher came and pulled the chair (and me still trying to punch the kid) away. I was suspended and the parents tried to sue for medical expences. The judge said the parents didn't have to pay a dime for their kids treatment and my parents had already paid their family enough through taxes (he was super racist...) I was sent to a special needs school since it was my first major offense (and the judge, again, was suuuuuper racist) and from that point on I never had a problem with being bullied. Ended up in a normal high school after moving and slowly realized how abnormal my elementary school experience was. Its hard to feel bad for the kid but after a few years I realized just about the only reason I didn't end up in Juvenile hall was because I was white. Still wish that res would burn to the ground though...

33426,"""Just talk to them"" is dumb advice.

I mean obviously, you should just talk to them, but it's not that easy. What's needed here is advice on how to get the courage to just talk to them without being excruciatingly awkward. For this, I offer the following;

Play a game in your head. You are a skilled and experienced secret agent, on a mission disguised as an ordinary person. Expertly applied make-up makes you look like an average individual instead of the mind-shatteringly attractive deity you saw in your mirror this morning just after getting out of bed. The person you want, no, *need* to talk to is your mark. You don't know anything about them, except that this morning an anonymous man on the street slipped you an envelope sealed with the official HQ cryptographic seal, containing a photo of your mark, and instructions to find out what you can about them, without them suspecting. HQ wants to know where they're from, what kind of work they do, what they do for fun, their opinions about some things that are in the news, and whatever else you can glean. Any detail about these things may be useful, so don't worry about why HQ wants the information, that's not your job.

So this is a person you *have to* talk to, because it's a matter of national security. You aren't interested in them, and it doesn't matter if they aren't interested in you (but if you can get them to be, that might be useful). You're just having a casual friendly conversation, you don't want them to suspect anything, but whenever there's a reasonable opportunity, you ask a question about them and try to get them talking about themselves. You have to pay close attention because you're going to need to compile a report from memory, and you might hear things that can open up new questions. If you are asked about yourself, talk about your cover story (real life). Keep it plausible and interesting, to make sure they want to stay in the conversation, but don't go on too long, since it's not advancing your mission.

Fun fact: Fake confidence works just as well as the real stuff, and has half the calories. After a little while you may find that the secret agent thing isn't necessary any more, and you're just having an engaging conversation with the person.",AskReddit

I stayed active for a little over a year, worked hard trying to recruit, etc. but I myself was not a Green Beret and had little success.

That night was the final straw. She had me help her move into a new apartment (I was already pissed that we missed out on watching fireworks). It was after 11:00 PM and I knew that we were making too much noise hauling furniture up the stairs. Sure enough, one of the neighbors complained and I told her of this. She then got shitty with me over suggesting that she quiet it down.

It was still hot and I was sweaty, tired and irritable. Having had enough of her shit I lost it and told her to fuck off once and for all. She continued yelling at me as I made my way to the pickup and drove off, spinning gravel and peeling out as I was extremely furious.

Having taken leave of my senses I was driving recklessly through the neighborhood where the streets were narrow and lined with parked cars. I must have been going at least 60 mph. When I approached the main cross street I slammed on the brakes. I skidded through the intersection, and as luck would have it, I did it right as a cop was approaching, so he saw it all happen.

Knowing that I was in trouble, I slowly and calmly made my way back to my newly-ex-girlfriend's apartment. He had the lights on, of course, as he followed me until I stopped about three blocks later. I was arrested for reckless driving. I spent about two hours in the holding cell until I was bailed out.

With the help of an attorney I got the charge reduced to inattentive driving, which meant not having to do jail time, paying a lesser fine and taking a lighter hit to my driving record.

**tl;dr** Got in shouting match with girlfriend, told her to fuck off, drove away pissed, got caught driving like a maniac, got arrested, got bailed out, had charge reduced from reckless driving to inattentive driving.

In its beginning, it had valid points against a group, that tried to bring their politics into both computer- as well as tabletop- and LARP. For no apparent reason, this group had an extremely strong media support despite saying dumb things and doing some shady things. Kotakuinaction had valid and well-argued points against this move to politicise gaming. But time went by and Sarkeesian shifted into obscurance, Atheism+ dissappeared and Kotaku was eventually sold. Many people lost interest into the subs original cause as it had won. Seeing this a-posteriori, it is clear that when the presidential campaigns started, there was a push against the left in general, against the media, and especially against Clinton. In October, the ""both parties are equally bad""-Meme had completely covered that sub. It was taken over by Trumptards who took use of an large, existing community that had gotten somewhat inactive.

We stopped playing with that app after that.

The app that shows you where the ghost is kept showing it hovering by a chair in the corner. So I took pictures like any sane white person would do. I took some with flash, some without. I started to scroll through them to see if I could see anything. The screen would flash between each picture of the chair. Then between every picture. Then the screen just started flashing on and off and changing colors. The second every picture was deleted it went back to normal and it never happened again. I noped the fuck right out of there.

You're supposed to do it because you love it.

Don't be scared of them because they're female... we're human too... so treat them like that instead of girls.

People piss and moan about how expensive it is without knowing that our margins are extremely thin thanks to the production companies demanding absurd prices which go up every year. For example, AMC demanded a 300% increase during our contract negotiations last year even though the only noteworthy show they carry is Walking Dead and the overall viewership of that channel is in decline. As if that's not bad enough, they force us to pay based on our total number of subscribers, not just the ones who actually buy packages that include AMC. And of course we're the bad guys when we're forced to pass the added expense on to our customers. I can't wait until everything is done through streaming and customers can deal with the greedy studios directly themselves - we'll simply be a dumb pipe (Internet) at that point which has much more sane margins.",AskReddit

He did what he was supposed to, what she told him to.  It's just that it was a huge mistake and she wished she could have taken it back, and it ended up contributing to her decision to kill herself.

You're taking that one scene out of context.  Everybody else got through the tapes in a night.  It wasn't supposed to take long, which brings us to the larger point, which is that Hannah didn't think that anybody truly cared about her.  She didn't think that she would be hurting Clay by letting him know all the reasons why.  She was incredibly depressed, she wanted Clay to know because she truly cared about Clay.  Depression does those sorts of things to people, they don't think rationally all of the time.

Lastly, you can inform people of things without saying it's their fault.  That's what she tries to do, yet despite that Clay still feels upset and like it's his fault that Hannah is dead.  That's the point though.  Hannah did not accomplish what she wanted, and an innocent person is left feeling guilty for the death of a person that he truly cared about.    

The whole, ""We all failed her"" thing is representative of society always looking the other way when people are depressed and then acting surprised when people kill themselves.  We ignore cries for help, etc.  It doesn't make it our individual faults, but there is something to say about a society in which this type of thing occurs way too much.",AskReddit

37389,"This sounds a little lame, but it's always worked for me. If you want to strike up a conversation with someone, flattery is always a good openers. Things like 'I like your shoes', or, 'what perfume are you wearing' are great because they show you are interested in the person in a non-creepy way (unless you actually go up to them and sniff them..) and they provide a conversation opener, as opposed to just requiring a yes or no answer. Besides, most people like to know they smell good, or have great taste in shoes. If they didn't care, they wouldn't have spent money on perfume or shoes.

Something else that helps is not being mean to people. Sounds ridiculous, right? I have someone I occasionally hang out with, who always puts me down. Little things like, calling me ""simple and naive"" for watching birthing videos on YouTube (was bored), and calling me ""little and not very smart"" for disagreeing with her. I know she's insecure, but it doesn't endear her to me, and, as a result, I've decided not to be friends with her any longer. I know she thinks she's being cute, ironic and funny but it's not. 

Bottom line, insulting people (even if you think it's funny and ironic and shows what ""great friends"" you are) is not cool. It makes things awkward.

I used to be very terrible at interactions with other people and had little to no social skills, but, through a series of choices, I managed to build up my skills and now I am doing okay! One of the first things I did was make the conscious decision to go out of my way and change that aspect of my life. For me, this happened around 8th grade. I ended up joining the Legislative Debate team in order to bolster my public speaking skills and learn to talk to people. This taught me how to speak and maintain conversations with people, however, it didn't really help with gaining friends and learning how to meet new people. What helped me with this was moving from Michigan to Missouri for college. This forced me wayyy out of my comfort zone and basically left me with the choice to go out of my way and make friends, or know nobody there. It was a rough first couple of weeks, but it taught me how to find common ground with almost anyone, regardless of whether we are similar in personality. It also taught me to be more open to new experiences, as doing something that someone else is interested in/passionate about can go a long way in making friends.

Metacritc numbers

A video game is not a number and can't be described as one and even if 1000 people do not like a game, unless they do give a reason about what it is about and what is bad about it I will never know if I wouldn't still like it, maybe because of the story or the gameplay loop or for the theme alone. Also everyone knows a game that seemingly everyone likes, but that they hate or just can't understand what it is about that others find about it.

Also if I do not know anything about the person who judges the game, a games critic is also useless. I need to understand what someone likes and dislikes in games, if someone is consistent in their judging and if someone is unbiased by everything related to the people making/selling the game.

A number can make a little bit of a sense for one specific game critic/someone who gives first game impressions, if they have their consistent transparent way to make these numbers, but adding all these numbers that were made on complete different rules and mean different things is as stupid as stupid gets.

Pressurized containers/pressure vessels. 

I'm not sure where I developed this fear, but since I was a kid it was something that kind of freaked me out. I'd always feared that something could explode and send shrapnel or a valve into my face and possibly break something or go straight into my brain. 

I did some research online and found very few stuff about [genetic memories] (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/10486479/Phobias-may-be-memories-passed-down-in-genes-from-ancestors.html) which at the time was basically mocked and called a pseudoscience. 

I then also found out that I'd gotten the fear from my dad, who when he was young, was moving some pressurized containers, and another soldier was using them for some reason when somehow one burst in front of my dad and sent a valve flying into the guys face, breaking several bones, and my dad rushed to help with about 3 other guys, the dude was choking on his own blood and it was a very bad situation. Dad never told me what else happened to the guy or if he lived or not, just know that's where I might've gotten that fear from. My dad would be extremely cautious and weary around them, and kind of go around a corner to do other work when people would start fiddling with them. 

I still have this habit...when my dad turns on the propane tank on the grill to start grilling some meat I get really paranoid and go to check up on other stuff inside or what not. I fucking hate being close to them for some odd reason. I can still do work with them, it doesn't stop me, but if I can avoid it, I avoid it. 

It's probably irrational, but you know, I'm paranoid around them.

42977,"There are many problems with this post. First of all, are you fluent in any of these languages? How will you keep the local population from killing you due to superstitions of witchcraft or other beliefs? 

Secondly, have you studied the geographic and economic history of the Baltic Islands? Many times when Europeans have gone to new lands and tried to use farming methods from their areas on the new land they've found that such farming methods don't work. Do you know what the major crops are and how they are best planted? Do you really think that you know better than a farmer who's been working on the same land for his entire life and has knowledge passed down by generations of farmers on that same land? Are you aware that the Baltic islands have relied heavily on the sea and that you might be better off gaining knowledge about fishing? 

Thirdly, you say ""experiment with charcoal, saltpeter, and sulfur"" as if such things are easy to obtain. Where will you acquire sulfur? Saltpeter (ie potassium nitrate) is incredibly difficult to make. Since it takes at least an entire year to make a batch (and that's if you do everything right), it will be some time before you have gunpower, if at all. Since potassium nitrate is dangerous, you'd probably end up killing yourself before you invented gunpowder. 

Fourthly, how do you intend to find this metallurgist and train them in a art which you presumably know nothing about?

Fifthly, how will you avoid all the assassins which will be after you? You are a foreigner. Not many will accept you as a ruler. 

Finally, having taken a course on prehistoric technology in which we attempted to replicate some of these technologies, I can assure you that many technologies that seem simple now are incredibly complex to actually learn and master. So many people in the modern world look down on ancient peoples or HGs as simple and uneducated but, believe me, they managed feats that, without years of skill, training, and passed down knowledge, the vast majority of us would never accomplish.

I had a great chance to talk to someone adamantly not a victim or survivor once, who hated that she had to agree to first being a victim before she could move on with healing the way the narrative worked. Where she felt really horrid was with adults who said ""it's bad when an adult does sexual things with a kid"" without also clarifying that the kids are not by transitive property also bad. You need to be really, really clear that the kid is not to blame and that they will have all the help they need, and can process in their own way--not panic.

Every time I got to that plat 2 it put me with players so far below me that it's like a whole different game. The issue is defense at that level. Golds can play offense almost the same as platinums, but the defensive positions and rotation is where the issue usually lies and it's just so hard to win unless you sit in goal all game and even then you have to hope your team can score. The other issue with that is it takes so many wins to rank up when you play against players that are 3/4 ranks below you that it's impossible to rank up. It's extremely frustrating.

In our family, way back probably around the 19th century, there was man, he was a widower and he had very many children. A few years after his first wife's death he married a very beautiful young woman. Together they had more children. 
After a few years they had too many children and his savings where starting to diminish. He decided that he was not going to share the marriage bed with her, but she was still very beautiful and he could not resist. So she bore him another child. No matter how hard he tried he could not stay away from her. 
Finally he asked a priest for advice on how to resist the sinful desires (at that time sex for any other reasons then procreation was considered sinful). The priest gave him the advice to read the Bible every night. The man did what he was told, but it was still hard to resist and another child was born. Then he found the solution in the bible. He went to the kitchen, found a knife and cut his manhood of. 
He was taken to the doctor and when the doctor asked why he did it he explained his problem and then quoted the bible: 
Matthew (18:8) ""If thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.""

46690,"The costs for FDA drug approval are mostly the testing costs. Let's use a recently FDA approved cancer drug as an example. I do the contracts for this particular late-stage testing, the final stage before FDA approval. This one particular study, on one single cancer indication, requires 300 worldwide study participants for an accurate data group. 145 of these patients are slated to come from the US. We're looking at 3-4 patients per testing site (hospitals/clinics), so we contract with 44 sites at an estimated cost of $3.6 million per site over the life of the study, approximately 2 years unless we get back data that extends the study (usually a good thing for drug development). That's just the site costs for the late stage part of the trial. It doesn't include the production and packaging of the drug, drug shipment costs, the staff costs (staff to review the data, the contracting staff, the patient safety staff, etc.), the investigator meeting costs, travel costs for site visits, the early and middle stages of the trial, and so, so many other costs that are in there for data accuracy and patient safety. And honestly these costs could be much, much higher. When dealing with sites and patient reimbursements and stipends we have a legally-mandated soft ceiling for costs, the Fair Market Value for payments of the type. Without government mandates that costs can't be seen as coercive or an incentive for study participation we'd have to pay out even more. 

And there's only a return on investment if the drug actually works. If it doesn't then that's billions of R&amp;D dollars down the drain that need to be recouped via the drugs that actually do work. Don't blame the FDA mandates for the price of drugs. They're there to keep you safe. The last thing you want to do is allow drug companies to cut corners in drug safety to reduce costs. The pharma company I work for has drugs cheaper in other countries than in the US. Same drug, same testing process, same safety, etc. But the drugs are cheaper there because they are allowed to collectively negotiate prices through their government insurance plan to cover everyone in the country, not piecemeal like in the US. Additionally, the discounts other countries or certain domestic insurers get causes a bump in the prices for everyone else because the drug companies still want to get their profits from somewhere. 

Don't forget about the rules governing generics, either. They are stricter in the US than in other countries, so drug companies elsewhere drop prices to keep their original drug competitive in those markets. ",AskReddit

- Property values when the city is attacked by a giant insect.
- Disposal of all the rubble, aliens, meteors, and giant insect goo by our sanitation department and the tax burden it causes.
- An entire economy based on spandex sales.
- The psychological toll living in a city that is under attack weekly.  How can you do your grocery shopping knowing that, at any moment, your car will animate itself and attack people?
- Why hasn't anyone executed or lynched Lex Luthor?  That guy has more political comebacks than Marion Barry.

&gt;Jon and Paul were the greatest songwriting team in history other than perhaps george and ira gershwin or Gilbert and Sullivan

While they certainly collaborated, most of their best stuff was written by one or the other. It's just that all their songs are credited to Lennon/McCartney no matter who wrote what, because of their publishing deal. Hey Jude was all Paul, Strawberry Fields Forever was all John etc.

&gt;extremely talented players who didn't rely on session musicians except for orchestras and instruments that they couldn't play themselves

They used plenty of session musicians, string sections, brass sections, Indian musicians etc when it suited them. Apart from Billy Preston, their producer George Martin played a lot on their recordings, as well as writing arrangements and solos. Some of their tunes don't even have any Beatles playing instruments on them (Eleanor Rigby, She's Leaving Home, Good Night). I don't think its fair to say that their music was limited by their own abilities.

&gt;Revolver was a more folksy album, they were pretty much trying to emulate Bob Dylan's big shift in 1965

I'm not sure what this means. Revolver is the first album that they made knowing that they'd never have to play any of it live, so they went to town with a bunch of different styles, but I don't really hear much folk influence on that album. Dylan went to rock and roll from folk in '65.

I know I have low self-worth, but I still realize that people value me, no... no, they love me, and that if I can make them a little happier, well then I can thrive another day.

49590,"In western music we have major and minor scales, which originate from patterns of notes called modes. Modes are also scales, but the relationships between the pitches (the order of half and whole steps) are all different. If you want to hear all the different modes go to a piano and play all the white keys from one note to the same note and octave above. (C - C, D - D, E - E, etc). Not all of these scales will be recognizable as major or minor scales. Major and Minor scales are also known as the Ionian and Aeolian modes. They are the most commonly used modes in western music because of the arrangement of the half and whole steps. They just sound good, and if you play all the modes on the piano, you will hear that some of them are very strange sounding. They have big augmented 2cds in strange places, or just don't sound quite settled. For western classical music this makes it difficult to create ""good"" or ""even"" sounding melodies, and you have to remember the main origin of western classical music comes from the church. Most all of early classical music was commissioned for religious ceremonies in church, which limited the ""role"" of the music. Composers were trying to create music for worship, and instinctively the ionian and aeolian modes are the most singable and ""even"" sounding. However the other modes are common in very very early music from Medieval and Renaissance times (infact ""keys"" were not created until the early baroque period when Bach came around, up until then pieces were written in modes) The other modes are also still used today in a lot of Jazz and Rock.

Ok, now for the emotive associations. I go to music school and I have asked my professors why we associate major with ""happy"" and minor with ""sad"", is it programmed into us or are we conditioned to what we hear from birth and take away associations? All of my professors have said these associations are built into our brains. So you can take it at that, or not, as I haven't found any meaningful studies about it online. I am a serious musician though and I believe this. I think you can hear that the minor scale is more wandering, there are no leading tones (half steps leading to either the tonic or dominant) and even when you harmonize a melody in the minor scale it never sounds like there is any kind of strong cadential motion (V - I). In fact, the melodic minor scale which is more common in western music than the natural minor (the pure aeolian mode) ""borrows"" notes from the parallel major so the last 4 notes of the scale sound like they are from a major scale. This was an intentional alteration by early western composers in order to harmonize melodies in the aeolian mode. So overall the aeolian mode own on its doesn't inherently contain a lot of definitive motion, which makes it sound more uncertain, roaming, lost etc. The major scale is just more even in its layout of whole steps and half steps. It's constructed out of two tetrachords of identical relationships between the notes. whole-whole-whole-half, whole-whole-whole-half! It's symmetrical, and there are half-steps acting as leading tones to the two most important notes in the scale, the tonic and dominant. When you hear a major scale, it sounds like a little presentation. I know exactly where it's going. (try singing these words to a major scale, ""I am hungry, so I ate food!"" It's silly but I think it verbalizes the directness of the major scale. It doesn't sound as definitive if you sing it in minor) I think this directness is why the major scale naturally sounds ""happy"" to our ears. Again, I haven't read any written studies to support my point, but my professors and myself have discussed it at length. If you ask somebody in the music world about this I think their opinion will most likely be that these emotive associations are programmed into our brains.

Now, does this vary among cultures? Yes and no. Yes because not all cultures even use the western modes or pitch system, and no because [I believe] any human can naturally hear these associations. Our modes are based on the harmonic series, which is a naturally occurring series of pitches that are created through vibration. If I play a ""C"" on a cello, you are not just hearing the note ""C"" you are hearing a 5th above C, an octave above C, a 4th above C, a 3rd above C etc. Eventually the differences in pitch become too small to notice the difference between notes. This is how the pitches were ""picked out"" in western music, and in a lot of other cultural music around the world. It's a very natural and instinctive way to organize pitches. However, a lot of cultures employ pitches that are closer together than in western music. In middle eastern music or indian ragas, intervals smaller than a semitone are very common. Our western ears may not hear the difference between these semitones, but to those musicians/cultures/people the subtle differences in pitch are noticable and deeply expressive. In eastern music the pentatonic scale, which only has 5 notes, is of great importance. Some cultures don't even focus on pitch. Gamelon music in indonesia is just hitting different kinds of metallophones (xylophones, steel drums etc) and there isn't any kind of true harmonic relationship between any of the notes, but ""pitch"" isn't a structural pillar in that music. Nor is it in a lot of african music, which focuses a lot more on rhythm and the intertwining of of different beats over an ostinato. Basically, not only is ""pitch"" in music not a all-inclusive definition, but it's not even important in a lot of music in the world. I think though, if a non-western person heard a major or minor scale, they would be able to pick out which one is ""happy"" and which one is ""sad"", especially since pop music is all over the world now and is based in the western tonal system. And even if that person REALLY had not heard western music before, I still think they would be able to.

Me and this kid in the neighborhood were friends when I was about 7. Now that I think about it, he was more or less using me for my pool.

At the time I thought it was an awesome plan, but in retrospect I lived in the wrong neighborhood to do any of this shit, especially at age 7.

We had been to about 15 houses at this point, and nobody so far wanted to buy any. However, this one guy decides he wants to buy a set of 50. He seemed like a normal guy, but I got this weird vibe from him. My 7 year old brain didn't care though; I just wanted the money.

The man told us that he didn't have the money and would have to go to the bank. He deeply insisted that we go with him despite our resistance. At that point, my aunt had come speeding down the road and stopped on a dime. She told us both to get in the car, and we did so because we were afraid that we'll get in trouble. She takes the other guy home and I got a deep scolding. My mom was about to file a police report because I was gone for around 8 hours and forgot to mention that I was leaving.

To take a person like that and expose them to widespread and anonymous degradation makes you no better than a schoolyard bully.  It may seem innocent and ok because everyone else is doing it but it isn't.  Plus people now use it off of the internet as well and in a non joking manner.  The next step will be for younger kids to see the older kids they look up to calling people autistic and start doing it themselves, and everyone knows little kids always take it too far.  After that, eventually calling someone autistic will be socially taboo and some new word will come along.  Just like when ""retard"" was the word.

When I was 19, I went to a theme park with two of my best female friends (J and S) during one of the Halloween-themed events. We had an absolute blast at the park and were extremely energized, thanks to great conversations and some energy drinks. Basically, we were young and went a bit nuts with each other, and it was amazing.

After we were done with the park at 3am, I drove us back home while we continued having these great convos for about an hour. We talked about it and decided that we all still weren't tired, so we would try and hang out all night together if we could. 

Unfortunately, all of us were still living with our respective parents at the time, so we had to come up with a game plan. My family was always fast asleep by 11pm or so, so we decided to meet up to spend the night hanging out in my room (which was pretty detached from the other bedrooms in the house, so we could be a bit noisy without disturbing anyone).

So we dropped off J at home because her parents had to verify that she got home safe. Her parents lived within 5 minutes walking distance of my parents, so she would sneak out and meet up with us when she had the chance. 

S lived about 20 mins away, but her parents were very lenient with her and were content to get a phonecall to explain that she had gotten back in town safely and ask if it was alright to spend the night at her friend's place. So, she stayed with me and we went to my place. She stayed outside while I came in through the front door, then I let her into my room through the window.


Now...I need to say that I had a huge crush on S at the time, so I was loving how the night was going. However, she had a boyfriend and I knew I had boundaries to respect. Despite that, she never called him to let him know what the situation was. Didn't seem to even cross her mind at the time.


Anyhow, we were in my room just talking and joking around, waiting to get a text from J to say she was heading over. The text didn't come within 10 mins like we thought it would.

S and I spread out my XL futon (which was doubling as my bed at the time) and watched some episodes of a show for a while, continuing to just talk about whatever came to our minds. We were both really enjoying it. Still no text.

7am comes around and the text never came. We assumed that J was more tired than we thought and fell asleep. We finally started to collapse from the extremely long and active night and slowly dozed off, laying on the futon facing each other and still trying to carry a conversation about our latest music interests. It didn't take long before we both just passed out.

I woke up at about 10:30am, a bit groggy. I remember trying to reposition myself, finding it harder than it should have been to move. Took a second to find out why, and there was S, snuggled up in front of me, my arms fully around her and her arms on top of them. I instantly felt the shock of realization at the situation. I had known this girl for years and had crushed on her for what felt like an eternity. I cared a lot for her and had fantasized about doing exactly this on countless occasions. So, needless to say, I was in heaven.

So I stayed put, simmering in the euphoria. I had never been so relaxed as I was at that moment, and I don't think I have been ever since. 

I fell back asleep after 10 mins or so (was still completely exhausted), not waking up until about 2pm. She was still there, perfect as ever. Then, to my surprise, she asked, ""Hey, you awake?""

I very nearly had a panic attack. Had no idea she was awake, and didn't know if she had been awake for a while. I luckily managed to calm down my addled teenage brain enough to realise that she wasn't shoving me off of her or screaming at me with accusations. She had actually sounded as relaxed as I had felt before she spoke.

I confirmed I was awake, and we got up. I decided not to bother hiding her presence from the rest of my family, mostly because we didn't do anything that warranted hiding from them. So, we went out to the kitchen and made some breakfast together.

She wasn't weird about it, and neither was I (I hope). We didn't talk about it directly, but we both seemed to feel completely comfortable with it, even though she knew she probably shouldn't have stayed the night in not-her-boyfriend's room in the first place.

Nothing ever come of it, but I would relive this night over and over again if I could.

&gt;I was once on a US military ship, having breakfast in the wardroom (officers lounge) when the Operations Officer (OPS) walks in. This guy was the definition of NOT a morning person; he’s still half asleep, bleary eyed… basically a zombie with a bagel. He sits down across from me to eat his bagel and is just barely conscious. My back is to the outboard side of the ship, and the morning sun is blazing in one of the portholes putting a big bright-a** circle of light right on his barely conscious face. He’s squinting and chewing and basically just remembering how to be alive for today. It’s painful to watch.

&gt;But then zombie-OPS stops chewing, slowly picks up the phone, and dials the bridge. In his well-known I’m-still-totally-asleep voice, he says ‘heeeey. It’s OPS. Could you… shift our barpat… yeah, one six five. Thanks.’ And puts the phone down. And then he just sits there. Squinting. Waiting.

&gt;And then, ever so slowly, I realize that that big blazing spot of sun has begun to slide off the zombie’s face and onto the wall behind him. After a moment it clears his face and he blinks slowly a few times and the brilliant beauty of what I’ve just witnessed begins to overwhelm me. By ordering the bridge to adjust the ship’s back-and-forth patrol by about 15 degrees, he’s changed our course just enough to reposition the sun off of his face. He’s literally just redirected thousands of tons of steel and hundreds of people so that he could get the sun out of his eyes while he eats his bagel. I am in awe.

&gt;He slowly picks up his bagel and for a moment I’m terrified at the thought that his own genius may escape him, that he may never appreciate the epic brilliance of his laziness (since he’s not going to wake up for another hour). But between his next bites he pauses, looks at me, and gives me the faintest, sly grin, before returning to gnaw slowly on his zombie bagel.",AskReddit

It was going to be awesome, overnight, in cabins, by a lake, with boys. I had the permission slip turned in, a sleeping bag bought, and I was more than ready to go. 1 week before the trip I was on the playground bouncing a basketball, and some little jerk took it away from me. I went and told my teacher to tell him to give it back because he stole it from me, and he wouldn't, he said, you can get it back yourself. At the time he was my favorite teacher, but this infuriated me, I got so mad that I called him a butt hole for not getting the ball for me. He kinda laughed and I said, no I'm serious. That jerk wrote me up and I wasn't allowed to go on the camping trip! It was so ridiculous, especially since I had never been written up before and was a straight A student. I still run into him to this day, and his wife is my hairdresser, but my blood still boils when I see him. He deprived me of a great childhood memory!

Last year she was driving my sister home after they had run some errands, including picking up a prescription for a new medication for my sister. My sister took it in the car on the way home.

By the time the ambulance arrived, my sister was partially conscious. She was released from the hospital later that day, thankfully. She underwent testing to make sure it wasn't a neurological condition, but everyone is certain it was the medication.

My mom told me that it's the first time she ever seriously feared that one of her children was going to die, right there in front of mer. My sister's pulse had dropped significantly and her breathing was very shallow. She's told me that she's glad she had the wherewithal to react as quickly and effectively as she did by getting my sister on the ground and calling 911.

Likewise, Europe isn't just one thing, there are lots of areas with huge distances here as well. Take northern Norway for instance. I live 5 hours by (a very expensive) bus from the nearest train station (not high speed trains). Airfares are insanely high and there are few planes each day.  My town has everything you need for daily life, but it's 3 hours by car from the next proper town and 5 hours from the next 'city'. Only a few areas are connected to the city centre with regular buses (every half hour in the middle of the day, every hour after 6pm), in the weekends and in some areas there are usually no more than 3-4 buses in a day, none 'late' at night. We pay 4-5 dollars for each trip, even if it's less than 5 minutes long. In addition, gas is extremely expensive, so owning a car might not help much. The landscape is very steep in most areas, making bikes impractical. And I live in a very connected place compare to smaller 'towns' in the area.

62073,"&gt;This is a big one: Income inequality has increased dramatically over time in the US.

This is something politicians really hit on hard, and I don't deny the trend is troubling. But there is also GOOD news economically: The size of the American middle class is shrinking. That may sound like bad news initially, until you look at the data and realize the reason there are fewer people in the middle (and lower) income bracket because people are moving into the upper income bracket.

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/01/25/upshot/shrinking-middle-class.html

What I got from these data:

- The percentage of American housholds earning less than $35K (inflation adjusted) fell from 40% in 1967 to 34% in 2013.  
- The percentage of households in the middle income bracket fell from 53% in 1967 to 43% in 2013.
- Meanwhile, the percentage of households in the upper income bracket (earning more than $100K) increased from from 7% to 22% in 2013.

This tells me that overall, the American middle class is shrinking because people are generally getting richer, not poorer.

&gt;Nobody forces you to read the discussions going on. You aren't forced to do anything.

&gt;You take it upon yourself to inform the religious why they're living their lives wrong.

Yes. Just like I would do if someone said that the Patriots didn't suck. Religion gets no special pass.

&gt;Would you do the same thing to an obese person?

If they were sitting against a wall with a sign that said, ""Am I fat, please comment,"" then, if I chose to do so, fuck yes.

&gt;Would you walk up to them while they're eating a cheeseburger and tell them what they're doing wrong with their life?

No. But this analogy does not apply to this situation of someone posting something on reddit public space. Shit. That's the whole point of reddit. Is it supposed to be a big agreement-fest? No one comments on nothing at all? This is bizarre.

&gt;If someone is forcing their beliefs on you (politicians and unknown meddling fucktards), I'm all for taking a stand.

Me, too.

&gt;However, the redditors probably aren't doing that 

They are. People argue on everything here. Anyone who doesn't realize that needs to get educated real fast.

&gt;if you've paid enough attention in the religious subreddits, most of the redditors are for separation of church and state. They realize that forcing their beliefs on someone who doesn't believe the same is fucking idiotic.

Why do people get so butt-hurt when one intellectually violently disagrees on something like politics, but religion thinks it gets a free pass, and should never be commented on, even when they say something patently false? This happens on reddit all the time.

&gt;I'm sorry, but when I see your posts, the majority of the time I see arguments that are comparable to questions like ""OMG You don't believe in God? How could you not believe in God? You know you're going to Hell, right?""

Um, just go look at my last few posts. They are nothing like that.  I'm talking Kant, process theology, continental theology, Salk vaccine, or Watson/Crick,  Noyce, North-Whitehead.

I don't think that this compares to ""OMG You don't believe in God? How could you not believe in God? You know you're going to Hell, right?"":

Good:  People tend to be pretty outdoorsy and active.  There are a lot of beautiful places to go and hike.  The winters are great.  They're not very cold at all.  It doesn't snow all the time, but when it does, we get a shit ton.  I like that there's no snow, no snow, BAM! SNOW!, then it all melts in a few days.  I stay because family is here, which is very helpful with little kids.

Bad:  The food is terrible.  Other than a downtown Denver, most people don't support mom &amp; pop shops.  Almost all restaurants and stores are national chains.  Although people are very outdoorsy and active, almost no one walks places outside of a small area downtown.  Everyone drives to go places.  People are very into hunting and gun rights.  People here tend to be very against taxes and programs that help the poor &amp; disabled.  We have some of the highest drug use in the country (which is not good when you're raising kids), and there are medical marijuana clinics EVERYWHERE, which is, again, not good when you're raising little kids.  There are a lot of affluent people, too, and they tend to be very greedy with their money.  The wealthiest buy large acres of land and keep just enough animals to be able to call their land ""agricultural"" and not pay residential taxes.  This type of entitled attitude really upsets a lot of disgruntled youth, and we end up with a lot of school shootings, mall bombings, etc.  Festivals and the like are few and far between (as compared to other places I'm familiar with) and generally don't attract many people.  People here tend to keep to themselves, as compared to some places that are very community-oriented.  Summers are extremely dry, and they're usually followed by ""fire season.""  This year is a welcome exception.  We have very little cloud coverage because we're up so high.  It sounds nice, but the sun is brutal.  It sucks to always have to wear sunglasses outside.  Also, springs and falls (my favorite seasons) tend to be non-existent.  Most years, it'll jump from the 40s of winter to the 80s of summer in a matter of a couple weeks.  This year, again, was a nice exception.  Although winters are great, we don't fund our cities very well.  They basically never salt sidewalks or streets, and they usually run out of money for plowing.  Main streets are usually plowed, but side streets are almost never plowed.

TL; DR: Colorado has high drug use, and the people tend to keep to themselves.  There are a lot of school shootings, mall bombings, etc.  Winters rule, but the other seasons really bite.

63855,"No worries. I'm glad you're interested in NPR, because that's the sort of work I do. I'm at a public station in Ireland now. My first job was at an NPR member station.

How old are/have you gone to college yet? To work for NPR or member stations, you'll pretty much need a degree. 

It's also worth nothing that you should focus on reporting skills first and foremost. NPR isn't looking for masters of radio necessarily. They are looking for masters of reporting. It's easier to learn radio. 

Also what is your local station? (I realize now it sounds bad that I'm asking for your age and location)

Depending on those two things, your local station might be looking for help. I got really lucky with my first gig and just walked into the station, talked with someone I knew, and they told me to apply for a weekend announcing position.

It's unfortunate that presentable for a female means they wear some make up, but I've grown to like it.

I'm confident in myself, including the fact that I like to wear make up, dresses with converse, and whatever else I feel like.

Everyone going 35 would be safer than everyone going 45, therefore decreasing the average travel speed in that area. That could be accomplished by stricter monitoring of that area and enforcement of the speed limit, which is the first point the WHO article makes about how to increase safety. I again say that I'm going to maintain the speed limit, regardless if everyone around me isn't. If the crash into me, that's their fault and assuming I'm injured, I would absolutely pursue legal action against them. Just because everyone else is doing something they shouldn't be doing doesn't make it okay. It would be safer if *everyone* followed the speed limit, which is why I don't consider matching the flow of traffic if everyone else is speeding to be a valid point, because it's unsafe. I don't care if it's less unsafe than maintaining my current driving speed; I would rather have the safest possible condition in the first place, rather than settling for the lesser of two evils.

You don't see it because McDonald's stole the concept from the Kroffts, got the bejeezus sued out of them and lost. 

McDonalds lost the rights to about half of their characters and phased out the ""McDonaldland"" concept that was ""inspired"" by HR Pufnstuf.

66209,"My ex was a photographer. I took all her photos from the previous year and got a program to make a photo mosaic of a really badass picture of her, out of all of her photography. I printed poster sized and framed it. That's probably the coolest.

For last father's day I bought my dad a copy of the Departed and photoshopped a picture of him smoking a cigar all gangster like onto the cover.

The most tedious one was also for the photographer ex. She really wanted to see this show, VH1 The Shot (a reality show about photographers), but the show bombed and they never even released a season DVD set. I had to buy the episodes off of Amazon, and then a couple from itunes, figure out how to remove the ridiculous DRM off of both of them in order to burn them to DVDs. I also ripped all the extra material and deleted scenes from the VH1 website so each disc could have a bonus content section. Then I set up DVD menus and burnt each disc on a printable disc, and designed the disc labels and DVD covers. It really should have been way easier than it was. The DRM bit was the most ridiculous part.

""It is in the German memoir 'Sniper on the Eastern Front'. It is March 1945, and the Germans have been pushed back by the Russians into Germany and Czechoslovakia. He was scouting some German village in the Sudetenland. A Russian platoon drove around, so he hid in a caved out building, so this lone sniper had a front row seat to the horror to what was to follow. The platoon was plundering the village until it ran into this German couple. The Russians then tied up the husband, and forced him to watch as the Russians, in order of ranking personnel, raped the wife. One. By. One. She was screaming in agony, fell in and out of consciousness, and was in so much pain. When the last Russian was finished with her, he shoved a flare gun up the woman's vagina, and fired it. The woman screamed out the most 'animalistic, brutal, and haunting scream' the German has ever heard, as the flare was slowly burning the woman's insides and blood/flare residue/flames were rushing out of her body, and then she slumped over dead. German reinforcements soon arrived, and killed/wounded the platoon. The husband went into his house, grabbed an object (I recall it was a shovel) and hacked the remaining wounded Russians on the ground until they were all dead. Some of the Germans tried stopping him, but the lone sniper held them back.""

You hit the nail on the head, I agree that you can't fully prove or disprove either side of the argument, but what I do know is that it is undeniable a higher intelligence designed us, and the only viable choice is the God of Adam, Abraham, and Moses. The creation story fits the discovery of science. Other religions, Muslims/Hindus/Buddhism all have painfully obvious errors, and they don't even try to prove there origin stories.

Your asking for my articles and research documents? I can direct you to a few good websites and videos of seminars if you like.  But I was really hoping just to hash it out man to man with what knowledge we both have. I don't like it when people link me to some ridiculously long boring article that neither of us actually understand. It's kind of like passing the buck, I'll do it only by request. 

I watched the video, and ken didn't do a great job answering. But I suppose you can water down my response to 'nothing will change my mind ' but I did say a time machine would do the trick (I'm aware the science is impossible). However, the problem is you're giving me a question that's like saying, what evidence would you need to believe 2+2=3? Well, nothing, because the truth is etched into my heart,  my soul. 


RCD hasn't been found faulty for it's rate of decay? There's no experiment to test it, it requires millions of years. 

I do believe many scientists are pushing an agenda, many of them hate God and spew bile at the thought of intelligent design. But not all,  probably not even half are like that. What I'm saying is most scientists have been taught that creationism is simply impossible and the only choice they have is evolution. So they push it because that's what they were brain washed into. I've heard statistics that say most people who work and research in the field of the sciences believe in a higher power, I hope that's true. 

Humans were designed prefect until we screwed it up with sin. But, regardless, our bodies are incredible machines, way to complex for a series of lucky chances to have mutated us into who we are. Are you familiar with the pocket watch in a field analogy? 

Evolution is a religion, you take it on faith that billions of years have passed, you take it on faith that we spawned from some primordial soup, you believe this because a book told you so.

69872,"&gt;Whilst this sounds pretty major, I've been able to ignore it  

I'm going to tell you something that will seem harsh at first.  
My mother has RP. She did the ""I'm not really blind yet"" denial thing for ten years, from when I was 13 to 23. When her vision finally degenerated to the point where she couldn't pretend anymore, she lost it. Total mental breakdown. She was never a nice person before, but after she recovered she was a complete bitch. She gives herself a free pass to say anything to anyone, no matter how hurtful, under the guise of ""advice"" or ""truthfulness"". It's very clear from the outside that she considers herself so unfairly punished by the blindness that she gets to take it out on everyone around her in return. (this is not just a bitter child talking, this is a diagnosis...)

I have a good friend who is also blind, but she lost it overnight from diabetes complications. She has a good life. She's warm, positive, interested in other people, and doesn't bother with most special-treatment options like handicapped bathrooms or parking spaces. She's also done quite a bit of social/therapeutic work with blind people and told me something I hadn't known:  

RP has a reputation in the blind world as ""the crazymaker"" precisely because of the gradual onset and the chance to develop entrenched habits of denial.  

People with RP often are not offered support/counseling because of that same slow onset. They often suffer longterm but quiet depression, and often have a harder time coping in the end than people whose blindness comes on suddenly, presents them with a more ""deal with it"" situation. My mother is actually somewhat typical. 

Mackyt, it truly deeply sucks to be you. RP is a bastard. If you aren't letting yourself know this, if the people around you aren't giving you the support you need, GO FIND IT. START NOW. Get a good therapist and check in often.  Be proactive about being good to yourself.  

Oh, and OP? Go ahead and have those kids. Anything my mother sucked at as a mom was from lack of heart, not from her lack of vision. I've got a bunch of blind parent friends and they're doing just fine. ",AskReddit
69913,At 11 years old when my dad made me work in the family restaurant busing tables. I haven't stopped working since. It taught me a lot. It's too bad most young people today no longer get the opportunity to work at a young age. ,AskReddit
69915,"I did a little digging into his comment history. From what I can tell, he's a late-50's electrical engineer.

The problem is that a lot of his points are poorly internally reconciled. Some of them are fine. I don't think that anyone here disagrees that people have to make their own mistakes in their lives to learn. That 'Curse of Cassandra' (seeing what will happen, but being helpless to change it) aspect is one of the hardest parts about parenting.

That being said: Progress isn't a religion. A religion has at its core a ""transcendental ethic"", a rule that is more important to follow (for believers) than the rule of normal ethics, such as protecting the rights of others, for the purposes of a ""transcendental reward"". This is why the religious feel comfortable firebombing planned parenthood clinics, for example. Progress, broadly defined, is the state of moving society as a *whole* to a state where mundane ethics, not transcendental ethics, are more respected.

The ""pussy and money"" thing is vacuous. First of all, money isn't an end in itself. People USE money for things, mostly, the satisfaction of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. *Those* are ends. But, this means that if there were an alternate means to satisfy them other than money, than it would no longer be part of this faulty duality.

Extreme ideologies are religions... sure. But you're conflating ideology with philosophy, which is not correct, and extremism is a relative term that is often applied by the party being critiqued by the ""extremist"". For example, [John Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brown_(abolitionist), the abolitionist, was ultimately proved correct. We now all agree slavery is an unconscionable evil, and he was right: it did take an armed conflict to secure its destruction, even though slavery was just one reason for the Civil War. John Brown's philosophy was not lacking. It was inconvenient, and required more of people than was comfortable, but... too bad. ",AskReddit
