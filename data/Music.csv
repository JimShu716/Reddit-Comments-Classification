I like Manchester Orchestra's recently released album Simple Math.  I give Simple Math an 8.5/10.

&gt; Amos Lee (born 1978 as Ryan Anthony Massaro) is an American singer-songwriter whose musical style encompasses folk, rock and soul. His self-titled debut album is full of folk and soul, with a jazz twist.  The Flower Songfacts state that his fourth album, Mission Bell, which was released on January 25, 2011 debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 with 40,000 copies sold in its first week; these sales were the lowest for a #1 debut in the Nielsen SoundScan era.

&gt; Lee grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Cherry Hill, New Jersey, USA. He has been quoted as saying that he is fortunate to have seen different sides of life in America. Lee enrolled at the University of South Carolina in 1995. He began to play guitar and write songs seriously while he studied English. After graduating with an English degree, Lee moved back to Philadelphia to teach elementary school. He later made the tough decision to stop teaching in order to pursue a career in music. Shortly thereafter, he released a self-produced EP that featured five of his original songs, which did extremely well in Philadelphia and created a buzz. Norah Jones was the person who finally gave Lee his big breakthrough when she asked him to open for her 2004 tour. Lee then went on to produce his self-titled debut album. In March and April of 2005 Lee opened for the tour that Merle Haggard and Bob Dylan were both embarking on, all 3 performers were extremely well received by critics as the tour went by, with Dylan receiving some of his strongest reviews in years. On October 3, 2006, Lee released his second album, ""Supply &amp; Demand"" to critical and commercial acclaim.

&gt; At the age of only 27, Amos Lee has enjoyed notable success with his debut album and looks to have a promising future in the music business. His favorite artists and sources of inspiration include Stevie Wonder, Neil Young, John Prine, Bill Withers, and James Taylor. Read more on Last.fm.

388,"I guess if you say so. I've never found anything about country music as a genre lovable personally. Some individual songs I might like, or at least tolerate, but as a whole... just... no. Maybe it's the years so long ago that I played in a country music band (still didn't like the music.. well, was more indifferent than didn't like it then, but it was the only thing you can play in bars here down south), and witnessed way to much good old boy bad behavior. Of course, being a female drummer, some of that was directed towards me... whenever their wife/gf would have their back turned.

Bored as hell for most of it, the three instrumentals together just never did anything for me and I was nearly asleep, drifting in and out of consciousness.

Faaip de Oiad came on and was, when drunk alone at night at full volume, the most intense, uncomfortable, and terrifying musical experience I've ever had.

&gt; Hailing from Austin, Texas, the members of 13th Floor Elevators were one of the first artists to describe their music as psychedelic. Their lyrics and sleeve notes openly and religiously endorsed the use of drugs (particularly LSD) to alter human consciousness for the better. 

&gt; The band rattled to the middle of the Hot 100 in 1966 with You're Gonna Miss Me, anchored by Roky Erickson's unforgettable yelping vocals, Stacy Sutherland's guitar, and Tommy Hall's electric jug runs. According to myth, Tommy's jug was tuned by the amount of marijuana stored in it.

&gt; The group pioneered some of the first garage psychedelia on its albums The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators 1966, and the followup Easter Everywhere 1967. 

&gt; However, Texas at that time was an extremely conservative area that still hadn't come to terms with 50's rock 'n' roll. The authorities and the police set out to bust the entire band for pot (and—not surprisingly—succeeded).

&gt; Stacy Sutherland was jailed. To avoid a prison term, Roky pleaded insanity—a misguided ploy that landed him in Rusk State Hospital for the criminally insane for 3 years. That turn of events spelled the end of the band, although there was a posthumous 1968 LP, Bull of the Woods. 

&gt; Roky Erickson was released from hospital in 1973 and embarked upon a successful solo career that resulted in a CBS album produced by Stu Cook from Creedence Clearwater Revival. During the 1980s he struggled with mental illness and withdrew from public life for many years. However, in the 2000s he has re-emerged with one of his late 70s/early 80s backing bands, The Explosives, playing regular gigs including the Austin City Limits festival in September 2005, as well as Coachella in California, the Hultsfred Festival in Sweden and Montreal World Film festival in Canada.

Spotify is actually backed (and partly owned/funded) by the major record companies. It's easily the biggest database of of music available for streaming, and it does so in 384 kbps Ogg Vorbis, which is pretty fucking close to FLAC/WAV/AIFF.

Furthermore, the application itself is clean, easy, intuitive and fast. It's one of the best applications released in the last few years. It does exactly what it's supposed to, it never crashes (I actually haven't had it crash on me once, and I've had it since early beta), it's fast, no bloat, and additions are always small and welcome.

Grooveshark isn't really comparable (in my opinion). It's not even in the ballpark. The selection is rubbish, and it's mostly uploaded in horrible quality by people without spelling abilities whatsoever. Spotify is high bitrate Ogg Vorbis all around, and it's uploaded by the actual content providers, which means it's usually 100% correct. When a new album is released, it's usually already on Spotify. In near CD quality.

Also, as others noted (and I mentioned in brief), Spotify is a project backed by the industry. The artists get money out of it (however small the sum). Right now there are issues (because of the transition from the free model to the payment model), artists aren't paid enough, but in the future, this will be the officially (or one of the officially) backed service(s); and it will be a legitimate way for artists to make real money.",Music

I would just counter what you were implying a little bit by saying apart from just the run of the mill song writers, a lot of the people penning the songs were legit artists like Wilson Pickett, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, Staple Singers, Isaac Hayes,  and later people like Michael Jackson, etc...

I mean (if you flash forward about 10-12 years) Prince is a good example of this himself. He probably had a period in the mid 80s where he wrote/produced more music for other people than he released for himself while also still being one of the most popular solo artists who played his own instrument. 

The difference between Prince and Dr. Luke is that Prince's talent, personality, bravado, imagery, etc... are all rooted in an artistic persona, where as Dr. Luke is a dude who makes a lot of money and [looks like a substitute teacher](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Music-dr-luke.jpg). Not trying to insult the guy, but my comment was more about how music lost its ability to churn out both artists and songwriters in the same person. Now you have artists and you have songwriters.

&gt; Oasis were an English rock band that formed in Manchester in 1991. Originally known as The Rain, the group was formed by Liam Gallagher (vocals and tambourine), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Paul McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums, percussion), who were soon joined by Liam's older brother Noel Gallagher (lead guitar and vocals).

&gt; Its members were signed to independent record label Creation Records and released their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe in 1994, including hits like Live Forever and Supersonic.

&gt; The following year, the band recorded the critically acclaimed (What's the Story) Morning Glory? with their new drummer Alan White that led to international success propelled by singles Wonderwall, Don't Look Back in Anger and Champagne Supernova. In 1997, Oasis released third album and became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history, aside Michael Jackson's Bad. McGuigan and Arthurs left the band as they went on to record and release Standing on the Shoulder of Giants and were replaced by Gem Archer and Andy Bell who joined the group for the recording of Heathen Chemistry.

&gt; In August 2009, Noel Gallagher announced his departure from the band. Liam Gallagher initially stated that Oasis were ""done"", but later in February 2010 announced that the remaining members of the band would continue to record music, and did not rule out the possibility of retaining the Oasis name. However, Liam and other former members of the band are instead continuing under the name Beady Eye and Noel has formed Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.

&gt; 2. American rock band:  Oasis was an American rock band from Marin County, California active in the 1970s. Their sound has been described as psychedelic folk rock, progressive folk and psychedelic pop, characterized by male/female harmonies. With the help of David Crosby of famed Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, they recorded one album, Oasis, released on the Cranbus label in 1973.

&gt; Members Shelly Fox was previously in Cookin Mama, and Stephen Barncard also worked with Chet Nichols and David Crosby. Kelly Bryan had earlier been in the short-lived Grootna, and later played on a couple of albums by Jesse Colin Young.

&gt; Between 1971 and 1978 members of Oasis also recorded under the name RJ Fox and completed an album for Atlantic in 1971 which was never released. A double disc collection of Oasis and RJ Fox material was compiled by the Black Bamboo label in 1998. RJ Fox: Retrospective Dreams included the lost LP, tracks from the Oasis album and many others.

&gt; 3. American deep house producers: Oasis is a collaboration between Omar-S (Alex O. Smith) and Shadow Ray from Detroit.

&gt; 4. British classical group: Oasis was a short-lived English classic group active through 1984-1988 featuring Peter Skellern, Julian Lloyd Webber (later replaced by Audrey Riley), Mitch Dalton, Bill Lovelady and Mary Hopkin. Oasis released only self-titled album and two singles and toured till 1988.

&gt; Village People is a Disco band that formed New York City, New York, United States in 1977. The group is well known for their outrageous on-stage costumes (the members dressing up as a police officer, an American Indian chief, a construction worker, a soldier, a leatherman (biker) and a cowboy) as for their catchy tunes and suggestive lyrics.

&gt; The band was assembled in 1977 and managed by two French musicians, Jacques Morali and Henri Belolo, specifically to showcase and perform their disco music creations. Much like Frank Farian's Boney M. or Spice Girls, the group was manufactured. Despite the French song writers, the songs were all in English.

&gt; The band's name references a well-known gay area of New York City, Greenwich Village. Jacques Morali and Henri Belolo got the inspiration for creating an assembly of American man archetypes based on the gay men of the Village who frequently dressed in various fantasy ways. The police officer character is said to have been inspired by an actual Sacramento County (California) Sheriff's Deputy - David Orth.

&gt; The United States Navy considered using the Village People hit ""In the Navy"" in a recruiting advertising campaign on television and radio. They contacted Belolo, who decided to give the rights for free on the condition that the Navy help them shoot the music video. Less than a month later, Village People arrived at the San Diego Naval base. The Navy provided them with a war ship, several airplanes, and hundreds of Navy men. When the video started showing and the Navy started the planned ad campaign, some newspapers protested using taxpayer money to fund music videos (especially for a group considered by some to be ""morally dubious""). The Navy quickly cancelled the campaign. The scandal tremendously boosted the popularity of the song.

&gt; Other hits include their trademark ""Macho Man"", ""Go West"", and ""YMCA"". More than twenty years later, a dance that involves forming the latter four letters with the dancer's arms and legs is still popular at summer camps, office functions, wedding receptions, school dances, sporting events and B'nai Mitzvahs. In the middle of the seventh inning of each baseball game at Yankee Stadium, the grounds crew take an on-field break from grooming the infield to dance as ""YMCA"" is played, typically to enthusiastic cheers from the fans.

&gt; An interesting fact about the Village People recordings is that all of the background vocals for their best known recordings where provided by 2 session musicians who went on to front notable bands; Bill Champlin from Chicago, and Richard Page (musician) from Mr. Mister.

&gt; The group also appeared in their 1980 feature film Can't Stop the Music, directed by Nancy Walker, written by Allan Carr and Bronte Woodard, music and lyrics by Jacques Morali and starring Steve Guttenberg, Valerie Perrine, Bruce Jenner, and Village People. The movie ""won"" the Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay prizes at the 1980 Golden Raspberry Awards in March 1981 and was nominated in almost all the other categories.

&gt; In 1981, with the popularity of disco waning and New Wave music on the rise, Village People replaced their on-stage costumes with a new look inspired by the New Romantic movement, and released the New Wave album Renaissance; it was not a commercial success.Victor Willis returned to the group briefly in late 1981 for the album Fox on the Box, which was released in 1982 only in Europe but did have limited release in the United States in 1983 under the title In the Street. Miles Jaye had briefly taken over for Ray Simpson as lead singer by 1983 and contributed an extra track to In the Street. Mark Lee replaced David Hodo in 1982.

&gt; Their last album containing new material, the 1985 dance/Hi-NRG release Sex Over the Phone, was not a huge commercial success, but it fared better in sales and club play than their Renaissance album. The title track, when released as a single, was banned by the BBC because of its content - credit card dirty phone calls. The Sex album featured yet another new lead singer, Ray Stephens (of The Great Space Coaster fame). Py Douglas came in to sub for Stephens for some of the group's live appearances in 1985.

&gt; In 1985, the group took a hiatus but reunited in 1987 with the line-up of Randy Jones, David Hodo, Felipe Rose, Glenn Hughes, Alex Briley and Ray Simpson.

&gt; Since 1988, the group has managed itself under the name Sixuvus Ltd.

&gt; In 1994, the Village People joined the German national soccer team to sing its official World Cup '94 theme, ""Far Away in America.""

&gt; Starting in 2004, Village People performed as the opening act for Cher in her Farewell Tour until it ended in April 2005.

&gt; From July 18th to July 20th, 2004, Village People performed in Berlin for three shows as an opening act for the German punk band Die Ärzte.
On May 8, 2012, Victor Willis wins a landmark ruling in the first case heard regarding the Copyright Act of 1976 which allows recording artists and writers to reclaim their master recordings and publishing rights initially granted to record companies and publishers after 35 years.

&gt; In April 2013, Village People recorded ""Let's Go Back To The Dance Floor"" -- a song written by Harry Wayne Casey (KC &amp; The Sunshine Band) and produced by DJ Julian Marsh.   Read more on Last.fm.

I often hear from friends that they can't stand a particular band because certain musicians are not good. I always hear this about the White Stripes from alot of people for example. 

I do not agree that the White Stripes would be just as popular without Meg. For one thing, as I mentioned before, Jack says himself that there was something so raw and primal about Megs drumming that it unleashed this side of him that played his guitar a certain way. That is what makes the White Stripes so good IMO. Besides, look at The Dead Weather, (Jack's new project), they have a good drummer and Jack is writing the songs and they are not very popular. The Raconteurs are not as popular as the White Stripes were either and they are awesome musicians. So it does not just require Jack White to be very widely accepted or ""good"".",Music

If you haven't heard of their New Years' Eve shows, or their festivals, or their ambient beach-ball jams where they would play a note every time a giant bouncing beach-ball would land on the crowd.. Or how they would ""dress up"" as a band on Halloween and play an entire album of theirs all the way through...

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/85bde6d16cb34800c86670001cfa3615.png)  

&gt; Giorgio Moroder (born Hansjörg Moroder on April 26, 1940 in Ortisei, Italy) is an Italian record producer, songwriter and performer, whose groundbreaking work with synthesizers during the 1970s was a significant influence on new wave, techno and electronic music in general. Particularly well known are Donna Summer's disco hits produced by Moroder, including ""Love To Love You Baby"" and ""I Feel Love"". Moroder also produced a number of electronic disco hits for The Three Degrees.

&gt; Often collaborating with lyricist Pete Bellotte, Moroder scored a number of hits in his own name including ""Son Of My Father"" in 1972 and ""From Here to Eternity"" in 1977 under the name Giorgio, and in the following year releasing ""Chase"", the theme from the film Midnight Express and sold well elsewhere. All were hits in the UK. The full movie score for Midnight Express won him his first Academy Award for best film score in 1978.

&gt; In 1985, Moroder worked with Phil Oakey, frontman of the popular synthpop group, The Human League, to make the album Philip Oakey &amp; Giorgio Moroder. The following year, Moroder collaborated with his protege Harold Faltermeyer (of ""Axel F."" fame) and lyricist Tom Whitlock to create the score for the popular film Top Gun (1986), with the most noteworthy hit being the Berlin classic, ""Take My Breath Away"", which went on to become a huge hit for the group.

&gt; He also scored other popular films in the 1980s including American Gigolo, Flashdance, The NeverEnding Story, Thief of Hearts, Electric Dreams, Scarface and Cat People(in collaboration with David Bowie). The latter score has recently regained popularity due to its use in the popular computer game Grand Theft Auto III. Moroder's ""From Here To Eternity"" and ""The Chase"" were also used in the Sony PSP game Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. 

&gt; In 1984, Moroder compiled a new restoration and edit of the famous silent film Metropolis and provided a new modern rock-and-roll soundtrack to the film. 
His song ""Tears"" was sampled and used as the basis of the DJ Shadow song ""Organ Donor"" on his 1996 album Endtroducing......

&gt; On September 20, 2004 Moroder was honored at the Dance Music Hall of Fame ceremony, held in New York, when he was inducted for his many outstanding achievements and contributions as producer. In 2005, he was given the title of Commendatore by Azeglio Ciampi.

&gt; In 2005, a great deal of his work (including the Cizeta-Moroder supercar he co-produced in the mid 90s with Claudio Zampolli) was used in the video game Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, and was the entire playlist of the Flashback FM radio station.

&gt; Giorgio Moroder is one of the numerous composers interested in writing the theme tune of the 2008 Bejing Olympic Games. This is not the first theme song Moroder composed for the Olympic games. ""Hand in Hand"" was regarded as the best ever Olympic theme song for the 1988 Seoul Olympics by former International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Juan Antonio Samaranch.

&gt; Moroder contributed to Daft Punk's 2013 studio album Random Access Memories, admitting that he had been a fan of their song ""One More Time"" before working with the group. His voice and story is featured on the album's track ""Giorgio by Moroder"". On the track he states, ""My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio."" Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Pizzicato Five (often nicknamed ""P5"") is a legendary Japanese group that formed in 1984. Arguably the first group to popularize shibuya-kei from underground circles, they also later on began experimenting with the style, with what some called an innovative genre all their own, blending traditional Japanese pop, alternative, soul, funk, jazz, ye-ye, acoustic folk, and early electronic music, among others. They are also perhaps best known to audiences in the west in their later incarnation as a duo of Nomiya Maki (野宮真貴) and Konishi Yasuharu (小西康陽).

&gt; They are widely credited to have spearheaded the ""Shibuya-kei"" movement of Tokyo in the 90s, along with Flipper's Guitar. 

&gt; They are known for their eclectic and energetic compositions, which often sound like ""new"" releases from the late 1960s hipster scene. Their catchphrase--""A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular""--captured the group's ironic stance but eager attitude. The group broke up in March 2001.

&gt; A hugely prolific group, Pizzicato Five would release at least an album-per-year along with various EPs and remix albums during their 16 year-career.

&gt; Both Nomiya Maki (野宮真貴) and Konishi Yasuharu(小西康陽) currently enjoy solo careers - with Konishi Yasuharu(小西康陽) producing other artists ranging from Puffy and SMAP to Cornelius and kahimi karie(カヒミ・カリィ) - alongside collaborative remix compilations - from Ella Fitzgerald and The Supremes to classic Disney and Thunderbirds (as in Super-Marionated) music on his Shibuya-based Readymade Records label.  

&gt; On Thursday March 31st, 2011, exactly 10 years after Pizzicato Five disbanded, Konishi Yasuharu announced a new solo project called Pizzicato One.  The first release, titled One and Ten Very Sad Songs, consists of covers of English songs, each featuring vocals by various internationally-known artists from around the world.

&gt; Reverend Albert Green (born April 13 1946 in Forrest City, Arkansas) is an American Grammy award winning soul and gospel singer who enjoyed great popularity in the 70s with hit singles such as ""Let's Stay Together"", Tired of Being Alone"", and ""You Oughta Be With Me"". Green has boasted a voice capable of both fluid high streams of sugar and deep south growls and rasps. He has sold over 20 million records worldwide, and he was also inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, being referred to as ""one of the most gifted purveyors of soul music.""

&gt; Green was born in Forrest City, Arkansas.  He started performing at age ten in a Forrest City quartet called the Greene Brothers; he dropped the final ""E"" from his last name years later as a solo artist. They toured extensively in the mid-1950s in the South until the Greenes moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan, when they began to tour around Michigan. His father kicked him out of the group because he caught Green listening to Jackie Wilson.

&gt; In 1967 at the age of 16, Al formed an R&amp;B group, Al Green &amp; the Creations, with several of his high-school friends. Two Creation members, Curtis Rogers and Palmer James, founded their own independent record company, Hot Line Music Journal, and had the group record for the label. By that time, the Creations had been re-named the Soul Mates. The group's first single, ""Back Up Train,"" became a surprise hit, climbing to number five on the R&amp;B charts early in 1968. The Soul Mates attempted to record another hit, but all of their subsequent singles failed to find an audience. In 1969, Al Green met bandleader and Hi Records vice president Willie Mitchell while on tour in Midland, Texas. Impressed with Green's voice, he signed the singer to Hi Records, and began collaborating with Al on his debut album

&gt; He was perhaps the ideal complement to the orchestral, syrupy, strong soul production work of Hi Records wizard Willie Mitchell, who also helmed 70s classics for Syl Johnson, Ann Peebles, and himself.

&gt; On October 18, 1974, Mary Woodson, a woman who was his longtime girlfriend, threw a large pot of sticky boiling grits on him as he was preparing to shower, because he didn't want to get married. She committed suicide in minutes, which deeply affected Green to turn to God and religion. This assault from behind caused third-degree burns on his back, stomach and arm. Deeply shaken, Green continued to reaffirm and grow closer to his deeply held love for God, and became an ordained pastor of the Full Gospel Tabernacle in Memphis in 1976. 
Continuing to record R&amp;B, Green saw his sales start to slip and drew mixed reviews from critics. 1977's The Belle Album was critically acclaimed but did not regain his former mass audience. In 1979 Green injured himself falling off the stage while performing in Cincinnati and interpreted this as a message from God. He then concentrated his energies towards pastoring his church and gospel singing, also appearing in 1982 with Patti Labelle in the Broadway musical Your Arms Too Short to Box with God. According to Glide Magazine, ""by the late 70s, he had begun concentrating almost exclusively on gospel music."" His first gospel album was The Lord Will Make a Way. From 1981 to 1989 Green recorded a series of gospel recordings, garnering eight ""soul gospel performance"" Grammys in that period. In 1985, he reunited with Willie Mitchell along with Angelo Earl for He Is the Light, his first album for A&amp;M Records. In 1984, director Robert Mugge released a documentary film, Gospel According to Al Green, including interviews about his life and footage from his church. In 1989, Green released ""I Get Joy"", again with producer/guitarist Angelo Earl. In 2001, he appeared in the movie and soundtrack of On the Line featuring Lance Bass.

&gt; After spending several years exclusively performing gospel, Green began to return to Rhythm &amp; Blues. First, he released a duet with Annie Lennox, ""Put a Little Love in Your Heart"" for Scrooged, a 1988 Bill Murray film. In 1989 Green worked with producer Arthur Baker writing and producing the international hit ""The Message Is Love"". In 1991 he created the introductory theme song for the short-lived television series Good Sports featuring Ryan O'Neal and Farrah Fawcett. In 1992, Green recorded again with Baker, the Fine Young Cannibals, and reunited with his former Memphis mix engineer (this time functioning as producer) Terry Manning, to release the album Don't Look Back. His 1994 duet with country music singer Lyle Lovett blended country with R&amp;B, garnering him his ninth Grammy, this time in a pop music category. Green's first secular album in some time was Your Heart's In Good Hands (1995), released to positive reviews but disappointing sales, the same year Green was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
In 2000, Green published Take Me to the River, a book discussing his career. Green received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002.
In 2001, Green's live cover of Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" was released on the soundtrack to Will Smith's film Ali (the song plays when Muhammad Ali learns of the death of close friend Malcolm X).
By 2003 Green released a non-religious (secular) album entitled I Can't Stop, his first collaboration with Willie Mitchell since 1985's He is the Light. In March 2005 he issued Everything's OK as the follow-up to I Can't Stop. Green also collaborated with Mitchell on this secular CD.

&gt; The title of Al Green's latest album Lay It Down released May, 2008, truly tells it like it is. Conceived as a collaboration between the soul legend and a handful of gifted young admirers from the worlds of contemporary R&amp;B and hip hop, the album is drawn from a series of inspired sessions that yielded the most high-spirited, funky and often lushly romantic songs of Green's latter-day career.

&gt; The project features the sophisticated R&amp;B voices of singer-songwriters John Legend, Anthony Hamilton and Corinne Bailey Rae, and it was co-produced with Green by two of hip-hop's most innovative players, drummer Ahmir ""?uestlove"" Thompson from the Roots and keyboardist  James Poyser , the go-to guy for high-profile artists ranging from Erykah Badu to Common.

Like you said, that's probably even the majority of people who claim the genre as their own. 

It's just that only listening to the radio gives you a rough idea of what music is like, but it's never the full story of a certain genre.

&gt; The Police were a new wave band which formed in 1977 in London, England. The band consisted of Sting (vocals, bass), Andy Summers (guitar) and Stewart Copeland (drums).  The band released five albums -- ""Outlandos d'Amour"" (1978), ""Reggatta de Blanc"" (1979), ""Zenyatta Mondatta"" (1980), ""Ghost in the Machine"" (1982) and ""Synchronicity"" (1983) -- before entering a hiatus in 1984 and ultimately disbanding in 1986

&gt; The band reunited in January 2007 for a reunion tour that lasted until August 2008. 

&gt; Biography 

&gt; The Police formed in early 1977 in London by Stewart Copeland (drums), Gordon Sumner, better known as Sting (bass and lead vocals), and Henry Padovani (guitar). Andy Summers later joined the group, and after a very short stint as a quartet, Padovani left the band. The Police became one of the most popular bands in the late 70s and throughout the 80s.

&gt; The Police are notable as one of the first mainstream white pop groups to adopt reggae as a predominant musical form and to score major international hits with reggae-styled material. (The first all-white reggae band with permanent members and frequent recording in Europe was Peps Blodsband, lead by Peps Persson from south Sweden who changed from blues to reggae 1974/75). Although reggae was already very popular in the United Kingdom (due to the large number of Caribbean immigrants) and a number of Western European countries, reggae was little known in the United States and rejected by most black artists in U.S, and prior to the emergence of the Police only a handful of reggae songs had enjoyed any significant chart success. The Police, UB40, The Clash and Bob Marley (Jamaican, partly living in England after being shot in Jamaica, are considered with a number of new wave, rock and ska bands as one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the U.S.

&gt; The Police were strongly influenced by reggae (especially reggae drumming and base lines), jazz and, in the beginning, punk rock – something that came to be shifted more and more towards pop during the 80s. Their lyrics also changed from challenging, but yet somewhat politically restrained punk- and new wave lyrics, to after 1982 in some songs emphasize environmental awareness and human oneness. The biggest hits, however, had romantic or sexual themes. The Police met together with other ""white"" British bands which played reggae, as UB40,  criticism from black English rastafarian reggae bands like Aswad (in a BBC documentary on TV) and Steel Pulse, for being accomplices in the music industry of ""Babylon"", stealing the Caribbean slave descendants' musical treasure. This criticism has later been withdrawn. Aswad has even made the covers of Police songs like ""Roxanne"".

&gt; Tension grew between the band members, because unlike most other bands, they did not share songwriting credits. They released their last album, Synchronicity, in 1983, selling over 8 million copies. Synchronicity is critically regarded as their best album, with hits such as Synchronicity II, King of Pain, and probably their best known song, Every Breath You Take. In 1984, after touring in support of Synchronicity, The Police went on hiatus while Sting pursued his acting and solo music careers. Two years later, The Police reformed and played a few concerts for Amnesty International.  Soon after the band went into the studio. Sting wanted to re-record their old songs but Andy and Stewart wanted to leave the originals alone and only two songs were re-recorded during these studio sessions. Although the group is considered to have disbanded in 1984, 1986 was the last time The Police engaged in any musical activity. 

&gt; In 1992 the band released ""Message in a Box"", their 4 CD box set, and performed at Sting's wedding to Trudie Styler.  A live CD was released in June 1995. On March 10, 2003 The Police were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  and performed Message in a Bottle, Roxanne and Every Breath You Take.

&gt; The Police reformed in 2007 and opened the Grammy award ceremony of that year with a performance of Roxanne. Towards the end of May the band began a world tour.  In  2008  the tour ended at Madison Square Garden, New York on August 7, and The Police disbanded for good.  Sting was quoted towards the end of the tour that he had achieved closure with the band and revealed that The Police would never tour or record again. 

&gt; Sting has said that the material on the album Ghost in the Machine were inspired by the writings of Arthur Koestler, and that the Police's final studio album Synchronicity was influenced by the writings of Carl Jung. Sting also peppers his songs with literary allusions: the song ""Don't Stand So Close to Me"" mentions Vladimir Nabokov's  novel Lolita; ""Tea in the Sahara"" alludes to the novel The Sheltering Sky by Paul Bowles; and ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" refers both to the sea monsters Scylla and Charybdis, from Greek mythology, and to Mephistopheles, from the German legend of Faust .

&gt; Glassjaw is a highly influential post-hardcore band from Long Island, NY.  They formed in the summer of 1993 after Palumbo and Beck met each other at camp.  They recorded some demos before releasing the EP ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" in 1997, and recorded their first full length album ""Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence"" in 2000 on Roadrunner Records.  The record brought the band out of Long Island and into the hands of a dedicated grass-roots following. The band has been influential in the progression of the underground music scene in the eastern United States and United Kingdom and on the post-hardcore genre, and are known for their intense live shows and constant line-up changes.

&gt; Their sophomore album ""Worship and Tribute"" was released in 2002 on Warner Brothers Records.   Although it received some MTV airtime, a Grammy nomination and a peak at #82 on the Billboard top 200, ""Worship and Tribute"" was a departure from the debut and was met with mixed reviews from fans.  Since then, Glassjaw have not recorded any new material, releasing the digital-only EP ""El Mark"" in 2005, a release that consisted of three unused songs from the ""Worship and Tribute"" sessions.

&gt; In 2005, all members spare Palumbo and Beck left the band for reasons which remain unclear.  It is supposed that they left involuntarily.  Ex-drummer Durijah Lang and ex-bass player Manuel Ragoonanan Carrero were soon inducted back into the band, so there was once again a functional lineup for playing shows.  Indeed, the new four-piece Glassjaw played a handful of shows in Summer 2005.  A new album was apparently in the works for a release in 2007, but never surfaced.

&gt; Daryl Palumbo also fronts electronic pop-rock band Head Automatica, and ex-Glassjaw drummer Larry Gorman also played for them; however, Gorman is no longer a member of the band for unknown reasons.

&gt; Ex-guitarist Todd Weinstock now plays in the similarly-styled band Men, Women, &amp; Children.

&gt; After a two-year hiatus, the band played three shows in 2005, two at the now-defunct The Downtown in Farmingdale, NY, with proceeds going to charity, and a spot on The Used's tour at the Hammerstein Ballroom.

&gt; After some mysterious updates on their website, the 2007 Glassjaw tour had gone and ended, already hitting up spots including yet another venue in Farmingdale, NY, playing 2 shows in one day at The Crazy Donkey.

&gt; Glassjaw's next album is highly anticipated, not only due to their last full-length release dating back to 2002, but also the delay and lack of information regarding its status and/or release. In an interview with Palumbo in the July, 2006 issue of AP magazine, he stated that the band were in the process of writing and recording new material for the next album, which they hoped to release in 2007. Palumbo hinted that there could be a unifying concept behind the album. In November, 2007, in the first Glassjaw interview in years, Beck revealed they had written ""about eleven good songs -- seven i love, and four to six half-baked ideas we need to finish"".

&gt; In an interview with Kerrang!, Palumbo stated that the new album should be released by ""The end of this year or early 2009...I hope."" Details emerged from The Grixer in May, 2008 that the album was ""awaiting vocals"" and ""should be wrapped up and completed in the coming months"". In a May, 2008 interview with Verse One magazine, Beck said: ""Right now I’d just be happy to finish up this record. I’m sure if it’s not a giant pile of shit, we’d love to play it live. Exact dates, plans, don’t know yet."" In a June, 2008 interview conducted by Glassjaw.net, Beck stated, ""As far as I am personally concerned, there will be a release well before the end of the year.""

&gt; On August 6–8, 2010, the band released a 7"" vinyl single for ""All Good Junkies Go to Heaven"" spraypainted green and pink on either side of the vinyl at the UK's Hevy Fest. This is the first official Glassjaw release since 2005's El Mark EP[/album. On August 8, 2010 via MerchDirect, ""All Good Junkies Go To Heaven"" became available for purchase. Within hours of availability, the vinyl had sold out. Shortly thereafter, in addition to the launch of the single, a ""one-take"" live video of their 2008 song ""You Think You're (John Fucking Lennon)"" was posted on the official Glassjaw website. On September 8, Glassjaw announced the release of another vinyl single for release on September 9, 2010 for the song ""Jesus Glue"", as well as a digital download for ""All Good Junkies Go To Heaven"" in various formats. On September 23, GlassJaw posted a video for the song, ""Stars"", a reworked version of ""Star Above my Bed"", a fan favorite. As they did with ""Junkies"" and ""Jesus Glue,"" October 10 saw the release of yet another vinyl, ""Natural Born Farmer"" and the digital release of ""Jesus Glue.""

&gt; At 11:11AM on January 11, glassjaw.com began streaming a studio recording of ""Gold"". The website's background was changed to a live band photo with the text ""coloring book, the extended play. available exclusively at venue. gratis."" After the first concert on their 2011 tour, February 13, 2011, the new EP Coloring Book was given away free to each fan that attended the concert. Glassjaw played two shows in the UK, at the London HMV Forum (March 30) and the Cardiff Solus (March 31), with support from Napalm Death and also headlined Soundfest (June 10), playing alongside other artists such as Brother Ali, Del the Funky Homosapien and If He Dies He Dies. The band also played the Radio 1 / NME Stage at Reading and Leeds Festival in August 2011.

&gt; Glassjaw played their first and only scheduled show so far in 2012 in support of Rise Against's Endgame tour. It was the only show Glassjaw opened for them on the tour. A Day To Remember, The Menzingers, Architects, Touché Amoré, and Title Fight are also supporting selected dates. Glassjaw have been added to the Sonisphere festival line-up and will perform Worship &amp; Tribute in its entirety during their set. However, it was announced on March 29, 2012 via Sonishere's website that the festival was canceled due to issues in setting up the festival. As a result, the band have scheduled a date at New York's Irving Plaza to play the album in its entirety. The band have also been announced to be playing Hevy Festival 2012, alongside acts such as Converge, Rolo Tomassi and Will Haven. This will mark Glassjaw's second time playing at the festival, and the first since headlining it in 2010. Read more on Last.fm.

6220," Beyonce is a performance artist and singer. She has never alluded to otherwise. It takes talent and hard work to sing, dance, and perform the way she does - other wise a lot more people would do it and she wouldn't be paid millions to do so. 

Those people who credit Beyonce for the whole song are making assumptions by their own volition. The people who write and produce the songs for Beyonce know full well they don't get the full prestige of credit but they get credit in other ways such as money contracts to produce for other performers.

 If nobody performed their work then they wouldn't get paid so they sell it to people who *can* perform the songs. It's a symbiotic relationship. Who would go see a writer go up on stage and read their work even if they don't have the talent of singing? Many producers also D.J so they *can* receive credit for their work that way as well. With the rise of techno/electronica/dubstep etc. this has been a popular way for producers to get famous.

But by and large, people prefer singing and performing to the technical aspects of the production. This applies to everything that has ""face."" Someone designed the McDonald's Arches but you never hear about them? Why don't they get credit for their artwork?

Furthermore, I don't see why you would divorce singing from the concept of art by way of necessitating that everyone who sings *must* also write their songs in order to be considered an artist. 

Led Zeppelin, Elvis, and a lot of other rock 'n' roll musicians blatantly stole their music from blues musicians yet these blues musicians hardly get credited which is admittedly unfair. 

What I'm saying is that people don't care who wrote a dance hit. They just want to dance and sing along which is fine. Writers and producers who otherwise aren't inclined to perform get to be paid for their music and see it performed. Both the performers of the music as well as the designers of it are artists just in different ways that support each other.

&gt; Korn (stylized as KoЯn) is an American nu metal band from Bakersfield, California, formed in 1992. The current band line up includes five members: Jonathan Davis, James Shaffer, Reginald Arvizu, Brian Welch and Ray Luzier. The band was formed as an expansion of L.A.P.D. They have collaborated with musicians such as Chino Moreno from Deftones, Fred Durst from nu metal band Limp Bizkit, Ice Cube, Tre Hardson from The Pharcyde, Skrillex and Nas.

&gt; The band released their first demo album, Neidermeyer's Mind, in 1993. Their debut album, Korn was released in 1994, where they featured the same musicians that had performed on Neidermeyer's Mind. The band began recording Life Is Peachy in April 1996, and released it on October 15, 1996. Follow the Leader is recognized as Korn's mainstream breakthrough, peaking at number one on the Billboard 200 in 1998, along with the following album, Issues in 1999. The band released Untouchables on June 11, 2002, and later released Take a Look in the Mirror on November 21, 2003, both peaking in the top ten of the Billboard 200. Their first compilation album, Greatest Hits Vol 1, peaked at number four on the Billboard 200. See You on the Other Side was released on December 6, 2005, and Korn's untitled album was released nearly two years later on July 31, 2007. Korn III: Remember Who You Are, the band's ninth studio album, was released July 13, 2010 via Roadrunner Records. In 2011, they released an album called The Path of Totality and with the album, they added sounds and instruments of dubstep with their nu metal sound.

&gt; The Get Up! Songfacts reports that Korn's 10th studio album, The Path Of Totality was produced by various dubstep, drum and bass, and electro house artists due to the band's desire to fuse their traditional sound with electronic elements. released on December 2, 2011 in Europe and December 6, 2011 in the US. Davis explained the album title: ""The title The Path of Totality refers to the fact that in order to see the sun in a full solar eclipse, you must be in the exact right place in the exact right time. That's how this album came together. I think all the producers feel the same way. I'm not sure it could ever happen again.""

&gt; Korn currently has over 36 singles, over 25 of which have charted. The band has over 5 video albums and over 34 music videos.

&gt; Korn has sold over 19 million albums in the US, and over 40 million worldwide. Ten of the band's official releases have peaked in the top ten of the Billboard 200, eight of which have peaked in the top five. Eight of those releases are certified Platinum by the RIAA, and one is certified Gold. Korn have also earned seven Grammy nominations — two of which they have won (for ""Freak on a Leash"" and ""Here to Stay"").

&gt; Korn say they will release a new album soon in 2013, saying it will be aggressive, heavy and having ""in your face!"" vocals and to sound like their roots. Brain Welch also says he will perform at some concerts with them in January 2013. He also says he will later on rejoin the band. But he left the band originally to rededicate his life back to Christianity. While David, left and opened a bar in Bakersfield, California.

&gt; They were the first band to be labeled as nu metal, people say they were starting the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. Alongside this genre, the band has also been labeled as heavy metal, rap metal, funk metal, groove metal, rap rock, alternative metal and industrial metal. Their debut album mixed metal with grunge and hip-hop. Their lyrics focus mostly on stuff like personal alienation, pain, social anger, issues, memories, personal views and thoughts and sometimes revenge. In Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock &amp; Punk, Korn was marked as the third biggest nu metal band in the world. The band, especially their frontman Jonathan have rejected the metal label. Although Munky said he never considered the band as nu metal. In their Issues album, they reduced slightly the rap sounds they had, but returned to it with Take a Look in the Mirror going back to their roots and being very aggressive, but with See You On the Other Side, they took influences from industrial metal but went back to the sound of Untouchables and Issues with their Untitled album. These are examples of their musical style and direction.

&gt; Thomas Earl Petty (born 20 October 1950 in Gainesville, Florida) is an American musician, singer, composer and songwriter. 
After working with his early bands The Sundowners, The Epics, and Mudcrutch (which also included future Heartbreakers members Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench) he began his recording career with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers when the band broke onto the national music scene with their 1976 self-titled debut album. Still, it took America a full year to catch up to the album. ""Breakdown"" was re-released to radio and became a Top 40 hit in 1977 after word filtered back the band was creating a firestorm in England. 
He was also a member of The Traveling Wilburys, along with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Bob Dylan and Roy Orbison. Petty and the Heartbreakers also toured as a backing band for Bob Dylan.

&gt; Petty is a vocal critic of the modern recording industry, including the disintegration of independent radio stations.

&gt; Petty has been supported by his band, The Heartbreakers, for the majority of his career. He has occasionally released solo work, as is the case with his 2006 effort, Highway Companion, on which he performed most of the backing instrumentation himself. Examples of other solo albums include Full Moon Fever and Wildflowers

&gt; His latest release is a reunion of Mudcrutch. Read more on Last.fm.

Luniz lyrics take novel, comic approaches to sex, drugs, and everyday occurrences.They have released 3 albums ""Operation Stackola"",""Lunitik Muzik"" and ""Silver &amp; Black"".

&gt; Peter and Kerry began as an impulsive side-project. The two solo artists, who had become close friends following a years' worth of label-related activities, decided to make use of some spare time one weekend in the late-Summer. Having never fully-collaborated, the duo bravely embarked upon an uninterrupted writing and recording session which took place over several days at Peter's family home in Southampton.

&gt; They returned to London with a finished record. The release, entitled 'Clothes, Friends, Photos EP', has since gathered critical acclaim from blogs, magazines and radio stations worldwide; what began as a whimsical experiment has become an exciting new outlet. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; 2 Live Crew (also known as ""The 2 Live Crew"") is a controversial miami bass group, largely known due to the sexual themes of one hip-hop album: 1989's 'As Nasty As They Wanna Be'. It was both certified double platinum by the RIAA as well as subject to an acrimonious legal case. 2 Live Crew formed as three young men in the U.S. Air Force all met each other after they became stationed in Riverside, California in 1984.

&gt; Made up of Fresh Kid Ice (born Chris Wong Won), DJ Mr. Mixx (born David Hobbs), and Amazing V (born Yuri Vielot), the multi-racial rap group released their debut single, ""Revelation"". in 1985. Published through Fresh Beat Records/Macola Records out of Hollywood, California, their track showed the fingerprints of early 80s electronica music. Inspired by records by hip-hop pioneers such as Afrika Bambaataa, they put the group together with the intentions of ""sustaining the 808 kick drum"".

&gt; ""Revelation"" achieved major success in Miami, Florida, where performer Luke Skyywalker (born Luther Campbell) and the Ghetto Style DJ's took interest in 2 Live Crew. The group traveled to Miami to perform at Luke's ""Pac Jam"" teen club, also landing live mix show slots on Steven J Grey's WEDR radio show. In 1985, the group released a new single, called ""What I Like"", on Fresh Beat/Macola.

&gt; Amazing V left the group, and Fresh Kid Ice along with Mr. Mixx moved to Miami, hiring Luke Skyywalker as their manager. In 1986, the act was hired to perform WEDR's Dade County Youth Fair, adding fellow California rapper Brother Marquis, formerly of The Caution Crew, and recorded the opening song to their album live. After realizing their shows lacked stage presence, they decided to add Luke to the group as a stage hypeman. Reacting to the crowd's dirty dancing they saw in Miami, they responded by recording suggestive music, which soon evolved into fully fledged x-rated music.

&gt; Once major labels came to Luke in hopes of recruiting the group away from Luke Skyywalker Records, Luke finally clamped down and had 2 Live Crew sign contracts. Having their own label also meant keeping their tracks free from record company censorship, and 2 Live Crew's raunchy 1986 song ""Throw the D"" managed to sell over 200,000 copies. Luke joined the group completely as a co-vocalist as well.

&gt; On the heels of ""As Nasty as they Wanna Be"", Luke decided to record an album in his own name with the massive aid of 2 Live Crew. When the crew recived a small flat fee for their work on Luke's album rather than receiving royalties, the group secretly broke up over money. Mr. Mixx moved to Oakland forming T-Shirt &amp; Khakis Productions, and Brother Marquis moved to Atlanta forming the group 2 Nazty; however, Luke convinced them to record one more album. During the recording process, sample clearances became an issue, making the record less than their expectations. The crew remained broken up, suing Luke for back royalties. Fresh Kid Ice backed out of the suit, remained with Luke Records, and reformed as ""The New 2 Live Crew"" for one album.

&gt; Finally, he too left Luke and the three core members regrouped signing with Luke's former business associate Lil Joe Weinstein, but the album was not marketed well. The filmakers behind the film ""Friday"" contacted Luke for a new 2 Live Crew song for the soundtrack not knowing the group had broken up. Luke convinced them to regroup under Luke's tutelage again for one song, but that was the last time all four members would work together. Since then, various members have recorded and toured as 2 Live Crew, licensing the name from Lil Joe Weinstein Read more on Last.fm.

9707,"I don't think the two are mutually exclusive. Regardless of the reason that HttK became an homage to their influences, that is still what it is. Whether it's good or not is entirely subjective.

Point being, whether it was a result of clashing creative ideas (which I would find weird that Arin would try to assert his vision in an established, huge band rather than just go with it, especially for his first album with them, and given that they wrote Not Ready to Die with him as well, and it's fantastic) or it's genuinely the album they wanted to write at the time, it is still an homage to their influences.

&gt; Spiritualized are an English rock band formed in 1990 in Rugby, Warwickshire, United Kingdom by Jason Pierce, who often goes by the alias J. Spaceman, after the spectacular demise of the Spacemen 3 outfit. The membership of Spiritualized changes from album to album, with Pierce being the only constant factor.

&gt; The first Spiritualized release was a space rock-esque cover of Any Way That You Want Me in 1990, a record which heralded the official split of Spacemen 3 following contractual wrangles over the band's name. Of the final Spacemen 3 line up, bassist Will Carruthers, drummer Jonny Mattock and session guitarist Mark Refoy joined Pierce in the first phase of Spiritualized (for the debut LP, Lazer Guided Melodies), alongside his then girlfriend Kate Radley. None of the original line up remains - Carruthers tried for a solo career, Mattock played for a spell in The Breeders (and later Lupine Howl), Refoy formed Slipstream(his replacement was John Coxon) and Radley married Richard Ashcroft of The Verve. A later cohort of Spiritualized backing musicians - Sean Cook, Damon Reece and Michael Mooney - formed Lupine Howl following summary dismissal by Pierce.

&gt; Sax player Ray 'Moonshake' Dickaty was added to the lineup in 1997, and Gregg Hale (guitar) also augmented the band in 1997 and 1998.

&gt; Retaining only keyboardist Thighpaulsandra (keyboards)a replacement for Kate Radley, Jason Pierce then debuted a new (and current) line up of Spiritualized, introducing classical percussionist Tom Edwards and former Julian Cope string arranger Martin Schellard on bass guitar. Completing the new Spiritualized line-up were guitarist Doggen of Brain Donor and the Julian Cope band, and drummer Kevin 'Kevlar' Bales who is also ex-Julian Cope band. Ray Dickaty departed in 2003, quitting to play in the free-jazz Solar Fire Trio. The remaining line-up finished recording the album Songs In A&amp;E in Nottingham and London.

&gt; The musical style of Spiritualized can perhaps be best described as psychedelic rock, especially earlier albums like Lazer Guided Melodies and Pure Phase, which also incorporated elements of the shoegazing style made popular by influential 1991 album Loveless. The landmark Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space showed influences from African-American gospel and blues beginning to creep in, and wall of sound influences from Phil Spector and Brian Wilson began to predominate, which came to a head on Let It Come Down. Amazing Grace favoured a more stripped down sound with the gospel, blues, and soul influences heavier than ever.

&gt; For several years (ending in or about 1999), Spiritualized were the only active artist signed to Dedicated Records, a British independent label which had, by then, been acquired by Spiritualized's then-label, Arista Records.

&gt; On 15 June 1997, Spiritualized became the last band to play at Factory Records' Manchester nightclub The Haçienda.

&gt; After several years of work and Pierce's serious illness in July 2005,the album, Songs in A&amp;E was released on 26 May 2008 in the UK, and on 27 May 2008 in the US. The first single from the 18-track album was ""Soul On Fire"". The release was backed by an Electric Mainlines UK tour which began in May. Pierce has also scored Harmony Korine's 2008 film Mister Lonely.

&gt; In October and December 2009 the band performed 1997's Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series.

&gt; After more than two years in the making, while Pierce was undergoing experimental chemotherapy for a liver disease, and including a year long period of mixing, Sweet Heart Sweet Light was released in April 2012, on Double Six Records. The band had already played some of this new material over the past 3 years but not much else was known about the content of the album. The album cover, an octagon surrounding the word ""Huh?"" on a plain white background, is a reference to the working title of the album. In an interview regarding the new release it was revealed that the album would ""embrace"" more poppy songs compared to previous albums. In the same interview, Jason Pierce also said that the album was partly inspired by the experiences of performing Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space live in its entirety.

I havent been to the whole republic, but Ive gone to a few states and they are nothing like Cancun, that city was litterally built for tourism, I cant recall any other Mexican city that was built with that in mind.Anyways, what do I gain from impersonating a Mexican? Nothing, just because I fucked up doesn't mean I am not Mexican. Its like if I can name more cities in the US doest that make me know more about the US than you? No cuz I havent lived there. Anyways if you have been to Mexico then you will know that none of the resort towns you listed are representative of Mexico.

In my originial post I miss typed, it should be its nothing like, not nothing else, because truly Cancun is nothing like the rest of Mexico, sure theres like 4 other places that are alike, but that isnt even 1% of Mexico.

What I am trying to say is that if you go to Cancun you're kind of not really getting to see Mexico, you're seeing what Mexico wants you to think about Mexico. Ive friends from England who went to Cancun and asked me if all of Mexico is like that and no, it isnt as beautiful, or expensive, I mean all you have to do to realise is drive a couple of kilometers into Mexico and you will see where all the workers in Cancun live, that city is a lot more representative, thats all I was trying to say, obviously Cancun is part of Mexico but its nothing like the average town.",Music

&gt; Spoon is an American indie rock band from Austin, Texas. The band was formed in late 1993 by lead singer/guitarist Britt Daniel and drummer Jim Eno. Current members also include: Eric Harvey (keyboard, guitar, percussion, backing vocals) and Rob Pope (bass, backing vocals - replaced Joshua Zarbo in 2007).

&gt; After releasing their debut LP Telephono on Matador Records, the band signed with Elektra in 1998, but the contract was dropped soon after the band released A Series of Sneaks. In response the band released a two-song single titled The Agony of Laffitte (referring to Elektra A&amp;R man Ron Laffitte). Eventually they signed to Merge Records.

&gt; Spoon has been met with widespread critical acclaim. Girls Can Tell, released in 2001, sold more copies than both their previous releases combined. Kill the Moonlight accomplished the same feat a year later. Gimme Fiction was released on May 10, 2005 and continued the trend of increasing popularity for the band.

&gt; Britt Daniel wrote much of the soundtrack to the 2006 film Stranger Than Fiction. Four tracks by Spoon are also featured.

&gt; The band released their sixth studio album Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga on July 10, 2007; those who purchased the first pressing also received a bonus disc titled Get Nice!.

&gt; Transference is their seventh studio album. It was released on January 18, 2010 in Europe, and on January 19 in North America, to moderately positive reviews.

&gt; Whitney Houston (born on August 9, 1963 in Newark, New Jersey, death announced February 11, 2012 in Los Angeles, California) was a Grammy and Emmy Award winning American R&amp;B/pop singer, actress, former fashion model, record and movie producer. Whitney Houston is one of pop music's best-selling music artists of all-time, with more than 200 million combined albums, singles, and videos sold worldwide. She was known for her soulful dramatic mezzo-soprano voice, vocal power, range and melismatic skill.  She was labeled the ""Queen of Songs"" by Arsenio Hall, who described her as ""the first lady of song"". She was also known to millions as ""The Voice"", a nickname given to her by Oprah Winfrey. Also known as the ""Queen of Pop/Soul"", or soulful-pop music. 

&gt; Whitney's debut album was released in 1985 to critical and commercial international success, and she went on to release seven consecutive number-one hits on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. She was one of a handful of African-American artists who received heavy-rotation on MTV during the network's early years in the 1980s.

&gt; Houston continued her success into the 1990s with the release of several films and their corresponding soundtrack albums, the most popular of which was The Bodyguard (1992), which produced the worldwide number-one hit single I Will Always Love You. According to the  I Will Always Love You Songfacts, it stayed at US #1 for 14 weeks, which was a record at the time and for a while was second to ""We Are The World"" as the biggest-selling single ever. Houston's albums in the 2000s have been less successful.

&gt; Her personal life became the subject of controversy because of allegations of drug abuse, especially after repeated cancellations of public appearances and erratic behaviour. 

&gt; In mid 2009, Houston released her seventh and final studio album, ""I Look To You."" The album debut at #1 on the Billboard 200. It became another Platinum seller. It was state in the UK Newspaper ""The Mirror"" that Houston is thinking about recording her eighth studio album.

&gt; Her death was announced by her publicist on February 11, 2012. Read more on Last.fm.

I'm not too sure its ""changed their lives"" by some drastic margin, like saved them from depression or made them into a super-human being. To me, I don't think there's a record in particular thats changed my outlook on life, but maybe it has indirectly. When people say an album ""changed their life"" it's usually because they've put a value on what the album means to them, and have seen the effects over time.

In my case, Is This It by the Strokes I discovered wandering around YouTube. For me, it was my introduction and initiation into guitar-driven music. I heard something that was amazingly good, catchy, and just GOOD. Good music, through and through. Musicianship, artistry... it was everything most pop music is NOT. And it kind of started this thirst to find more artists, albums, genres, of the sort.

Is This It by the Strokes paved the way for me to get really into GOOD music. It showed me that there's amazing stuff that goes, arguably, under the radar. Not only that, but there's amazing music that wants to STAY for the most part under the radar. It's the reason why I like most of the bands I like, the reason why I learned and delved more into music and genres and history, and the reason why I care. It turned me into a goddamn hipster.

Hopefully that will go some distance to help show you how music changes your life. Did it change how I think? About music, yes. About life? In some ways, I suppose. Did it change my life? Well, as music is a big part of it I'd say yeah.

I'd say hell yeah.

&gt; John Miles (born John Errington, 23 April 1949, Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, England) is an English rock music vocalist, songwriter, guitarist and keyboard player, best known for his 1976 Top 3 UK hit single, Music

&gt; He was a member of groups ""The Influence"", which also included Paul Thompson, later drummer with Roxy Music and Vic Malcolm, later vocalist with Geordie and ""The John Miles Set,"" before starting his solo career in 1971. During the 1970s he issued 18 singles and four albums, including ""Rebel"" (1976), ""Stranger In The City"" (1977), and ""Zaragon"" (1978). He had most success with singles; in addition to Music, he also charted with ""Highfly"" (1975), ""Remember Yesterday"" (1976), and ""Slow Down"" (1977). Most of his songs were co-written with his bassist Bob Marshall.

&gt; Miles has toured with Tina Turner, often filling in for Bryan Adams when the latter was unavailable to join her on tour for their duet. Miles is also a frequent guest vocalist on albums by The Alan Parsons Project.

&gt; In the 1980s he continued to record and tour. In 1983 a new radio station in the south of England, Radio Mercury, used parts from the song ""Music"" for their link jingles. The actual song itself also received extensive airplay on the station, leading one to speculate this was perhaps part of a deal for the usage in their jingles.

&gt; A list of Miles album releases from the 1980s and 1990s is as follows:
Sympathy (1980) 
Miles High (1981) 
John Miles' Music (1982) 
Play On (1983) 
Transition (1985) 
John Miles Live In Concert (1992) 
Anthology (1993) 
Upfront (1993) 
Master Series (1998) 
Tom and Catherine (1999) 
Millennium Edition (1999)

&gt; Throughout the late 80s and into the 90s John Miles was musical director to Tina Turner on her various tours, and played on several of her albums. He also played Hammond organ on Joe Cocker's album ""Night Calls""(1992). Today he is still making music, which he famously refers to as his ""first love"".

&gt; In 2002 he issued the DVD ""John Miles - Live In Concert."" Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Ariel Pink (born Ariel Marcus Rosenberg on June 24, 1978) is a musician who is based in Los Angeles. Pink has been recording his music on tape since 1996 but it wasn't until after he passed a CD-R to the New York-based band Animal Collective that his commercial musical career took off. He attended Beverly Hills High School in Beverly Hills, California. Later attending the School of Art at the California Institute of the Arts. 

&gt; Married to Alisa Daniels, July 2002 - they divorced in 2005. He lived with Geneva Jacuzzi for seven years until early 2011.

&gt; He has since caught the attention of various media sources, especially in the Los Angeles area. As most of his albums are self-made, many of them have never been heard by fans. The only albums which have been commercially released come from his ""Haunted Graffiti"" series and are thus the best known.

&gt; Pink produces and plays almost all of his own music, and is noted for creating drum sounds using primarily his mouth, and sometimes his armpits. His home recording technique gives his music a very lo-fi sound, to the point where new listeners may mistake the era of his music.

&gt; Pink cites R. Stevie Moore--friend, mentor, and ""father of home recording""--as one of his major influences. He is sometimes associated with the New Weird America movement, and could also be considered an embodiment of 'The New Sincerity'. Pink boasts a cult following and endorsements from more widely known artists such as fellow Paw Tracks artists Animal Collective.

&gt; Aside from his music, Pink also makes semi-abstract and surreal grotesque drawings, which can be purchased from his unofficial website, ARIEL PINK haunted house, for a hefty price. Read more on Last.fm.

I dont mean to group all rappers and pop musicians into one category, but a large percentage of these artists dont care about the music, they just do it for the money. Heck, a large percent of the mainstream pop music you hear wasnt even written by the artist it's released under. They buy music off of other songwriters and act as a channel of distribution.

&gt; Vampire Weekend is an indie rock band which formed in February 2006 in New York City, New York, United States. The band consists of Ezra Koenig (vocals, guitar), Chris Baio (bass) and Christopher Tomson (drums). Rostam Batmanglij has left the band in early 2016 to begin solo career, but will continue to collaborate with Ezra. The band has released three albums: ""Vampire Weekend"" (2008), ""Contra"" (2010)"", and ""Modern Vampires of the City"" (2013). The band has gained positive comparisons to such artists as Paul Simon, Haircut 100 and The Walkmen.

&gt; Vampire Weekend received much buzz from local blogs throughout 2007 during their rise to a record deal with indie label XL Recordings. Rolling Stone placed Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa at number 57 for the top 100 songs of 2007.

&gt; The band's debut album, ""Vampire Weekend"" was released on January 28. 2008. It was a surprise success, peaking at #17 on the Billboard 200. 

&gt; Their second album ""Contra"" was released on January 12, 2010. It contains the single ""Cousins"". The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200, only the 12th independently released and distributed album to achieve such a feat.

&gt; They are self-proclaimed ""specialists in the following styles: 'Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa', 'Upper West Side Soweto', 'Campus', and 'Oxford Comma Riddim.'""

&gt; The name ""Vampire Weekend"" comes from a movie that Ezra Koenig made in the summer of his freshman year at college.  You can watch the trailer on Youtube, here.

&gt; Burzum is the black metal solo project of Varg Vikernes (born Kristian Larsson Vikernes, AKA Greven Grishnackh/Count Grishnackh, currently legally named Louis Cachet). Burzum played a vital role, along with other Norwegian black metal bands such as Mayhem, Darkthrone, Emperor and Immortal, in the development of black metal as a musical genre and ideology. In particular, the ambient black metal and depressive black metal subgenres owe much to Burzum's sound.

&gt; From his 1992 debut, Burzum, until his (for the time being) final black metal album, 1996's Filosofem, Burzum went from playing raw, primitive black metal to playing ambient, exclusively synthesizer-based music. His two albums, 1997's Dauði Baldrs and 1999's Hliðskjálf, are purely dark ambient works recorded whilst in prison. However, they do not represent a complete departure from Burzum's previous works, as his albums always contained keyboard elements, and there were keyboard-only pieces on every album except Aske. Throughout his career, Varg has managed to create and maintain a very distinct sound unique to Burzum.

&gt; Despite Norwegian black metal scene being associated with anti-Christianity and anti-religion in general, Burzum's lyrics have been dealing largely with Tolkien world and general mysticism. Varg has totally distanced himself from the satanism usually associated with black metal.

&gt; Due to his imprisonment for several church arsons and the murder of Euronymous of Mayhem, Vikernes has become one of the most notorious figures within the Norwegian black metal scene. Vikernes maintains that he killed Euronymous in an act of self-defense, and denies participation in the burning of three Norwegian stave churches.

&gt; To read what Varg has to say about the origins of Burzum, '92/'93, and his own ideology as well as other matters concerning Burzum and Varg Vikernes, read his series of articles (A Burzum Story) at http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/, provided at the current official Burzum and Varg Vikernes website.

&gt; After 2012's Umskiptar, Varg said he is done with metal and now only produces ambient music albums under Burzum name. Read more on Last.fm.

In 1970 her heroin addiction really started to show and it was destroying her. It was devastating and very heartbreaking to watch her. I remember her last interviews on the Dick Cavett show and you could see it in her face and how she talked that she had a serious heroin problem. She was taken too soon. I will forever love Janis and her music and she has a special place in my heart. She was a real person with real feelings and a wonderful outgoing personality to match. Beautiful person and she was very down to earth and humble. She loved to connect with her fans and she didn't have an arrogant bone in her body. She didn't wear an ounce of makeup on stage and didn't feel obligated to conform and take criticism. Wonderful person.

&gt; Scars on Broadway is an alternative metal/experimental rock band which formed in 2003 in Los Angeles, California, United States. The band consists of Daron Malakian (vocals, guitar), Jules Pampena (drums), Dominic Cifarelli (bass), and Danny Shamoun (keyboards). Malakian is member of the alternative metal group System of a Down.

&gt; The first song released for the public to listen to was 'They Say' on the 28th March 2008 via the band's website, http://scarsonbroadway.com, and MySpace.

&gt; On December of 2005, Malakian said in an interview that he ""could release ten solo records tomorrow."". He also said, "" I have tons of material laying around. After these albums,"" (Mezmerize and Hypnotize) ""I'm gonna go off to learn how to brain and do something on my own, just like Serj. And no, System of a Down is not breaking up. We're just gonna do like KISS and put out our own solo records.""

&gt; ""Ghetto Blaster Rehearsals"" (2003) was supposedly a leak of new Scars on Broadway material, but in a 2007 letter, Daron announced on his website that these tracks weren't in any way affiliated with the current Scars on Broadway and that the music is from an unnamed disbanded project from four years ago (featuring Casey Chaos on vocals). 

&gt; The band's website featured a countdown timer, counting down to 15:00 PST of March 28, 2008. Additionally, above the timer, in quotation marks was the phrase ""They say it's all about to end."" When the countdown ended, the song ""They Say"" was made available on the site. The song is also available for listening on the band's official MySpace page, it is no longer available for free download.

&gt; Scars on Broadway played their first live show April 11, 2008 at the Whisky a Go-Go in Los Angeles, CA. They have also confirmed to be playing with Metallica at KFMA Day 2008 in Tucson, AZ. On January 22, 2008 Scars on Broadway were announced to be performing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 26, 2008. On May 17th of that year, the band also performed at the sixteenth annual KROQ Weenie Roast, along with Atreyu, Bad Religion, Flobots, Flogging Molly, Metallica, The Offspring, Pennywise, The Raconteurs, Rise Against and Seether.

&gt; On May 2, 2008, Scars announced on their official website that their debut album, Scars on Broadway, was to be released on the 28th and 29th of July.

&gt; In late 2008, the band entered a hiatus, with Malakian citing a lack of enthusiasm and ""his heart not being into touring"", as the primary reasons for the band's cessation. In April 2010, the band ended its hiatus, announcing a gig which will take place at The Troubador, Los Angeles on May 2, 2010.

&gt; On January 11, 2012 it was announced that they are currently recording their sophomore album and it is expected to be released sometime in the Fall. 
On September 12, 2012 It was revealed that an EP will also come out, sometime around the release of their second album. 
On September 22, 2012 Scars on Broadway performed at the Epicenter Festival in Irvine, Ca. 

&gt; They are now touring with Deftones. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; The Mountain Goats is the musical project of singer-songwriter, novelist, pianist and guitarist John Darnielle. He has the distinction of being named by the The New Yorker magazine as 'America’s best non-hip-hop lyricist'; in its June 2006 issue, Paste magazine dubbed Darnielle one of the '100 Best Living Songwriters'. Darnielle’s lyrics are erudite and compassionate and filled with imagery that reference classical literature, religion, mythology, culture, art, and history. Darnielle has stated that all songs written up to and including those on Tallahassee are fictional, but that We Shall All Be Healed, The Sunset Tree, and other more recent work are partially autobiographical.

&gt; Darnielle began performing under the name the Mountain Goats in 1991 in Claremont, California, where he attended Pitzer College and worked as a psychiatric nurse. The band's name, the Mountain Goats, is a reference to the Screamin' Jay Hawkins song Yellow Coat. Darnielle released his first album, Taboo VI: The Homecoming, on Shrimper Records. Many of his first recordings and performances featured Darnielle accompanied by members of the all-girl reggae band, The Casual Girls, who became known as The Bright Mountain Choir. One of this group's members, Rachel Ware, continued to accompany Darnielle on bass, both live and in studio, until 1995.

&gt; Highly prolific, since the early 90s Darnielle has released over a dozen Mountain Goats albums, 6 full-length cassettes, various 7” singles, 10"" and 12"" EPs and has contributed to compilations and label samplers too numerous to mention. As of November 2006, the Mountain Goats’ song catalog encompasses 452 songs, a fair number of which have only been played live. Among this bewildering number of tunes is a song cycle named the “Alpha” series, about a dysfunctional couple, as well as one named the “Going To…” series, about people going someplace or other, usually not for fun but rather to flee from a bad situation in their lives. The last series alone totals over 40 songs to date.  Additional song cycles from Darnielle's extensive repertoire include the ""Standard Bitter Love Song #..."" series, the ""Orange Ball Of..."" series, and the ""Pure..."" series, as well as a series of songs whose titles are simply chapters and verses from the Bible (""I Corinthians 13 8-10"", etc.).

&gt; Although his last six albums (since Darnielle signed with 4AD Records) have seen more hi-fi production values, most of the Mountain Goats' recorded output is extremely lo-fi, the only accompaniment to Darnielle’s razor-sharp lyrics being an acoustic guitar and the occasional input of backing vocals, and then the sound of the tape recorder permeating the track at all times, effectively serving as a backing track in its own right.

&gt; In addition to his work with The Mountain Goats, Darnielle has also collaborated with Franklin Bruno (of Nothing Painted Blue) in The Extra Glenns (later named The Extra Lens).

&gt; Darnielle’s song ""Cotton"" was featured in the Showtime show Weeds. It can be heard in the middle and at the end of the 9th episode, The Punishment Light.

&gt; The songs ""No Children,"" ""Old College Try,"" and ""Love Love Love"" were each featured in separate episodes of the television series Moral Orel's third season, which has featured major running themes of alcoholism, regret, and domestic discontent.

13840,"I don't use hyperbole often but I honestly think Chance might end up going down as one of the best musicians ever. Not just based on his music but what he's done to give back to the Chicago community and his political stances he's taken. He's taking the power he truly has in his position and using it to make a difference. 

I never understood the hype my friends had around Chance. I first downloaded Acid Rap and wasn't that into it. Probably listened to it twice and gave up on it. Juice was like the only song I remembered and I honestly thought it was just songs that had annoying sounds and were different. Then I downloaded Coloring Book because everyone was talking about it and listened to it once and thought it was alright. Frank Ocean's Blonde came out around the same time and I definitely gave it way more attention. Then somewhere along the way I listened to it more and more to the point I was obsessed.

Then I went back to Acid Rap and realized how great of an album (not mixtape in my book) it is. Every song is great and it has everything from bangers to slow jams that'll make you think. ""Paranoia"" on it is by far my favorite song and I recommend everyone listen to it, but really pay attention to the words. When he talks about it being summer and wanting it to rain, hating the sound of fireworks, and how everyone dies in the summer it's just depressing but he sings it so beautifully.

My whole point is, if you don't understand the music or like him... give it some time. Listen to coloring book and Acid Rap like 4-5 times before making a decision and you'll slowly find yourself loving every song. 

Sorry for the book I wrote. I've just been wanting to get my Chance rant out of my system for a while now haha

13918,"&gt; but no-one immediately recognises the source of the sample (Straight to Hell)

lots of people did... mostly clash fans, and music nerds. but you bring up a good point — i was just thinking about this myself, but with röyksopp ([happy up here](http://vimeo.com/3281558)/[do that stuff](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCOe32Fgldo)). 

i don't know...i might not always like the result, but if the artists credit the sample i guess i don't really see the problem. especially when it's the backbone to the track, like the two songs mentioned.. which they *appear* to do ([Junior](http://www.discogs.com/R%C3%B6yksopp-Junior/release/1702360)/[Kala](http://www.discogs.com/MIA-Kala/release/1046072)) — though röyksopp seems to have given writing credit, whereas M.I.A. just mentioned that track 11 ""incorporates elements of Straight To Hell by The Clash"". either way the info is there... if the listeners don't know, it's their own fault. 

that said, i think that info should be a little more apparent... because people are lazy and if they knew, upfront, how much of the song is ""borrowed"", they would probably form a slightly different opinion of the artist they claim to idolize.

**EDIT:** i should add that i actually do like ""happy up here"", and i don't hate ""paper planes"". i just think that if people are going to really get into these types of songs and claim to love the artist that produced them, they should be a little better informed.",Music
13935,"You know, i was honestly not a fan of this at all. not saying I dont like her voice, i just think they sound pretty random together. I guess im not really big on her lyrics either.

The range and strength is pretty weak, i feel if Tosin is playing for you while you sing, your vocal range better be 8 goddamn string worthy.",Music

The Beach Boys do great stuff, check out ""God Only Knows"" or ""Sloop John B"" for some cool examples. And so those are the obvious ones. But if I were you man I would check out Prince and Michael Jackson because especially Michael knew how to layer with himself. Just listen to any Michael song and try to listen for the vocal parts. Listen to how many vocalizations and vocal contributions there exist in each part. It might even be easier to hear the isolated a capella versions because it's just so dense it's almost like a wall of sound. Unbelievably imaginative.
I know you said you were interested in some non-english stuff and I see Chico Buarque there, so I'm not sure if these are the types of harmonies you're looking for but I'd check out Djavan, Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Ed Motta, Tim Maia, and go from there. MPB greats!
I'd also check out Sly and the Family Stone and dig into Motown stuff, too.

&gt; The Band was an influential Canadian-American rock and roll group of the 1960s and '70s, formed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The Band included Robbie Robertson (guitar, piano, drums, harmonica); Richard Manuel (1943-1986) (piano, harmonica, drums, saxophone, organ, slide guitar); Garth Hudson (organ, piano, clavinet, accordion, synthesizer, saxophone); Rick Danko (1943-1999) (bass guitar, violin, trombone, guitar), and Levon Helm (1940-2012) (drums, mandolin, guitar, bass guitar, harmonica).

&gt; The members of The Band first worked together as The Hawks, the backing band of rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins from 1959 until 1963. Afterwards, Bob Dylan recruited the quintet for his history-making 1965/1966 world tour and they joined him on the informal recordings that became the acclaimed Basement Tapes.

&gt; Dubbed ""The Band"" by their peers, the group left the comfort of their communal home in Saugerties, NY to begin recording as a group unto themselves. The Band recorded two of the most important albums of the late 1960s: their 1968 debut Music from Big Pink (featuring the hit single ""The Weight"") and 1969's The Band. These critically praised albums helped conceive country rock as something more than a genre, but rather as a celebration of ""Americana."" As such, throughout their career they would repopularize traditional American musical forms during the psychedelic era. The Band dissolved in 1976; Martin Scorcese's landmark concert film ""The Last Waltz"" documented their final performance.  They reformed in 1983 without founding guitarist and main songwriter Robbie Robertson.

&gt; Although always more popular with music journalists and fellow musicians than the general public, The Band has remained an admired and influential group. They have been inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

&gt; Their music fused many elements: primarily old country music and early rock and roll, though the rhythm section often had a bouncy, funky punch reminiscent of Stax or Motown, and Robertson cites Curtis Mayfield and the Staple Singers as major influences. At its best, however, The Band's music was an organic synthesis of many musical genres which became more than the sum of its parts. The group's songwriting was also remarkable as, unlike much earlier rock and roll, and following upon the example set previously by The Byrds, very few of their early compositions were based on conventional blues and doo-wop chord changes.

&gt; The Band comprised Robbie Robertson (guitar); Richard Manuel (piano, harmonica, drums, saxophone); Garth Hudson (organ, piano, clavinet, accordion, synthesizer, saxophone); Rick Danko (bass guitar, violin, trombone); and Levon Helm (drums, mandolin, guitar, bass guitar) Excepting Robertson, all were multi-instrumentalists; each person's primary instrument is listed first. There was little instrument-switching when they played live, but when recording, the musicians could offer all manner of subtle aural colors and textures to enhance songs. Hudson in particular was able to coax an impressive range of timbres from his Lowrey electronic organ; on the choruses of ""Tears of Rage"", for example, it sounds startlingly like a mellotron. Helm's drumming was rarely flashy, but he was often praised for his subtlety and funkiness. Critic Jon Carroll famously declared that Helm was ""the only drummer who can make you cry,"" while prolific session drummer Jim Keltner admits to appropriating several of Helm's techniques.

&gt; Singers Manuel, Danko, and Helm each brought a distinctive voice to The Band: Helm's gritty, southern voice had more than a hint of country, Danko sang in a soaring, unfettered tenor, and Manuel alternated between fragile falsetto and a wounded baritone. The singers regularly blended in unorthodox, but uncommonly effective harmonies. Though the singing was more or less evenly shared between the three men, both Danko and Helm have stated that they saw Manuel as the Band's ""lead"" singer.

&gt; Robertson was the unit's chief songwriter (though he sang lead vocals on only three or four songs in The Band's career). This role, and Robertson's resulting claim to the copyright of most of the compositions, would become a point of much antipathy between the group's members, especially between Robertson and Helm.

&gt; Producer John Simon is cited as a ""sixth member"" of The Band for producing and playing on Music from Big Pink, co-producing and playing on The Band, and playing on other songs up through The Band's 1993 reunion album Jericho.

&gt; On 10 December 1999 is when Rick Danko died in his sleep at age 56. He had been a long-time drug user. In 1997 he had been found guilty of trying to smuggle heroin into Japan. He told the presiding judge that he had begun using the drug (together with prescription morphine) to fight life-long pain resulting from a 1968 auto accident. No drugs were found in his system at the time of his death. Following the death of Rick Danko, The Band broke up for good.

&gt; Levon Helm died on 19 April 2012 from complications of throat cancer.

Sure, they were funny to make fun of and sometimes very simplistic, but it was that voice that was so universal and relatable to some of us that were feeling real emotions like this. I promise you, as someone who has been there before, the feeling of hopelessness that comes with a disease as cruel as depression leaves wounds that really don't heal. You look back even long after recovery and feel desperate to find a way to tell your former self that there is a future for them. And some of us never recover. 

I cannot begin to imagine the pain Chester went though, and the suffering his family feels in this moment. The blame for him leaving his family behind must be placed solely on the disease that claimed his mind. Suffering in this manner isn't a joke, or a meme. It's a reality for so many more people than we possibly realize, and talking openly and candidly about these emotions and feelings are the only way we could ever hope to incite real change in the perception of mental illness.

&gt; Adele Laurie Blue Adkins, (born 5 May 1988), is a Grammy Award-Winning English singer-songwriter from Enfield, North London. Her debut album, 19, was released in January 2008 and entered the UK album chart at #1. The album has since received four-times Platinum certification in the UK and has sold 5,500,000 copies worldwide. The album included the hugely popular song Chasing Pavements. 19 earned Adele two Grammy Awards in February 2009 for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. 

&gt; Her second album, 21, was released on January 24th 2011 in the UK and propelled Adele to unprecedented mega-stardom. In just eleven months, 21 received fourteen-times Platinum certification in the UK for shipments in excess of 4,500,000 copies, and has sold a further 6,200,000 copies in the US denoting sextuple-Platinum status. As of January 2012, 21 has sold an estimated seventeen million copies worldwide. The album has produced three global chart-topping singles thus far: Rolling in the Deep, Someone Like You, and Set Fire to the Rain. 21 won Adele six awards at the 2012 Grammy Awards, among them Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Record of the Year.

&gt; Adele graduated from BRIT School in Croydon in May 2006, where she was classmates with Leona Lewis. Adele credits the school with nurturing her talent. In school, she was more interested in going into A&amp;R, and hoped to launch other people's careers. Four months later, she published two songs on the fourth issue of the online arts publication PlatformsMagazine.com. She had recorded a three-song demo for a class project and gave it to a friend who posted it on Myspace where it became very successful and led to a phone call from music label XL Recordings. She doubted if the offer was real because the only record company she knew was Virgin Records, and she took a friend with her to the meeting. Nick Huggett at XL Recordings recommended Adele to manager Jonathan Dickins at September Management and in June 2006 Dickins became her official representative. September was managing Jamie T at the time and this proved a major attraction for Adele who was a big fan of the English singer-songwriter. Huggett then signed Adele to XL Recordings in September 2006.

&gt; Adele's breakthrough song, Hometown Glory, was released in October 2007. Adele provided vocals for Jack Peñate's song, My Yvonne, from his debut album. Adele became the first recipient of the BRIT Awards Critics' Choice and was named the number-one predicted breakthrough act of 2008 in an annual BBC poll of music critics, Sound of 2008. She released her second single Chasing Pavements on 14 January 2008, two weeks ahead of her debut album, 19. Chasing Pavements reached number two on the UK Chart, and stayed there for four weeks, finally remaining in the Top 40 14 weeks after its release. The album itself entered the British charts at number one. The Times Encyclopedia of Modern Music would name 19 an ""essential"" Blue Eyed Soul recording.

&gt; In June 2013, Adele was awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours list for services to music.

&gt; The much-anticipated third studio album ""25"" was released on November 20, 2015 on the label XL. The first single from the album, ""Hello"", was released on Friday, October 23, 2015.  

&gt; Grammy Awards (2017) - At the 59th Grammy Awards on Sun, February 12, 2017, Adele took the awards for ""Album of The Year"" and ""Best Pop Vocal Album"" for ""25"". and ""Song Of The Year"" and ""Best Pop Solo Performance"" for ""Hello"". Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Era Istrefi (born 4 July 1995), sometimes known as simply Era (stylized as ERA), is an Albanian Kosovar singer and songwriter. She rose to fame after releasing her debut single ""Mani për money"" in 2013, which gained a positive feedback and attention from the public. Her following songs ""A po don"" and ""E dehun"", gained the same success. In June 2014, she won three Videofest awards for her music videos, including ""Best New Artist"" for her work in 2013.

&gt; In 2015 Era gained success with her song ""Njo si ti"" with over a million views on YouTube in a week. Her first duo featuring well-known Kosovo rapper Ledri Vula, ""Shumë pis"", became a summer hit.

&gt; Counting Crows is an American rock band originating from Berkeley, California. Formed in 1991, the group gained fame in 1993 following the release of their debut album, titled 'August and Everything After', when track ""Mr. Jones"" became a big hit. Known for their melancholic yet melodic songwriting, the band started when singer Adam Duritz (previously of The Himalayans and Sordid Humor) teamed up with guitarist David Bryson (local producer and former member of the band Mr. Dog) in San Francisco, California in 1990. Counting Crows originally performed as an acoustic duo, playing gigs in and around the cities of Berkeley and San Francisco.

&gt; For the group's first album, Adam and David added bassist Matt Malley, multi-instrument talent Charlie Gillingham, and drummer Steve Bowman.  David Immergluck served as the second guitarist on the first album, but he did not officially join the band until 1999.  Guitarist Dan Vickery was added just as the band set out on their first tour. As stated before, 'August and Everything After' provided the band with a surprise yet very welcome success, garnering them critical praise. Released on September 14, 1993 through Geffen Records, the album hit #2 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart, showing that their tunes had tapped into something.

&gt; Counting Crows, with their intimate and confessional yet smooth, often catchy musical approach, achieved a large fan base among melodic rock fans over the years. Their 90s acclaim reflected that a significant music scene looked for something different from the raging guitars of the Seattle-based grunge movement as well as from either boilerplate pop music or the budding electronic music subgenres. The group kept on releasing new songs into the new millennium.

&gt; The band's more recent successes include the 2004 hit song ""Accidentally In Love"", which was featured on the Shrek 2 soundtrack (that has sold over 1,000,000 copies). That song has also garnered nominations for a Grammy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award. That same year, the band released their first ever best of set, which they titled 'Films about Ghosts'. That album features songs from every phase of the Counting Crows' recording career. To date, the band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide. 

&gt; The group made the news when 'Saturday Nights &amp; Sunday Mornings' was released on March 25th, 2008. In addition, on January 16, 2008, the band released a digital EP as a free download on their official web site, consisting of the songs ""1492"" and ""When I Dream Of Michelangelo"". The lead single from the album was ""You Can't Count On Me"", which was released for radio play on February 4, 2008.

&gt; The album itself is thematically and stylistically divided into two parts: the first, more rock-influenced Saturday Nights, and the second, more country-influenced Sunday Mornings. Theme changes along with style; in the Sunday Mornings portion of the album, songs become more reflective. The iTunes release contains several bonus tracks, including a track-by-track interview with Duritz.

17219,"Because radio is very formulaic now that it is controlled by clear channel aka iheart radio. Also why most genres have died in the mainstream as there is little exposure to new artists. Music on the radio are essentially advertisements for studios vanilla ""artisits"". Or they are decent artists forced to produce something generic for the radio.

This is because radio time is bought by the studios now, and so we then hear the same 7 songs on repeat for like half a year. Radio time among other things to sell their artist is pricey. This much investment means they cant take risks anymore and need a sure thing to turn a profit. Unlike the pre iheart radio years where there was vastly more variety and more artists or artists getting exposure. Also you had to EARN your spot to be on the radio. Criteria being unique and not awful and or amazing. Dj used to for example put something out there, because they acted as your gateway to music and were music heads, and ask listeners opinions of that song.

Tl;dr radio is all about money now. Everything sounds the same because it is. Go on soundcloud or youtube if you want the pre iheartradio experience. Radio time is bought not earned and artisits are peddled on the radio as brands for demographics. They are cookie cutter and sold like cookies, I.e. Products. Radio is no longer a means to expose you to the language of feeling.

&gt; Deaf Havana are an English alt rock sextet from King's Lynn in the UK. The band was formed in 2005 at the King's Lynn campus of The College of West Anglia. The band's early releases along with constant touring developed a strong fan base in the UK music scene. The name Deaf Havana came from their former guitarist Sebastian Spitz, but the name itself has no literal meaning.

&gt; Deaf Havana was formed when the original members met at the King's Lynn campus of The College of West Anglia. The bands roots can, however, be traced back much further with Ryan Mellor, James Veck-Gilodi and Lee Wilson all attending Smithdon High School and playing together in Various local scene bands. At college, these members were joined by Tom Ogden and Sebastian Spitz, this early lineup saw James singing and Ryan taking guitar/unclean vocal duties.
The band quickly got down to writing songs and an early 7-track demo, titled White Lines But No Camera, which was recorded August 2006 at the Lodge, Northampton. The band toured this lineup until the departure of Sebastian and the introduction of Chris Pennells, formerly a member of the band ""Something About Dave"", who took over guitar duties. 

&gt; In late 2006 the band began writing songs for their debut EP, entitled ""Evangeline"". Two songs were roughly recorded, titled ""The Smiles Were Forced"" and ""Where It Begins"", which were uploaded on to the band's myspace page; open to opinions and criticism from their rather small fanbase. The EP was soon recorded and mixed (with ""The Smiles Were Forced"" being dropped from the EP's tracklisting). The EP saw the light of day at the beginning of 2007.

&gt; Around the same time, Ryan Mellor handed over guitar parts to James, and took on the role as front man.

&gt; October 2007 saw the band begin work on the songs that would become their first release.
On the 21st of June 2008 the band announced the signing of a 1 EP 2 Album deal with Wolf At Your Door Records as well as the recording date for their debut E.P.

&gt; The E.P. was eventually recorded by Jonny Renshaw from Devil Sold His Soul and was mixed by Matt O'Grady (You Me At Six, Architects). In October 2008 the band released this recording through their label, the E.P. titled It's Called the Easy Life received strong reviews from various musical publications. On the back of this success the band begin to receive some recognition. January 2009 saw the band complete a UK wide tour with We Are The Ocean - The Urgency, and around the same time, release their first music video for ""Oh Howard, You Crack Me Up"".

&gt; On the 25th May 2009 the band entered the studio to record their debut studio album. The full-length titled ""Meet Me Halfway, At Least"" was released for exclusive pre-order from Wolf At Your Door Records on 7th September and was released on iTunes and shops on 5th October 2009.

&gt; There has been two singles to date that have been taken off this album. ""Friends Like These"" was released, with exclusive B-side ""Hey Baby, This Is Our Song"", on 17 August 2009 for digital download through iTunes and other online outlets. A video was also released on the likes of Scuzz and Kerrang! Their second single, ""Nicotine And Alcohol Saved My Life"", will be released on 15 March 2010 for digital download. With the single, there will also be a remix of ""Friends Like These"" by Essex-based 6 piece, Kenai. The video was released on the music channels and online on 22 February 2010.

&gt; Before the release of the album, Deaf Havana embarked on the ""Metal Hammer Introducing"" Tour along with Young Guns and The Casino Brawl. This tour took them all over the UK. A week after the last date, Deaf Havana played a home town show in King's Lynn as an album release party. Support for this show came from Underline The Sky and All Forgotten.

&gt; 2010 see's Deaf Havana on several tours across the UK and Europe; A headlining UK mini tour with All Forgotten and Francesqa in March, a European tour with Emery in March/April, and a support slot on Emarosa's UK tour in May. Just before the start of the mini tour with All Forgotten, it was announced via the band's myspace and facebook, that Ryan would not be embarking on these future tours with them due to personal problems. To take his place on the tours, Deaf Havana enrolled Max d'Albiac from a band called Brides.

&gt; On 10 May 2010, it was announced via the band's Facebook and Myspace, that Ryan would unfortunately be leaving the band due to the same, unresolved personal reasons that caused him to pull out of the recent tours. Deaf Havana would be continuing on as a 4 piece. As a result, they are getting rid of all screams in future releases, mainly because they feel it would be wrong to replace Ryan.

&gt; The band have already started to write the follow up to 2009's ""Meet Me Halfway, At Least"". A few days after announcing the departure of Ryan, Deaf Havana released a new demo track on Myspace and Facebook, entitled ""My Life Is Average"". This saw the band going back to how they were before the line-up change in 2006, opting for a softer sound, yet still incorporating the sound they had established over the previous album and EP.

&gt; On May 29 and May 30, 2010, Deaf Havana played on the Kerrang! Introducing Stage at Slam Dunk Fesitval at University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield and University of Leeds respectively. At these shows, the band opened with a new song, of which the title wasn't revealed. On August 7, 2010 they will play at the Hevy Music Festival held near Folkestone, Kent.

&gt; On the 19th of May the band released the video for the song 'The World or Nothing' from their new untitled album, the song is not a single and isn't released as a download, the song furthers the band's progress into a new pop punk sound.

&gt; Fools and Worthless Liars was released on the 7th November 2011, coinciding with London Barfly and Norwich Arts Centre release gigs. The album peaked at #1 on the BBC Rock Album Chart. In late November and early December the band toured Europe as direct support to Skindred before returning to the UK to support Architects on their tour through mid December. The band are to perform their own UK headline tour through April 2012. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Anamanaguchi is a four-piece band from New York City that makes emotional punk, pop, &amp; dance music using hacked Nintendos, Game Boys, and 16-bit soundscapes. Members include Peter Berkman (guitar, songwriting), Ary Warnaar (guitar, songwriting), James DeVito (bass, stage visuals engineer), and Luke Silas (drums, solo act 'knife city'). A member of the artist collective 8bitpeoples, Peter Berkman had been creating chiptune music since 2003. Their debut album, 'Power Supply' EP, was released in 2006 as a free download. The name ""Anamanaguchi"" came about from the members' internships at Armani (Berkman and DeVito), Prada (Warnaar), and Gucci (Silas) while studying fashion at Parsons School of Design.

&gt; On March 3, 2009 they released their first full-length album, 'Dawn Metropolis', featuring 7 songs that pushed the chiptune-rock formula to a new level and included a website full of visual landscapes for the tracks. The following Summer the band began releasing free downloadable ""summer singles"" on their website: 'Airbrushed', 'My Skateboard Will Go On', Aurora (Meet me in the Stars)', and 'Mess'. The band was later commissioned by Universal &amp; Scott Pilgrim creator Bryan Lee O'Malley to create 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game (Original Videogame Soundtrack)' to coincide with the movie of the same title.

&gt; In 2013, Anamanaguchi released their first live action music video featuring a new single MEOW. During a hugely successful Kickstarter Campaign with the promise of making it ""more than just an album"", the band released 'Endless Fantasy', a 22-track full-length album under their own record label, 'dream.hax'. Setting the stage for a new era in Guch history, the band reaches the far ends of the galaxy with its sound and has no sign of slowing down here on spaceship earth! ( n_n)b

Write, for example,'The night is shattered

The night wind revolves in the sky and sings. 

Tonight I can write the saddest lines. 
I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too. 

Through nights like this one I held her in my arms 
I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.

She loved me sometimes, and I loved her too. 
How could one not have loved her great still eyes. 

Tonight I can write the saddest lines. 
To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her. 

To hear the immense night, still more immense without her. 
And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture. 

What does it matter that my love could not keep her. 
The night is shattered and she is not with me. 

This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance. 
My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her. 

My sight searches for her as though to go to her. 
My heart looks for her, and she is not with me. 

The same night whitening the same trees. 
We, of that time, are no longer the same. 

I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her. 
My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing. 

Another's. She will be another's. Like my kisses before. 
Her voide. Her bright body. Her inifinite eyes. 

I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her. 
Love is so short, forgetting is so long. 

Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms 
my sould is not satisfied that it has lost her. 

Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer 
and these the last verses that I write for her.

&gt; RP Boo, a.k.a. Arpebu is basically the godfather of footwork as a genre of music, taking juke from a 4-on-the-floor house pattern to the bent bass that changed the sound forever. One of his pivotal moments was when he butchered the pitch of a now deceased Wu Tang member’s voice into an even more staggering utterance on Baby Come On. He was also part of House–O–Matics along with several other DJs back in the mid 90s, one of the OG footwork crews.  Read more on Last.fm.

18879,"**UGK - Int'l Players (feat. OutKast)**: I was familiar with OutKast, but only really Hey Ya/I Like the Way You Move/Ms. Jackson, then I heard the last song off Girl Talk's second album (#SuburbanWhiteKid) where he samples the end of Andre's verse (Keep your heart, 3 stacks, keep your heart...). I thought the line was great so I googled it to see what song it came from, then I downloaded it. That song is now possibly my favourite of all time and since hearing ATLiens/Aquemini I'd definitely call OK my favourite band. Everything they do is good.

**Kanye West - Stronger**: You could say that this song was my introduction to hip hop in general. I hated rap in seventh grade, then by eighth and ninth grade I tolerated it. I had a buddy in ninth grade who was big into rap and would occasionally send me songs and when this song first came out he sent me the video. It was dope, the Daft Punk sample was crazy. I downloaded the album as soon as it came out and listened to it at least once a day - usually more - for weeks. His sampling was mindblowing for me, my idea of rap was mostly based on music videos, school dances *The Eminem Show* and to me 'rap' was everything from R Kelly to Lil' Jon. I didn't know it could be this melodic and introspective. So I started listening to more rap, and now I'm a hip hop nerd to the fullest. I listened to that album way too much though, and there are only one or two songs off it that I can listen to now without wanting to blow my brains out.

**Lil' Wayne - It's Me Bitches (remix)**: Not the one off the Drought 3. The one with R Kelly on it. The same friend sent me this track during the same summer, and it also contributed to me getting into  rap. I loved the wordplay. ""He's so sweet, make me wanna lick the wrapper / so I let her lick the rapper"" (which he re-used in Lollipop, of course). I though Kells' line ""Makin' her moan, we're having sex to the song / after sex, I beat my chest like I'm King Kong"" was hilarious; I'd listen to the song just to hear that line. Eventually I realized that I'd memorized not only his whole verse, but the whole song, ad-libs and all. I downloaded the next bootleg Lil' Wayne mixtape that came out and, even though most of the songs on that were total crap aside from a couple that ended up on the Carter 3 and one with Twista, I loved it.",Music

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/fde9d0b8306d4289b6c3c59cd95d6b04.png)  

&gt; The Outfield was an arena rock-influenced British pop rock/power pop power trio based in the East End of London, England. Its members were bassist/singer Tony Lewis, guitarist/keyboardist and songwriter John Spinks, and drummer Alan Jackman.  Originally known as the 'Baseball Boys' before singing with Columbia/CBS Records in 1984, the guys were unusual for a British band in that they enjoyed commercial success in the U.S. with new wave hits such as ""All of the Love"" and ""Your Love"" but never reached the album or singles charts in their homeland.

&gt; They began recording during the mid-80s, picking up the name 'Baseball Boys' as a reference from a gang of hooligans from the cult film 'The Warriors'. Changing things around to 'The Outfield', perhaps a hint of their later American success due to their affinity for U.S. culture, they released their first album, titled 'Play Deep', in 1985 through Columbia Records. Picking up critical acclaim for their melodic rock sound, the album reached #9 on the Billboard 200 list and ended up reaching triple platinum status in America. As remarked by an Allmusic reviewer, the band had a knack for making ""a harmonious chorus that is overly smooth and rock savvy."" Their single ""Your Love"" reached #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 as well as #7 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart, and it soon became their 'signature song. It has went on to be featured in a number of 80s-themed compilation albums, and over a thousand covers and remixes by other artists have been released physically and/or online. Other singles ""Say It Isn't So"" and ""Everytime You Cry"" also made it into the top 20 on Mainstream Rock chart.

&gt; Though possibly peaking too early, the band continued to record and tour through the 80s and then into the early 90s as the Anglo-American pop rock and power pop scenes evolved. While their second album, titled 'Bangin'', hit the top 20 on the Billboard 200 list had both singles hit the top 40 on the Mainstream Rock chart, the group began losing their popular audience by their third album, 'Voices of Babylon', came out in 1989. Though receiving critical acclaim, the rock mainstream seemed to have shifted considerably underneath them. Drummer Alan Jackman left, and, now as a duo, they recorded 'Diamond Days' in 1991. After the disappointing response to their 1992 album 'Rockeye', which represented a shift towards progressive rock and arena rock, the group essentially disbanded for much of the 90s.

&gt; They resumed touring in 1998, and thereafter the band released two live albums via their website. The group's comeback album, 'Any Time Now', was released by Sidewinder Records in March 2006 and constituted a comeback to their traditional pop rock sound. In mid-2009, the Outfield entered a London studio to begin recording their seventh studio album. Titled 'Replay', it saw a June 28, 2011 release, with the band's cult following enjoying deliberately retro sounding songs such as ""California Sun"". Their music popping up in various places (from Katy Perry recording a Outfield cover titled ""Use Your Love"" to the 'Grand Theft Auto: Vice City' video game using their music), the guys had somewhat of a resurgence of interest at the tail end of their career. Although popular interest in the band waxed and waned since their 80s musical heyday, their group maintained a devoted fan base among followers of the power pop genre for many years.

&gt; Guitarist and songwriter John Spinks sadly passed away in July 2014, succumbing to liver cancer after a long and tough battle. He was 60. The group released a statement saying: “We are relieved that his passing was peaceful and painless.” It also remarked that the future of the band appeared ""unclear"". With unreleased songs in the bin, the Outfield may well return in some form. Read more on Last.fm.

19676,"Pop, Rap, and Country are the most ""commercial"" genres in the music industry.  

Most songs in that genre aren't pieces of art, crafted by a musician's personality and experiences and passion, but overpriced cups of coffee that you can't go three blocks without seeing repeated.  And unlike the coffee chain, when it comes to popular (the term i'll use to refer to those three genres for the remainder of this post) music, you don't even get to add a few little customizations to your steaming heap of bland, mass-produced vice.

Songs in those genres are written, re-written, edited, cut apart and pasted, and edited again by an team consisting of linguists and psychologists, sometimes, but not always, with a specific ""artist"" in mind, all of whom share the same goal: making the lyrical content appeal to as broad an audience as possible.  The more people you can hook with the song, the more profit you can generate through album sales, concert tickets, youtube views, etc.

But historically (i'm talking late nineties, which was basically the birth of pop music as we know it) it took a while for lovers of pop music to embrace country or rap, and vice versa, v.v...Just like weaning a baby onto solid food or changing your dogs diet, spoonfeeding people a little bit of something new stirred in with something they already like can help alter their tastes.  Enough of that, and someone who is a die-hard, coal-rolling, tobacco spitting, trump-voting, ain't never gonna have me a black president"" Good Ol' Country boy is eventually listening to rap music.  

It's Gateway music, really.

The modern music industry isn't about music.  Like everything else in our lives, it's about profits.  The artists and the songs are as disposable as a diaper, and often just as full as shit.  The songs are engineered and analyzed and produced, meant to be consumed as quickly and as often as possible and then to fall by the wayside to make room for the next profiteering nearly-naked lass singing about her ex boyfriend or pretty boy talking about how he's going to ""sex you good.""  And by ""blurring the lines"" between what is radio Pop, what is Country, and what is Rap, executives are ensuring that their materialistic profiteering hooks are snagging as many people from as many different demographics as possible.",Music

I like some metal. It's probably my third most listened to genre. I also recognize that it's a small subsection of what metal encompasses. 

I find a vast majority of metal to be a pissing contest rather than an actual expression of music. So much of metal is filled with how intense and how extreme can you go rather than trying to create actual harmonious sounds. 

Allot of it comes down to how I define music. To me music needs a play between building tension and relieving tension and, *much like bad dubstep*, allot of metal is built around constantly increasing tension. It's exhausting to listen to metal because it doesn't breathe well. It's always screaming at the top of it's lungs trying to belt out the sounds of a hellmouth. 

Call me old-school but I haven't found a band that plays modern metal to anywhere near the same level of emotional impact as the guys who've been around since before like 97.

Let's see, my favorite all-time album is Face-Off by Pastor Troy. I listen to every single song on that album and it also has my favorite rap song, Vice Versa. His voice, the way that he is on the fence with God and the devil and his beats just make it complete. P. Troy is a grinder and, with the exception of one album, he makes music purely for the fans. I love Lil Wyte and Doubt Me Now is pretty awesome. He might as well be a junkie, but he has a lot of force for a little white guy. Marshall Mathers LP, absolutely. I realized that I never really listened to The Chronic, so I did. Love it. Mos Def and Talib Kweli are Blackstarr, excellent. Scarface's The Fix is classic. Kanye's newest album is a masterpiece too.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/dd463f5c63464b299616ef2baef598f1.png)  

&gt; Etta James (1938-2012) was a U.S.  blues, soul, R&amp;B, rock &amp; roll, and jazz singer and songwriter. She is the winner of four Grammies, seventeen Blues Music Awards, and was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame (in 1993), the Blues Hall of Fame (in 2001), and the Grammy Hall of Fame (in both 1999 and 2008).

&gt; James was born Jamesetta Hawkins in Los Angeles, California, on 25th January 1938, to an unmarried fourteen-year-old mother, Dorothy Hawkins. According to Etta, her mother claimed that her father was the white Rudolph  ""Minnesota Fats"" Wanderone, and that they received financial support from him on the condition that they keep his paternity a secret. This seems unlikely, though it has not been definitively disproved. Etta was born in Los Angeles in 1938. At the time, Wanderone was known to be managing a pool hall in Washington, D.C. and had not yet become known to be the cross-country traveller he later became. 

&gt; She received her first professional vocal training at five years old from James Earle Hines, musical director of the Echoes of Eden choir at St Paul Baptist Church in Los Angeles.  Her family moved to San Francisco in 1950, and she teamed up with two other girls to form a doo-wop singing group. When the girls were fourteen, band leader Johnny Otis had them audition. They sang an answer to Hank Ballard's ""Work with Me, Annie"" called ""Roll Wwth Me Henry"".  Otis particularly liked the song, and against her mother's wishes, James and the trio went to Los Angeles to record the song in 1954. The song was recorded on the label Modern Records. By this time, the trio renamed the song ""The Wallflower (Dance with Me, Henry)"" and released it in 1955. James named her vocal group The Peaches. Richard Berry, a Los Angeles doo-wop luminary, is featured on some of their records.

&gt; ""The Wallflower"" reached number two on the rhythm and blues charts in February 1955, but was undercut in the wider market by a rushed-out cover version by Georgia Gibbs on Mercury Records; in fact, the very first time Gibbs was recorded in studio, they used the first take recorded and it became number one on the top 100 songs nationally. The song's royalties were divided between Hank Ballard, Etta James, and Johnny Otis, and its huge success attracted the attention of the R&amp;B world, resulting in James going on tour with Little Richard. On the tour, though, according to James, she witnessed and experienced situations to which minors are not usually privy, and she allegedly acquired a drug habit.

&gt; Soon after the success of ""Wallflower"", The Peaches and James parted company, but this did not halt her career. Shecontinued to record and release albums throughout much of the decade, and enjoyed more success. Her follow-up, ""Good Rockin' Daddy"", became another fifties hit. Other songs however, such as ""Tough Lover"" and ""W-O-M-A-N"" failed to gain any significant success. James toured with Johnny ""Guitar"" Watson and Otis Redding in the fifties, and has cited Watson as the most significant influence on her style..

&gt; In 1960, James signed a recording contract with Chess Records. She went on to have the biggest success of her career from this label, recording her biggest and most memorable hits. Chess went into high gear with James, releasing many duets with her then boyfriend, the married Harvey Fuqua, who was the lead singer of the Moonglows. One of her duets with Fuqua, ""If I Can't Have You"", became a hit on the R&amp;B charts in 1960. As a solo artist however, she had more enduring success. One of her first singles released by Chess in 1960 was called ""All I Could Do Was Cry""; this blues number became a big hit on the R&amp;B charts in 1960. Leonard Chess, one of the founders of Chess Records, helped James along the way. He saw the potential for her to go in a more pop-oriented direction, and she started recording more pop tunes for the label.

&gt; The year 1961 became a year of great change for James. In 1961 came the release of one of her first pop-oriented tunes called ""At Last"". The song became a big hit in 1961, reaching number two on the R&amp;B charts. The song even went as far as twenty-two on the pop charts that year. It became her signature song. Other songs, such as ""Trust in Me"", also became hits, and the 1962 tune ""Something's Got a Hold On Me"" showed more of James' gospel side, a genre she had sung since childhood.

&gt; She had other big hits in the 1960s, but mainly on the R&amp;B charts: the song ""Pushover"" in 1963 and ""Stop the Wedding"", ""Fool That I Am"", and ""Don't Cry Baby"", were hits for her between 1961 and 1963. Her 1963 album Etta James Rocks the House, recorded at Nashville's ""New Era"" club, also gave her career a boost. James then became one of the most successful R&amp;B artists of the 1960s, having many more top ten and top twenty hit singles. Performing in Memphis, Tennessee helped make her into a blues icon.

&gt; In 1967, James released her next hit single, ""Tell Mama"", and it became a top ten hit on the R&amp;B charts. After a dry period of no hits for almost four years, the song once more made James a household name. The follow-up, ""Security"", was also a success, and proved that James had staying power on the charts again. Whilst less success came for James after this hit, she was still on the charts regularly and, despite the death of Leonard Chess, stayed with the Chess label into 1975. Towards the end of the Chess years though, she went into more rock-based songs. She recorded for many other labels, and continued to release albums, such as 1978's Deep In the Night on Atlantic Records.

&gt; Despite a dry period during the early to mid 1980s, James got back on track and began to record music again. She received accolades for her 1981 rendition of Randy Newman's ""God's Song"". Her 1988 album Seven Year Itch proved this comeback capability; the album showed more of her soul side. In 1989, she recorded the song ""Avenue D"" with David A. Stewart of Eurythmics. The song was featured on the soundtrack to the Robert Wise film Rooftops. She also performed with the Grateful Dead for two shows in 1982. In the 1990s she continued to record and perform. Her albums widely varied in styles and genres. Her 1992 album, The Right Time, was another soul album that was released by Elektra Records. She also began to record more jazz, which became the style for many of her 1990s albums.

&gt; Drug-related and romantic problems interfered with her career, but James managed to maintain a career throughout the latter half of the twentieth century. Later in life, she struggled with obesity. She reached nearly twenty-nine stones, experienced mobility and knee problems, and often needed a wheelchair. In 2003, she underwent gastric bypass surgery and lost over fourteen stones.

&gt; She died on 20th January 2012.

&gt; Buckethead (Brian Carroll) is an American musician, songwriter and guitar virtuoso, famed for his distinctive stage outfit and elaborate stage shows. He has released over 280 solo studio albums and performed on over 70 more since 1992. He has also made guest appearances on more than 40 different albums by various artists. His music spans such diverse areas as heavy metal, funk, ambient, jazz, electronic, and avant-garde music.

&gt; When performing in his theatrical persona, Buckethead used to wear a KFC bucket (emblazoned with an orange bumper sticker that read “FUNERAL” in black block letters) on his head and a plain white costume mask (commonly found in costume shops and used primarily for dramatic theater productions). More recently, he has switched to a plain white bucket no longer bearing the KFC logo. He also incorporates nunchaku, robot dancing, and toy trading into his stage performances. Buckethead’s persona represents a character who was “raised by chickens” and has made it his “mission in life to alert the world to the ongoing chicken holocaust in fast-food joints around the globe.”

&gt; Although a multi-instrumentalist, Buckethead is best known for his electric guitar playing. He has been voted number 8 on a list in GuitarOne magazine of the “Top 20 Greatest Guitar Shredders of All Time.”

&gt; Buckethead performs primarily as a solo artist. He has collaborated with a wide variety of high profile artists such as Les Claypool, Tony Williams, Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell, Iggy Pop, Serj Tankian, Guns N’ Roses, Saul Williams, Mike Patton, Viggo Mortensen, and with Bill Laswell in Praxis. Buckethead has also written and performed music for major motion pictures, including: Saw II, Ghosts of Mars, Beverly Hills Ninja, Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and Last Action Hero.

&gt; Iced Earth is an American power metal band that combine heavy metal and speed metal/thrash metal genres in their music. The band was formed by Jon Schaffer, the lead songwriter and rhythm guitarist, in Tampa, Florida in 1984. The original name of the band was Purgatory but was then changed to Iced Earth.

&gt; Iced Earth’s music is often described as the style of Iron Maiden combined with 80’s thrash metal. The most distinctive element of the band’s sound is the stuttering right-hand gallop of rhythm guitarist Jon Schaffer, which sounds something like the ‘eighth-note, two-sixteenth-notes’ gallop made famous by Iron Maiden’s bass player/songwriter Steve Harris (in such songs as “Run to the Hills”, “The Trooper”, and “Caught Somewhere in Time”), varied rhythmically. Overtop of this gallop are typically laid strong melodic hooks, sometimes doubled by two guitars playing in harmony. The vocals are often high-pitched, but express a full range, while the rhythm section uses thrash and power metal techniques such as double-bass-drumming to keep the speed and energy high. Iced Earth’s drummer is known for his frequent use of drags and flams on the bass drum.

&gt; Today, Jon is the only original member in the band, having changed multiple guitarists, drummers, and vocalists. The two most recognized vocalists of the band are Matt Barlow and Tim Ripper Owens, the former vocalist of Judas Priest. Matt Barlow ended up marrying Jon's sister, making Matt the brother-in-law of Jon Schaffer.

&gt; Iced Earth lyrics tend to deal with theological issues such as punishment and sin, destiny, heaven and hell, the Antichrist and the apocalypse. Many of the band’s recent albums have been concept albums written around a theme, e.g. the antihero Spawn (The Dark Saga), horror movies (Horror Show), historical wars (The Glorious Burden) and the double concept about the anti-christ (Something Wicked).

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/48f47f473681db05f04331d9d62f9d46.png)  

&gt; Ennio Morricone born 10 November 1928 in Rome  is an Italian composer especially noted for his film scores. He has composed the scores of more than 500 motion pictures and television series, in a career lasting over 50 years. His scores have been included in over 30 award-winning films as well as several symphonic and choral pieces. Morricone is most famous for his work in the spaghetti westerns directed by his friend Sergio Leone. Morricone's sparse style of composition for the genre is particularly exemplified by the soundtracks of the classic spaghetti westerns The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Sergio Leone, 1966) and Once Upon a Time in the West (Sergio Leone, 1968).

&gt; Born in Rome, Morricone took up the trumpet as a child and attended the National Academy of Santa Cecilia to take lessons on the instrument at the age of nine. He formally entered a conservatory at the age of 12, enrolling in a four-year harmony programme. He received his trumpet diploma in 1946 and started working professionally, composing the music to ""Il Mattino"" (""The Morning""). Morricone soon gained popularity by writing his first background music for radio dramas and quickly moved into film.
In the 1950s he received the ""Diploma in Instrumentation for Band"" (fanfare) where he won a diploma in Composition under the composer Goffredo Petrassi. In 1955, Morricone started to ghost write and arrange music for other, already established film composers. Morricone soon came to the attention of his former school friend Sergio Leone, who hired Morricone to compose the music to some of his best known films. Together they created a distinctive score to accompany Leone's different version of the Western, A Fistful of Dollars.

&gt; He received his first Nastro d'Argento in 1970 for the music in Metti, una Sera a Cena (Giuseppe Patroni Griffi, 1969) and his second only a year later for Sacco and Vanzetti (Guiliano Montaldo, 1971). He received his first nomination for an Academy Award in 1979 for the score to Days of Heaven (Terrence Malick, 1978) and another in 1986 for The Mission, 1987 for The Untouchables (Brian De Palma, 1987), 1991 for Bugsy (Barry Levinson, 1991) and 2001 for Malèna (Giuseppe Tornatore, 2000).

&gt; In 2003 he scored the Japanese Taiga drama about Miyamoto Musashi, Japan's legendary warrior. In 2005 he was on a world tour with the Roma Sinfonietta Orchestra, touring from cities like New York, Bilbao, Bratislava and Tokyo. In 2006, Morricone collaborated with Morrissey by composing the string part for his song ""Dear God Please Help Me"", recorded in Rome's Forum Music Village Studios. In recognition of his vast body of work and dedication, Morricone received an honorary Academy Award in 2007; Morricone had received nominations for Best Original Score in the past, but had failed to win.

&gt; Medeski Martin &amp; Wood and John Scofield have collaborated on two albums to date, Scofield's A Go Go and the more recent Out Louder. You can find them with several names, here at Last.fm: Medeski Scofield Martin and Wood and Billy Martin, Chris Wood, John Medeski &amp; John Scofield are some variations possible.
The band received some of their first significant exposure outside of the New York City jazz scene by performing with Phish at their October 14, 1995 concert, which led to the association of the group as a jam band.
In addition, their performance on John Scofield's 1997 album A Go Go helped to further their exposure. The band collaborated further with Scofield again in 2006, releasing the album Out Louder under the name Medeski Scofield Martin &amp; Wood. This was the first album released on MMW's own Indirecto Records.
Medeski Martin &amp; Wood's first performances together were at the Village Gate, a popular New York jazz club. They were initially an acoustic jazz trio, but Medeski added a Hammond organ when the difficulties of touring with a piano became apparent. 
Their first album, Notes from the Underground, is a record of their entirely-acoustic era. All of their subsequent albums reveal Medeski's use of a wide variety of keyboards, including mellotron, melodica, and a clavinet. Wood entirely eschewed the electric bass for MMW's first three albums, and still relies heavily on the acoustic upright bass in recordings and during live performances. Their earlier albums reveal a Hip Hop influenced updating of classic soul jazz sounds, which is the primary theme of their well-known 1996 album, Shack-man.
From 1998 to 2005, MMW were signed to leading jazz label Blue Note Records, and showed them delving deeper into dense, electronic funk than their earlier albums, although the band continued to experiment with free jazz and free improvisation both on their albums and in concert. In 2001 MMW performed several songs for the Red Hot Organization's compilation album Red Hot + Indigo, a tribute to Duke Ellington, which raised money for various charities devoted to increasing AIDS awareness and fighting the disease.
Medeski Martin &amp; Wood's live performances are renowned for their exploratory nature. Their concerts usually involve extended improvisations, which may be both arrhythmic and atonal, an aspect of their musicianship that is rarely documented in the studio. They occasionally tour using only acoustic instruments, reverting to the instrumentation that they began their career with. Their album Tonic is an example of these more contemporary acoustic performances. They have also done short tours of entirely improvisatory performances. These shows usually consisted of two sets of improvisation, followed by an encore of a song from an album. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Era Istrefi (born 4 July 1995), sometimes known as simply Era (stylized as ERA), is an Albanian Kosovar singer and songwriter. She rose to fame after releasing her debut single ""Mani për money"" in 2013, which gained a positive feedback and attention from the public. Her following songs ""A po don"" and ""E dehun"", gained the same success. In June 2014, she won three Videofest awards for her music videos, including ""Best New Artist"" for her work in 2013.

&gt; In 2015 Era gained success with her song ""Njo si ti"" with over a million views on YouTube in a week. Her first duo featuring well-known Kosovo rapper Ledri Vula, ""Shumë pis"", became a summer hit.

&gt; In January 2016, Istrefi began achieving international attention due to the release of her single ""BonBon"", which drew comparisons to the work of Sia and Rihanna. Following the single's success, she was signed to American record labels Sony Music Entertainment, RCA Records, and Ultra Music in February 2016. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; TRAAMS formed in summer 2011 in the most unsuspectingly quaint surroundings of Chichester, West Sussex. They wrote one huge thunderous song during their first rehearsal that made spires quiver and cobbles wobble, and so Stu, Adam and Leigh decided to do this again every week. It seemed like a more productive pastime than how they first met, at the club night frontman Stu used to run, in what must have been the most exciting place in their hometown at that moment.

The tracks on this page, most of which are live studio recordings are free to download, are and are all previously unreleased and unheard.

&gt; The Beach Boys are an iconic American rock band, frequently cited as one of the most influential and commercially successful groups in the history of popular music due to their intricate vocal harmonies, studio experiments, and novel approaches to pop songwriting. Rooted in doo-wop and rock and roll, their early string of vocal surf hits defined the '60s California Sound. For a period afterward, they notably delved into progressive pop styles. often combining elements from classical and jazz in innovative ways. 

&gt; Formed in Hawthorne, California in 1961, the original group comprised singer-musician-composer and bandleader Brian Wilson, his brothers Carl Wilson and Dennis Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Wilson neighbor David Marks appeared on their first four albums and was a member from 1962 to 1963 as a temporary replacement for Jardine, who had left the group to pursue a career in dentistry.

&gt; On their first few studio albums, the group primarily played surf music, but this changed after 1964 as their songs became more sophisticated and autobiographical. The 1965 album Today! particularly represented this shift in sound. Bruce Johnston joined the group that same year. Session drummer Hal Blaine is quoted: ""We all studied in conservatories; we were trained musicians. We thought it was a fluke at first, but then we realized Brian was writing these incredible songs. This was not just a young kid writing about high school and surfing.""

&gt; Following their most esteemed work, Pet Sounds (1966), the band became symbols of psychedelic counterculture. The highly anticipated follow-up, Smile, was left unfinished, and Brian soon relinquished his creative hold on the group. A trilogy of lo-fi releases followed: Smiley Smile (1967), Wild Honey (1967), and Friends (1968). Brian would not be credited as a primary composer for any Beach Boys album until 1977's Love You, an album on the fringe of synth-pop, new wave, and punk.

&gt; In Brian's absence, the Beach Boys still managed to release music that was regarded favorably by fans and critics despite poor sales: Sunflower (1970) and  Surf's Up (1971). South African musicians Blondie Chaplin  and Ricky Fataar played and sang with the band on the next two albums: Carl &amp; the Passions - So Tough (1972), and Holland (1973).

&gt; Many changes in both musical style and personnel have occurred in their sometimes-stormy career: Brian Wilson's mental illness and drug addiction; the deaths of Dennis Wilson in 1983 and Carl Wilson in 1998; and continuing legal battles among surviving members of the group. With the release of 1974's Endless Summer they became a more popular touring act, playing their greatest hits. They have recorded 36 Billboard Top 40 hits (including four number-one singles), have had over 100 million sales, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.

&gt; Jessica Lea Mayfield (born on August 27, 1989, in Kent, Ohio) is an American singer-songwriter. She first performed with her family bluegrass band One Way Rider at the age of 8. At age 15, Mayfield recorded her first EP White Lies in her brother's bedroom, printing only 100 copies. One of those copies fell into the hands of Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys. After an introduction, Mayfield and Auerbach hit the studio. A featured vocalist on The Black Keys' Attack and Release, Dan Auerbach returned the favor by producing Mayfield's first studio album, recorded over the course of two years in his home studio.

&gt; Delving into country, folk and soul, With Blasphemy, So Heartfelt is a collaborative project on which Mayfield's sultry voice adds flair to edgy lyrics and melodies. With the help of her brother, bassist David Mayfield, Jessica Lea Mayfield's debut includes cameo appearances by Dr. Dog's Scott McMicken and Frank McElroy on backing vocals.

25549,"Lamb of god is a groove metal band which is an offshoot of thrash metal that's slower. Think pantera. Nu-metal is a term for bands that incorporate sounds of metal, hip hop and electronic styles of music. It's mostly a derogatory term in the metal community because a lot of nu metal bands aren't truly considered metal (which is kind of true because it is a fusion genre not a pure metal genre) and because a lot of nu metal bands are just awful. I'd consider SOAD alternative metal because they draw pretty heavily from metal sounds and tones while using a lot of alternative rock approaches when it comes to songwriting. ",Music

&gt; The Butterfly Effect were a hard rock band from Brisbane, Australia, formed in 1999. Since February 2002 the band has toured Australia and Europe extensively, and have performed over 800 times both locally and overseas as a headlining act. The band have performed at all major rock festivals in Australia including Big Day Out, Homebake, Livid and Falls Festival.

&gt; Their first EP, The Butterfly Effect (EP), was released in 2001, and charted well on the ARIA Independent charts. This first release, featuring the Triple J single ""Take Me Away"", was more ""nu-metal"" than later recordings although contained much of what was to become their signature soundscapes. They followed this with the critically-acclaimed Begins Here, released on 3 August 2003. The album peaked at No. 23 in Australia, reaching gold sales accreditation by mid-2006. It produced the minor hit Always, and attracted considerable critical acclaim

&gt; On 17 June 2006, the album Imago was released, with a move towards progressive rock and a less heavy sound. It was produced in Los Angeles by Joe Barresi, who had just produced Tool's ""10,000 Days"" album. The album was commercially successful, being featured on national radio station Triple J, peaking at No. 2 in Australia in its first week and attaining gold sales accreditation just nine weeks later. The single A Slow Descent also peaked at No. 9 on the singles charts.

&gt; Their next album, Final Conversation of Kings, was released on 20 September 2008. It was produced by Forrester Savill on the Central Coast of New South Wales, and represented a significant change in their sound, but did not match either the commercial or critical success of previous releases despite charting at No.3 in its first week in Australia.

&gt; On 6 February 2012, the band announced on Facebook the following message:

&gt; The Butterfly Effect wish to inform their fans and media that singer Clint Boge is officially leaving the band to pursue other musical interests. The remaining members of the band, Ben Hall, Kurt Goedhart and Glenn Esmond will continue to work together and will announce their intentions in the not too distant future.

&gt; Clint’s departure is an amicable one and the band are giving fans a chance to see them perform together for the last time on the club circuit by announcing the “EFFECTED” national tour starting late April 2012. To celebrate 10 years of recordings The Butterfly Effect is releasing an “EFFECTED” compilation CD of their best work in April and signed copies will be available at shows on the tour.""

&gt; In late 2013, the band introduced new singer Paul Galagher with the release of a single, ""Eyes Down"", and a small tour. However, the band soon became inactive, and in 2016, it was announced that they had permanently disbanded. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Starset is an American alternative rock band from Columbus, OH formed by Dustin Bates, lead vocalist of Downplay.
The band released their debut album ""Transmissions"" on July 8, 2014 on Razor and Tie label. For the first week album sold more than 5,300 copies.  The album debuted at #49 in the Billboard 200. In addition to the Billboard 200 album hit in other charts. In the category ""Hard Music"" album debuted #5, ""Rock"" #15 and a ""Digital"" #24.

&gt; In the early hours of New Years Day 2013, a radio astronomer at the Allen Telescope Array in northern California discovered a mysterious signal emanating from a star within the Ophiuchus Constellation. 

&gt; Contained within the signal was a Message--of human origin--foretelling the details of man's imminent demise. The Message was brought to The Starset Society, who quickly realized the importance of its immediate publication. 

&gt; Risking extreme danger, The Starset Society commissioned a group of musicians and scientists to assist them in spreading the knowledge to a broader audience. This group became known simply as STARSET.

&gt; William Onyeabor (Enugu, Nigeria, 29 March 1946 – 16 January 2017) was a Nigerian afro-funk, musician, singer and songwriter.

&gt; Onyeabor's songs are often heavily rhythmic and synthesized, occasionally epic in scope, with lyrics decrying war and sung by both Onyeabor himself and female backing vocalists. In recent years a number of his songs have appeared on various compilations, most often his biggest hit, ""Better Change Your Mind"", which has appeared on Africa 100, World Psychedelic Classics 3: Love's a Real Thing - The Funky Fuzzy Sounds of West Africa, and Nigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970's Funky Lagos, through labels such as Luaka Bop.

&gt; Some biographies claim that he studied cinematography in Russia, returning to Nigeria in the 1970s to start his own Wilfilms music label and to set up a recording and production studio. He was later crowned a High Chief in Enugu, where he still lives as a businessman working on government contracts and running his own flour mill. According to the Luaka Bop record label, Onyeabor ""self-released eight albums between 1977 and 1985 and then became a born-again Christian, refusing to ever speak about himself or his music again."" The label reports that through attempting to speak with Onyeabor himself, and by talking to people who seem to have firsthand knowledge, it has been trying to construct an accurate biography of him for the past 18 months, without success.

&gt; In 2014, the music website Noisey, affiliated to Vice magazine, released a 31-minute documentary entitled Fantastic Man that documents Onyeabor's history and legacy as well as Noisey's attempt to track him down for an interview. 2014 also saw a touring supergroup called the Atomic Bomb! Band come together to play Onyeabor's music at a series of concerts and festivals around the world. The group includes David Byrne (of Talking Heads) and Money Mark (of the Beastie Boys).

&gt; In December 2014, William Onyeabor made his first radio appearance on the Lauren Laverne Show on BBC 6 Music, where he stated ""I only create music that will help the world,"" whilst also admitting that he has never played live, and announcing that he had plans to release new material.

&gt; William Onyeabor died aged 72, peacefully, on January 16, 2017.

&gt; Boards of Canada are an electronic music duo from Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, formed in 1985 and comprised of brothers Mike Sandison (born 1 June 1970) and Marcus Eoin (born 21 July 1971). They have released a number of works, most notably the studio albums Music Has the Right to Children (1998), Geogaddi (2002), and The Campfire Headphase (2005) on the pioneering electronic music label Warp. Their fourth album Tomorrow's Harvest was released in June 2013.

&gt; Boards of Canada have had an enormous influence on the ambient, downtempo and IDM scenes. They have frequently made reference to the warm, scratchy, artificial sounds of 1970s television. Indeed, the Sandison brothers admit to being inspired by the documentary films of the National Film Board of Canada, from which they take their name. The duo have recorded a few minor works under the name Hell Interface. Boards of Canada’s music has been used in several CSI episodes and on Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim interlude shorts; small bits of their music have been used on the BBC program Top Gear for transitional music.

&gt; Early Boards of Canada (1970s-1995)

&gt; Growing up in a musical family, brothers Mike Sandison and Marcus Eoin began playing instruments at a young age. They experimented with recording techniques at around the age of 10, using tape machines to layer cut-up samples of found sounds over compositions of their own. In their teens they participated in a number of amateur bands, however, it wasn't until 1986 when Marcus was invited to Mike’s band that Boards of Canada was born.

&gt; By 1989, the band had been reduced to Sandison, Eoin and Christopher Horne. In the early 1990s, a number of collaborations took place and the band put on small, fairly regular shows among the “Hexagon Sun” collective.

&gt; In early 2000, the official website for the band, Music70.com (now boardsofcanada.com) removed the early discography of Boards of Canada, although some information has been preserved by fans. Early tape releases by Boards of Canada include ""Play by Numbers"", ""Acid Memories"", ""Hooper Bay"", and the earliest known release by the band is titled ""Catalog 3"". None of the material from those days is readily available, and since official Boards of Canada sources ignore the existence of this material, there seems to be little chance for this early material to ever resurface.

&gt; Boards of Canada from Twoism (1995-present)

&gt; In 1995, the band released the first work from the Hexagon Sun studio, the EP ""Twoism"". Like earlier Music70 releases, it was produced in a self-financed limited run and was privately distributed, primarily to friends and labels. Unlike previous releases though, a small number of copies were also released to the public through the IDM mailing list. Though not a widespread commercial release, it was considered of such high quality to be subsequently re-pressed in 2002 and serves as a demarcation point into more professional releases.

&gt; The precursor to ""Music Has the Right to Children"" was released in 1996. Titled ""Boc Maxima"", it was a semi-private release that is notable for being a full-length album. Boc Maxima’s work was later used for ""Music Has the Right to Children"", with which it shares many tracks.

&gt; Boards of Canada’s first commercial release occurred after attracting the attention of Autechre’s Sean Booth of the English label Skam Records, one of many people sent a demo EP. Skam released what was considered Boards of Canada’s first ""findable"" work, ""Hi Scores"", in 1996.

&gt; ""Music Has the Right to Children"" was released in 1998. Many fans consider this record to be a masterpiece. The popularity of the record was substantial enough to start a wave of sound-alikes.

&gt; John Peel featured Boards of Canada on his BBC Radio 1 program in January of 1998. The session featured two remixes from ""Music Has the Right to Children"" — ""PlayAquarius (Version 3)"" and ""PlayOlson (Version 3)"" — along with the tracks ""Happy Cycling"" and “XYZ”. Excluding “XYZ”, the set was released on a Warp Records CD titled ""Peel Session TX 21/07/1998"".

&gt; Though never an actively touring band, Boards of Canada did perform a handful of shows. Early shows saw them supporting Warp label-mates Seefeel and Autechre in a scattering of UK dates. They also participated in a few festivals and multi-artist bills, including two Warp parties: Warp’s 10th Anniversary Party in 1999 and The Incredible Warp Lighthouse Party almost one year later. They made their most prominent showing in 2001 as one of the headliners at the Tortoise-curated All Tomorrow’s Parties festival. They have not performed a live show since.

&gt; Boards of Canada released a four-track EP, ""In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country"", in November 2000, their first original release in two years.

&gt; The full-length album ""Geogaddi"" was released in 2002. It was described by Sandison as ”a record for some sort of trial-by-fire, a claustrophobic, twisting journey that takes you into some pretty dark experiences before you reach the open air again.”

&gt; Throughout most of their career, Mike and Marcus chose not to publicize their brotherhood and were simply portrayed as childhood friends. Their kinship was finally revealed in a 2005 Pitchfork interview. Mike explained that they concealed the fact to avoid comparisons to Orbital, another well-known UK electronic group composed of two brothers.

&gt; Their third album for Warp Records, ""The Campfire Headphase"", was released on 17 October 2005. The album covers much of the same musical territory as their previous works and featured fifteen tracks, including “Peacock Tail”, “Chromakey Dreamcoat”, and “Dayvan Cowboy”. Two versions of “Dayvan Cowboy” — the original and a remix by Odd Nosdam — are on the six-track EP, ""Trans Canada Highway"", which was released on 26 May 2006.

&gt; Sound and methods

&gt; Brief songs or “vignettes” feature prominently in their music. Such songs are often weaving melodies or speech accompanied by atmospherics to capture a specific moment or mood. They often last less than two minutes, but, as Sandison says, “those short tracks you mention, we write far more of those than the so-called ‘full on’ tracks, and in a way, they are our own favorites”.

&gt; Boards of Canada have written an enormous number of song fragments and songs, most of which will never be released. It does not appear that music is made exclusively for commercial release. Rather, albums seem to be the result of selecting complementary songs from current work, which is a compositional technique shared by many electronic or experimental artists such as Nightmares on Wax, Canabrism and King Crimson. Geogaddi’s development involved the creation of 400 song fragments and 64 complete songs, of which 23 were selected, one of which is silence.

&gt; Subliminal messages, symbolism, and religion

&gt; Marcus and Mike have both expressed a strong interest in the power of subliminal messaging and their work is full of cryptic messages.

&gt; Some critics refuse to listen to their music on account that they are positive the band is trying to brainwash their listeners for unknown motivations, citing references to David Koresh and occult symbols as proof. Others approach these facts from the skeptical angle, saying it is nothing but a bunch of “cute tricks” and an ironic gesture towards people who take such things seriously (and some would say, as a bit of a similar gesture towards their own body of work in later releases, such as ""Geogaddi"").

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/9cc50f697bcc4737919865392afd4a09.png)  

&gt; David Jon Gilmour, known as David Gilmour (born 6 March 1946 in Cambridge, England, United Kingdom) is an English musician and multi-instrumentalist, who was the guitarist, lead vocalist and one of the songwriters of the progressive rock band Pink Floyd.

&gt; Gilmour was born in Cambridge, England. His father, Douglas Gilmour, was a senior lecturer in zoology at the University of Cambridge and his mother, Sylvia (née Wilson), was a teacher and film editor who raised her family at Grantchester Meadows, later immortalised by a Roger Waters song on Pink Floyd's Ummagumma. Gilmour and his siblings were encouraged by their parents in their musical abilities. Gilmour has a younger brother, Peter, who has been a guitarist for a slightly longer time than Gilmour. Gilmour attended The Perse School on Hills Road, Cambridge, which he ""didn't enjoy"" but where he met future Pink Floyd guitarist and vocalist Syd Barrett, along with bassist and vocalist Roger Waters who attended Cambridgeshire High School for Boys, also situated on Hills Road. In 1954, Gilmour bought his first single, Bill Haley's ""Rock Around the Clock"". At age 13, Gilmour was given his first guitar, a Tatay, by his neighbour, Gilmour started learning how to play using a book and record set by Pete Seeger.

&gt; In September 1962, he studied modern languages to A-Level and, along with Syd Barrett, went to Cambridge Technical College. Despite not finishing the languages course, Gilmour would eventually become a fluent French speaker. Gilmour and Barrett spent their lunchtime practising guitar together, Barrett would often refer to Gilmour as ""Fred"". They were not yet bandmates, however, and Gilmour started playing in the band Jokers Wild in 1962, which Gilmour left in 1967.

&gt; Gilmour joined Pink Floyd in 1968, when he was asked to replace former front man and guitarist Syd Barrett.  Barrett was becoming increasingly difficult to work with (due to his deteriorating mental state), so Gilmour stepped in to fill the void. Gilmour's contributions helped to define what would become known as the ""Pink Floyd"" sound. With Roger Waters, Gilmour co-wrote many of Pink Floyd's classic songs, including ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond""(Itself about Syd), ""Wish You Were Here"" (about Roger's father) , ""Time"", ""Dogs"", ""Echoes"", ""Comfortably Numb"", and ""Run Like Hell"".  When Waters left the band in 1984 to pursue a solo career, Gilmour took over Pink Floyd as leader, and they released two more albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987), and The Division Bell (1994).  Both albums performed very well, proving that the Pink Floyd name was stronger than any individual member.  On July 2, 2005, David Gilmour and Roger Waters briefly set aside their differences and performed as Pink Floyd for one final performance at Live 8.  The reunion was the most talked about event of the day, and sales of Pink Floyd's back catalogue shot through the roof.  Rumours of a full scale tour began to surface shortly after the show, with both Gilmour and Waters being offered millions of dollars, but it wasn't meant to be.  Neither Waters nor Gilmour showed much enthusiasm to work together again, with Gilmour being quoted as saying that he would rather spend his time pursuing his solo career.

&gt; Much to everyone's surprise, Gilmour and Waters reunited once again on July 11, 2010 for a charity performance for ""The Hoping Foundation,"" an organization that supports Palestinian refugee kids.  At Ronnie Scott's club in London, the duo performed four songs together: ""To Know Him is to Love Him"" (a cover of the old Teddy Bear's song), ""Wish You Were Here,"" ""Comfortably Numb,"" and finally (after a special request) ""Another Brick in the Wall Part 2.""  Once again, just like after the Live 8 Reunion, speculation began regarding future reunions.  No official Pink Floyd reunion has yet been set, but Gilmour did promise that he would join Roger Waters for one show on his 2010-11 ""The Wall"" tour, performing ""Comfortably Numb.""  The show that Gilmour is set to play is being kept a secret to surprise fans and (most likely) to prevent scalpers from selling tickets at outrageous prices.

&gt; The door now seems slightly ajar that David Gilmour and Roger Waters may possibly work with each other again, either as a duo, or as Pink Floyd once again.  On Roger Waters facebook page, he wrote: ""We (played together), and it was fucking great!  End of story.  Or possibly beginning.""

&gt; As a solo artist, David Gilmour has released 3 studio albums; David Gilmour (1978), About Face (1984), and On an Island (2006). In September 2008, he released his first live album Live In Gdansk , a recording of a concert he and his band performed in Gdansk Shipyard during his 2006 On An Island tour. In addition, he has two live DVDs - 2002's mostly acoustic ""In Concert"" and 2007's Remember That Night.  Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Sade (pronounced ""shah-day"") is a Grammy-winning British smooth jazz band named after their lead singer Sade Adu. The band's music features elements of jazz, funk, soul and rnb. 

&gt; Sade was formed in 1982, when members of a Latino-soul band Pride — Sade Adu, (real name Helen Folasade Adu - born 16 January 1959 in Ibadan, Nigeria) Stuart Matthewman and Paul Spencer Denman — together with Paul Cook formed a splinter group and began to write their own material. Sade made their debut in December 1982 at Ronnie Scott's Club in London, England, in support of Pride. Later, in 1983, Andrew Hale joined Sade. In 1984 Paul Cook left the band.

&gt; Sade Adu, the band's singer, is the daughter of a Nigerian father and an English mother. After her mother returned to England, Sade grew up on the North End of London. Developing a good singing voice in her teens, Sade worked part-time jobs in and outside of the music business. She listened to Ray Charles, Nina Simone, Al Green, Aretha Franklin, and Billie Holliday. Sade studied fashion design at St. Martin’s School of Art in London while also doing some modeling on the side.

&gt; Around 1980, Adu started singing harmony with a Latin funk group called Arriva. One of the more popular numbers that the group would perform was a Sade original co-written with bandmember Ray St. John, “Smooth Operator,” that would later become Sade’s first stateside hit. The following year Adu joined the eight-piece funk band Pride as a background singer. The band included future Sade band members guitarist/saxophonist Stuart Matthewman (a key player in ’90s urban soul singer Maxwell’s success) and bassist Paul Denman. The concept of the group was that there could shoot-offs. In essence, a few members within the main group Pride formed mini-groups that would be the opening act. Pride did a lot of shows around London, stirring up record company interest. Initially, the labels wanted to only sign Adu, while the group members wanted a deal for the whole band. After a year, the other band members told Adu, Matthewman, and Denman to go ahead and sign a deal. Adding keyboardist Andrew Hale, the group signed to the U.K. division of Epic Records.

&gt; In May 1983, Sade performed at Danceteria Club in New York, NY, United States. It was the first US Sade show. They received more attention from the media and record companies and separated finally. On 18 October 1983 Sade Adu signed with Epic Records. The rest of the band signed in 1984. All Sade albums were released through this label.

&gt; Their debut album, Diamond Life (with overall production by Robin Millar), went Top Ten in the U.K. in late 1984. January 1985 saw the album released on CBS’ Portrait label and by spring it went platinum off the strength of the Top Ten singles “Smooth Operator” and “Hang on to Your Love.” The second album, Promise (November 1985), featured “Never As Good As the First Time” and arguably her signature song, “The Sweetest Taboo,” which stayed on the U.S. pop charts for six months. Sade was so popular that some radio stations reinstated the ’70s practice of playing album tracks, adding “Is It a Crime” and “Tar Baby” to their play lists. In 1986, Sade won a Grammy for Best New Artist.

&gt; Sade’s third album was 1988’s Stronger Than Pride and featured their first number one soul single “Paradise,” “Nothing Can Come Between Us,” and “Keep Looking.” A new Sade album didn’t appear for four years. 1992’s Love Deluxe continued the unbroken streak of multi-platinum Sade albums, spinning off the hits “No Ordinary Love,” “Feel No Pain,” and “Pearls.” While the album’s producer Mike Pela, Matthewman, Denman, and Hale have gone on to other projects. The new millennium did spark a new scene for Sade. She issued Lovers Rock in fall 2000 and incoporated more mainstream elements than ever before. Debut single “By Your Side” was also a hit among radio and adult-contemporary listerners. The following summer, Sade embarked on their first tour in more than a decade, selling out countless dates across America. In early 2002, Sade celebrated their success of the tour by releasing their first ever live album and DVD, Lovers Live.

&gt; Sade made a great contribution to development of modern music. They dismantled many of the old music business ways and quite promptly became a fully functioning autonomous unit with a firm grip on every aspect of the recording process.

&gt; Sade is first and foremost a live act. Sade Adu said in one of her interviews: ""When we play I know that the people love the music. I can feel it."" Throughout their history, Sade have always attracted a diverse, multi-racial audience who are drawn by the band's open-minded approach to music. ""And that's the best thing we've achieved.""

&gt; Soldier of Love, Sade's first official studio album since the multi-platinum release of Lovers Rock in 2000, was released on 8th February, 2010. 

&gt; Sade is also two piece stoner rock from Prague, Czech republic. Released one MC. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Sir Elton Hercules John, CBE (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight in Pinner, Middlesex, England on 25 March 1947) is an immensely popular English singer, composer (mostly with lyricist Bernie Taupin) and pianist. In a career spanning five decades, Elton John has sold over 250 million records and has over fifty Top 40 hits, making him one of the most successful musicians of all time. His 1997 tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales, "" Candle In The Wind 1997,"" remains the world's biggest selling and fastest selling single of all time.

&gt; In 1964, Dwight and his friends formed a band called Bluesology. By day, he ran errands for a music publishing company; he divided his nights between solo gigs at a London hotel bar and working with Bluesology. By the mid-1960s, Bluesology was backing touring American soul and R&amp;B musicians like The Isley Brothers, Major Lance, Billy Stewart, Doris Troy and Patti LaBelle and The Bluebelles. In 1966, the band became musician Long John Baldry's supporting band and played 16 times at The Marquee Club.

&gt; John was one of the dominant commercial forces in the rock world during the 1970s, with a string of seven consecutive #1 records on the U.S. album charts, twenty-three Top 40 singles, sixty Top 10 hits, and six #1 hits. His success had a profound impact on popular music, and contributed to the continued popularity of the piano in rock and roll. 

&gt; Key musical elements in John's success included his melodic gifts matched with the contributions of his lyricist partner Bernie Taupin, his rich tenor and gospel-chorded piano, aggressive string arrangements, his flamboyant fashion sense and on-stage showmanship. As told by himself, his somewhat ""flashy"" outfits were due to the fact that he sits behind the piano and would otherwise vanish on stage.

&gt; John was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and knighted in 1998.  He has helped lead the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s.  In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked John #49 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.  He continues to be a major public figure. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Peter Gabriel (born Peter Brian Gabriel on 13 February 1950) is an internationally-famous award-winning English singer, musician, and songwriter who rose to fame as the lead vocalist and flautist of the progressive rock band Genesis. After leaving Genesis, Gabriel went on to a successful solo career. His 1986 album, So, is his most commercially successful, and the album's biggest hit, ""Sledgehammer"", won a record nine at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards. Throughout his career Gabriel has won numerous music awards, including three Brit Awards (winning Best British Male in 1987), six Grammy Awards, and thirteen MTV Video Music Awards. In 2007 he was honoured as a BMI Icon at the 57th annual BMI London Awards for his “influence on generations of music makers”. In 2009 he was awarded the Polar Music Prize and, in 2010, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis.

&gt; Gabriel founded Genesis in 1967 with fellow Charterhouse School pupils Tony Banks, Anthony Phillips, Mike Rutherford, and drummer Chris Stewart. After leaving Genesis, Gabriel began to experiment with various elements of world music as the underpinning for his dense, poetic lyrics. Although he released a series of successful song-oriented albums, Peter Gabriel 1, 2, 3, and 4 (aka Car, Scratch, Melt, and Security) and chart success in the UK with the top 5 single Games Without Frontiers his commercially strongest period began in 1986 with his now seminal album So and its slightly less successful counterpart Us. After this came a 10 year hiatus until the album Up came out.  This was followed by the ground breaking Growing Up tour. There was a DVD released of this tour.  His 2010 studio album is Scratch My Back. 

&gt; Gabriel has composed and recorded soundtracks for films as diverse as Birdy (which contained re-purposed snippets of his studio albums to date), Passion: Music from The Last Temptation of Christ, and Rabbit Proof Fence. He also sang the Randy Newman composed title song to Babe: Pig in the City called That'll Do. He recently contributed to the wall-e soundtrack, singing the end title song Down to Earth, and composing two other tracks.

&gt; He created one of the more innovative videos of its time for the song Sledgehammer, with the then-fledgling Aardman Animations studio.

&gt; He was also instrumental in founding the long-running festival organization WOMAD (World Of Music Art and Dance), and participated in the UK millennium celebration, for which he wrote the musical OVO. The recording studio he built, Real World, and the record label it spawned, have brought many artists from around the world to the attention of Western ears.

&gt; Gabriel also wrote the music for The Millennium Show which was performed throughout the year 2000 in The Millennium Dome.  The arena where The Millennium Show was performed is now the O2 Arena.

&gt; Rumors of reunion with his former band Genesis have persisted, with conflicting information that changes almost daily, although he has confirmed he will not play a part in Genesis' reunion tour. [note: the reunion WAS in rehearsals when Gabriel decided not to do it because he felt like he wasn't having enough input.] Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; William DeVaughn (b 1948, Washington D.C.) is an American R&amp;B singer, songwriter and guitarist, best known for the hit song ""Be Thankful for What You Got"".
DeVaughn was a salaried government employee as a drafting technician (according to Casey Kasem,[citation needed] he designed sewers), part-time singer,[1] and member of the Jehovah's Witnesses.[citation needed] He wrote ""[ ""[ A Cadillac Don`t Come Easy eventually re-written to become""Be Thankful for What You Got ""(song)|in 1972, and spent $900 toward its development to Omega Sound [A Philadelphia Production House][2] The producers at Omega [Frank Fioravanti and John Davis wanted to go for a nasty groove and wrote an smooth arrangement ,eventually booking time to record at the famous Sigma Sound Studio in Philadelphia Remarkably, the session featured members of the MFSB group - guitarist Norman Harris, drummer Earl Young, bassist Ron Baker, and vibist Vince Montana - these top musicians were secured by Allan Felder, who also developed the separate adlib back -up chorus with his Sister`s vocal choir. .[3]Frank Fioravanti, could have released the record on the companies own label Sound Gems but it was just starting out and instead secured its release on the Roxbury Records record label..&gt;[4]
The record sold nearly two million copies on its release in spring 1974, reaching #1 on the U.S. R&amp;B charts and #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, selling a million copies.[5] With a sound and content influenced by Curtis Mayfield, its simple and encouraging lyrics hit home, to the extent that it became featured on gospel radio stations. When his success as a recording artist seemed guaranteed, DeVaughn quit his government job.
DeVaughn released an album, featuring mostly songs of an overtly religious character, and the second single, ""Blood Is Thicker Than Water"", made the R&amp;B top ten and the pop top fifty later in 1974; ""Give the Little Man a Great Big Hand"" had minor success early the next year.[6] Live, DeVaughn preached to and admonished his audience from the stage. He lost interest in the music industry not long after, working in a record store and again as a draftsman. Fioravanti kept Devaughn under contract hoping to eventually get recording again but it wasn`t until 1980 that they would hook-up for new projects. Fioravanti made a mistake by giving the new album Figures Can't Calculate' to ' (TEC Records) included the title song, which was a minor R&amp;B hit, and a remake of ""Be Thankful for What You Got"".TEC never paid out any royalties. Still though soon after Devaughn recorded another Fioravanti tune ""Creme de Creme "" released in Europe on the ""Red Bus"" label. Until this point in time Fioravanti produced or co-produced all of the singles and albums.

&gt; In 2004, DeVaughn released a new single, ""I Came Back"", on his own Mighty Two Diamond Records.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

&gt; In 2004 he released a new single, ""I Came Back"", on his own Mighty Two Diamond Records.

&gt; In that same year, rapper Ludacris sampled this song[dubious – discuss] for ""Diamond in the Back"" on his album Chicken and Beer. It uses DeVaughn's beat and his voice is used throughout the chorus. Read more on Last.fm.

Granted - these are more like story-songs than modern rap, and perhaps not spoken as rhythmically, but nevertheless, are the progenitors of rap and hip-hop.

The origin of the word ""rap"" as applied to talking in music, dates back to the early 70s. When the hip and groovy young people of the late 60s (hippies, etc.) wanted to talk, they'd say, ""Let's rap.""  They didn't mean, perform a song.  But that's the origin of the word.

29997,"Musicologist here. This is a strange and obtuse question, as generations are... fickle to say the least. I consider myself a millienial and I was born in 93, so I'm in my early twenties now, meaning the period defining pop-music artists ""for me"" are has-beens now - people like Eminem, Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, Coldplay and so on. Generally music history is treated in decades because it allows for more precise boundaries when performing comparisons of the evolutionary lines of music. I've listened to music for three decades, and they were all very different from one another, even though I belong to one generation.

As for defining artist, as in creators and/or cultural symbols of a specific subculture, I dont really see that happening in the same way that it did with earlier generations. Music seems to follow the subcultures nowadays, rather than the other way around, as it used to be. I think our current period in music history will be largely remembered by musicologist as the period where elements of electronic music finally blended with traditional instrumentation and the divide between computer generated sounds and ""real music"" is eliminated, but it's impossible to say for sure. 

Ultimately, I think the period defining artist are determined by what direction the evolution of music goes - the artists that were the inspiriation for the next musical paradigm will be the ones written about in the history. All generations have myriads of celebrities and successful artist you never heard of because they weren't significant enough to earn a place in music history.

&gt; Boston is a rock band that formed in 1974 in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. Centered on guitarist, songwriter, and producer Tom Scholz, a former product designer at Polaroid Corporation and an MIT engineering student, the band's best known works include the popular singles ""More Than a Feeling"", ""Peace of Mind"", ""Foreplay/Long Time"", ""Don't Look Back"", and ""Amanda"" among others. Their 1976 self-titled debut is the second biggest-selling debut album of all-time in the U.S., with more than 17 million copies sold. 'Third Stage' was only the second album to ever be certified triple-platinum in its first month of release, in November of 1986. The first was Lionel Richie's 'Dancing On The Ceiling', which did it one month earlier.

&gt; The group first formed in the mind of Tom Scholz, who had long expressed interest in melodic rock and the fine particulars of recording technology. Even as a child, he tinkered with just about anything mechanical or electronic that he could get his hands on. Prior to his musical career, Scholz received both a bachelor's degree, in 1969, and a master's degree, in 1970, in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He then began working for the Polaroid Corporation as a senior product design engineer. Scholz would then reside in Boston.

&gt; Creating demos in his own home, inspired by contemporary 70s progressive rock and what came to be known as ""album oriented rock"" (""aor""), Scholz attracted the interest of Epic Records, who signed Scholz to a recording contract. Vocalist Brad Delp, who was born in Peabody, Massachusetts in 1951 (Scholz is about four years older) to French-Canadian immigrants and was inspired to sing after seeing The Beatles perform on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964, served as a sort of not-so secret weapon for Scholz's project. Delp's ""golden voice"" has inspired numerous later rock artists to take up the microphone.

&gt; Scholz believed that his demos were good enough to be the released album but Epic told him to rerecord them. Most of the guitar, bass, and keyboards were performed by Scholz, although other players were involved sporadically throughout the recording of the album. Epic did not want the album recorded entirely in Scholz's home as Scholz intended (they suggested using a recording studio), but most of what ended up on the album was ultimately recorded by Scholz in his basement.

&gt; 'Boston' was first released by Epic Records on August 25, 1976. Few industry insiders thought a guitar-heavy rock record could make much of a dent in the charts as disco ruled the airwaves at the time. The album broke out of Cleveland first, and the following week it had been added at 392 stations. Scholz, then 29, still worked at Polaroid during the first few weeks of the record's success and felt wary, changing his mind when the album quickly sold 200,000 copies. Critical praise also came to the band; for example, Rolling Stone wrote that Boston's ""affinity for heavy rock &amp; roll provides a sense of dynamics that coheres magnetically with sophisticated progressive structures.""

&gt; The album was certified gold just two months after its release, and it sold another 500,000 copies within 30 days, going platinum for the first time in November 1976. With songs that became rock anthems such as the evergreen ""More Than a Feeling"", 'Boston' is the second best-selling debut album of all time in the United States, falling just short of Guns N' Roses' 'Appetite for Destruction'. Many critics have named it as one of the best American albums of all time.

&gt; With a touring unit coming together around the line-up of Barry Goudreau, Tom Scholz, Sib Hashian, Brad Delp, and Fran Sheehan, the band played to a wide variety of crowds big and small, receiving strong fan support. Feeling an essentially unbearable amount of pressure to come up with another commercial mega-hit, Scholz's still desired to experiment with his sound and had a growing sense of perfectionism. 'Don't Look Back' came out on August 2, 1978, viewed by Scholz as a hurried effort but picking up widespread success. It's been certified as multi-platinum, and its title track has become a classic rock staple.

&gt; Acrimonious fighting with label Epic Records, which soon became a long, drawn-out legal fight, left the future of the band stalled. Their next work, 'Third Stage' , came out in September 23, 1986, quite a while after their sophomore work. Bad luck and ill-will seemed to trail the group, with floods and power failures halting many studio sessions. Still, the album went to #1 on the Billboard 200, where it stayed for four weeks.

&gt; In addition, 'Third Stage' was only the second album to ever be certified triple-platinum in its first month of release, in November of 1986. As stated before, the first was Lionel Richie's 'Dancing On The Ceiling', which did it one month earlier. Nonetheless, Boston seemed to have gotten stuck.

&gt; On March 9th, 2007, Brad Delp (vocals) committed suicide at his home in Atkinson, New Hampshire.  He was 55. Delp sang all the lead and harmony vocals on Boston's first three albums. Though well known for his ""golden"" voice with soaring vocals and range, Delp was also a multi-instrumentalist, playing guitar, harmonica and keyboards. Additionally he wrote or co-wrote several songs for Boston and many other artists.  He has since been replaced with a singer from Asia who Tom Scholz's wife heard singing Boston songs and couldn't believe it wasn't actually Brad singing.

&gt; More than 10 years in the making, Boston will be coming out with a new studio album, ""Life, Love &amp; Hope"" on December 3, 2013. Founding member, Tom Scholz states, ""These are songs from the heart, each of them taking many months of effort to write, arrange, perform and record, always up to the demands of Boston's harshest critic, me. They have all been meticulously recorded to analogue tape on the same machines and equipment used for Boston's hits for the past 35 years."" 

&gt; The album will include lead vocals from Brad Delp, Tommy DeCarlo, Kimberley Dahme, David Victor, and Tom Scholz, and features tracks with the classic Boston sound, as well as the latest in the evolution of Scholz' musical artistry. ""I intentionally stayed close to the early BOSTON style on some of the songs, even using the same amps and instruments; on others I let my imagination run wild,"" says Tom.

&gt; Norman Greenbaum (born 20th November 1942, Malden, Massachusetts) is a U.S.  singer-songwriter.

&gt; He is best known for writing and performing his hit song  ""Spirit in the Sky"", which sold two million copies in 1969 and 1970. Though Greenbaum is generally regarded as a one-hit wonder; several of his records placed prominently in the charts. In 1968, under the name Dr. West's Medicine Show and Junk Band, he recorded the novelty hit ""The Eggplant That Ate Chicago"".

&gt; Greenbaum's initial interest in music was sparked by southern blues music and the folk music that was popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He performed with various bands in high school and studied music at Boston University for two years. In college he performed at local coffeehouses but eventually dropped out and moved to Los Angeles in 1965. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; C2C (also known as Coups2Cross) was born in 1998 from the meeting of 4 French Dj's: Greem, Atom, Pfel and 20Syl. Members of an emerging movement called scratch music (or turntablism), this crew keeps working on finding original sounds and knows how to benefit from its technical control to put forward some musical quality which makes its identity. Each member uses his turntable as an instrument, recreating in turn drums or bass guitars, scratching a riff of guitar or shearing the brass... to lead to a general harmony such as bands made up of instruments known as ""traditional"".

&gt; C2C has obtained in September 2006 its fourth DMC team world champion title in a row. With their previous victory in 2003, 2004 and 2005 they achieve a historical quadruple and break Dj Craze's records, the only Dj that has made it 3 times in a row until today... This crown is in fact the result of a keen upstream work: while taking part regularly in competitions, they make progress and make a clean sweep of the best ranks as they also won ITF 2005 team world Champion title and Hip Hop World Challenge title. Pfel, the last Dj getting in the crew, round off this prize list by his collection of trophies won in solo competitions (DMC, ITF). This rise leads them in parallel to perform all around the world with Q-Bert, A-Trak, Dj Kentaro, The Scratch Perverts or DJ Vadim. Exploiting at the very maximum human as well as material possibilities (mixers effects, feedback, larsens...), the show presented on tour is out of breath for the listener. The denseness of sequences is cut by technical parts meant to underline individual performances. Routines give way to live compositions mixing turntables of one, machines of another finish brilliantly with the 6 minutes sets having made them champions of the world four times in a row! 

&gt; On the creation side, the quartet excels too and particularly in realizing pieces intended for producing. Thanks to their various experiences and after a long soundgrubbing work, they launch out a whole series of breakbeats entitled Flyin' Saucer (3 volumes to date) including several own innovations. A recent proof of their qualities in this field: 20Syl and Greem, respectively Mc and DJ of the band called Hocus Pocus, invited the two others C2C Djs to take part in its new album 73 Touches (On And On records). This collaboration has just led on a track completely played with turntables. They're now working on their first album which will lead them to a further step in their artform.

&gt; Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band formed in Bolton, Greater Manchester, UK in 1976, led by singer-songwriter and guitarist Pete Shelley for nearly their entire existence.

&gt; They are commonly regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement and the punk rock, power pop, pop punk and indie rock genres in general. They are primarily remembered for their singles, a string of would-be hits that combined a strong grasp of pop song craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a ""punk masterpiece"" The widely covered ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" remains one of their best-known songs.

&gt; The name ""Buzzcocks"" partially comes from the Manchester slang term cock meaning youngster, and its use in the 1970s ITV drama serial Rock Follies which included the catch phrases ""that's the buzz, cocks"" and ""give me a buzz, cock!""

&gt; Buzzcocks were one of the key first generation British punk rock bands to form in the wake of the Sex Pistols in 1976. They were founded by Mancunians Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, however Devoto left soon after the group released their Spiral Scratch EP (on their own independent label), leaving Shelley to take over vocals. 

&gt; They are best known for their catchy, poppy punk sound, which has been widely influential, which was adopted as Peter Shelley took over on the vocals, singing about what the whole punk rock scene opted not to sing about: love. Devoto in the meanwhile formed Magazine.

&gt; They rehearsed in a friend's kitchen and played at the all-day 100 club punk ""festival"", in London. At the end of 1977 the band signed to United Artists and released ""Orgasm Addict"", with Shelley's high-pitched vocal delivery and Ramones-esque fuzz-guitar sound ensuring the controversial single would be played over again. Later came ""What Do I Get?"" which hit the UK charts and showed Shelley's brilliance in songwriting.

&gt; An LP was then released, Another Music in a Different Kitchen which came with its own carrier bag, labelled ""Product"". In 1978-79 five chart-hitting singles were released including ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" and had captured a pop-loving audience by this time. Love Bites, their second LP was released later on, which had less excitement than the last album, though it did sell well, with Steve Diggle taking over lyric-writing.

&gt; October 1979 saw A Different Kind of Tension which was panned by some critics, quite unfairly, as it contains some excellent songs, the title track being the stand-out. It perhaps suffered from being the second album to be released that year, with the record company keen to capitalise on the band's chart success at the time. 

&gt; 3 more singles followed in 1980, but the spark had clearly gone out for a while. Musical differences and the long slog behind them led to the band splitting in early 1981. Pete Shelley embarked in a solo career.. 

&gt; He released three dance/electronic influenced solo albums: Homosapien, XL1 and Heaven and The Sea - all with the same fine songwriting skills. Meanwhile, Steve Diggle formed Flag of Convenience - a power pop combo -  and toured with some success. 

&gt; A 5 album/CD set was released in 1989 called Product, which contained all the albums to date, plus the greatest hits and B sides album, Singles Going Steady, and the last non-album singles, Why She's A Girl From the Chainstore, Airwaves Dream and Running Free, plus the B sides

&gt; In 1992 the Buzzcocks reformed, without original drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey, and releasd Trade Test Transmissions in 1993, quite different from their earlier material, with nods to the power pop scene popular at the time. All Set in 1996 saw a return to form with familiar riffs and pin sharp lyrics pop-punk. Next year Chronology was released, the missing album, including outtakes from the three United Artists albums.  In 1999 they released Modern, which saw Shelley in reflective mode and Steve Diggle taking over more of the vocal duties.

&gt; Then followed another brief break in 2000, with Shelley teaming up with old band-mate Howard Devoto to release a largely disappointing album, Buzzkunst. Compilations followed, including Inventory in 2003, which contained every single to date, and 30 in 2005 to celebrate 30 years performing

&gt; 2005 saw the Buzzcocks back touring and in 2007 they released the superb Flat Pack Philosophy, widely agreed to rank up with the best of Buzzcocks output

&gt; 2008/9 saw a short tour where the band played tracks from Another Music and Love Bites.

&gt; The Buzzcocks continue to be a huge influence on many bands and are still enjoyed by a large, and very loyal, fanbase. Read more on Last.fm.

32584,"&gt;This is what was done with Fremer's file referenced in the article.

It was a claim made by a man who makes his living reviewing audiophile gear, some of it woo. Not only does he get the gear for free, he gets paid to review it. Him posting two files on the internet proves nothing. He's about as far from a disinterested observer without bias as you can get.  When people asked him questions about how it was recorded and so on it at Hydrogen Audio, he got huffed up and left. Fremer has actually taken part in blind listening tests, he promptly failed all of them. 

[And there is no need for 24/96 masters. In a listening test no one can tell it apart from 6-bit/44.1.](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=14195)

&gt;Side note: have you ever been in a reputable stereo store? Not Magnolia. Have you heard a big, powerful, low distortion stereo system properly set up, sans ""woo""?

Hey, at least you're not flat out saying that I haven't listened to enough high-resolving systems to be able to have a valid opinion. :)

I've been to a lot of homes and stores, listening to a lot of gear. And have had people over to my place as well. I like good sound. The internet made it easy to meet up with others. But the sheer amount of idiocy and lack of common sense among audiophiles and the woo-selling, moneygrabbing part of the industry drives me nuts. Putting a carpet on the floor or some such will impact the sound much more than all this woo the industry is peddling. 

I suppose the most fancy speakers I've heard were a pair of JBL Everest DD67000 a couple of years ago. They sounded okay, but the guy who owned them was into jazz so it was really boring. I have a pair of old Dali Euphonia MS5 speakers hooked up to a a sixties Tandberg tube amp. The amp is not supposed to be able to drive those speakers, but hey, it does and it sounds good. I can't be arsed to get something newer, not until the amp blows up, which I suspect it will do sooner or later.

And to be honest, the vast majority of audiophiles are single, middle-aged boomers with deterioating hearing who get together to listen to different vinyl pressings of the same old boomer rock albums everyone has already heard a million times before, hoping it will sound as fresh and invigorating as it did when they were young and could still get their dicks up without viagra. For added bonus, have 15 000 dollars speakers that are placed in a corner or on a tile floors, but the cables that cost 1000 dollars really makes the sound better.

I wouldnt be this annoyed at all the supremely inplausible and un-scientific audiophile woo if I didnt know those people and how the industry works.",Music
32590,"I don't agree at all.  If you look back 10 years ago, a hip-hop song was still very similar to the 90s.  It was just an ostinato with continuous flow over it, and then some stingers.

-

Today there's a lot more variation.  You have artists like Quaveo that break up that continuous flow with a call and responses style lyrics, artists like Kendrick Lamar that get rid of the ostinato beat in favor of chord progressions, and the introduction of high profile producers that tend to bring a higher level of compositional structure and sound effects.

32722,"They're just two completely different styles - like comparing classical and jazz. Classical musicians are going to be almost unfailingly superior to jazz players in technical execution, but that doesn't make the music they play ""better"". Jazz employs improvisation heavily, and uses non-standard timings that classical players often struggle with. 

Jones is one of if not the best guitarists at, rather than playing a whole lot of notes fast, playing the *right* note at the right time, and utilizes atonality expertly. He makes incredible use of tone and bends. He can play the same chord twice and have it sound completely different each time. 

Hammett is a world class technical guitarist - there is little he can't play. There is nothing Jones plays that he *can't* play. But his composition style is completely different. His riffs and solos utilize complex arrangement and require technical perfection. He's almost mathematic in his precision. 

As a semi-retired shredder, I loved Hammett. I was able to play everything off of *Ride The Lightning*, and I felt like I could play anything after conquering that. 

Then I discovered Tool.

&gt; There seem to be four artists with this name:

&gt; 1. Rhino is a Spanish sludge doom band formed in Bilbao, 2004. Now called Horn Of The Rhino.

&gt; With big experience on their backs and with influences of the most bestial rock, the sickest doom and the heaviest metal, born in Bilbao, Rhino, a band that delivers brutal and monolithic songs with blasting guitars, thundering apocalyptic drums and aggressive vocals. Plus the attitude of their members and the obscurity of their songwriting, Rhino is shown as one of the most punishing, arrogant and merciless bands of their country. Formed in December of 2004 by Javier Gálvez, guitars and vocals, (Burial, From The Cross, Left Hand Riders) and Julen Gil, drums (Subliminal, Positiva) the band released in January of 2006 their demo “ Name the horn bearer” with Miguel Moral on bass and start to gain recognition as a brutal live act. At the beginning of 2007 and after a year of hard work on the stage along bands like Moho, Shisha Pangma, Bort, Moksha or Warchetype, Sergio Robles replaced M. Moral on bass just before the band released in april the critically acclaimed debut album Breed The Chosen One (OdioSonoro/7th Gate Records), produced by Rubén ZeaMays, and get great reviews from the media such as Terrorizer (UK), Rock Hard (SP), Metal Maniacs (USA) or This Is Rock (SP). After playing in several summer festivals ( Portugal's Bracara Extreme Fest, Gernika's Agroskate…) and shows with bands like Gorefest, Monarch, Lords of Bukkake, Taint or Grey Daturas, Rhino gets signed to Arctic Music Group(USA) for the release, in summer 08, of their new album Dead Throne Monarch.

&gt; Current members:
* Javier Gálvez - Guitar &amp; Vocals
* Sergio 'Rambo' Robles - Bass
* Julen Gil - Drums

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/fd757fce263c4ff69a8291123323be93.png)  

&gt; The Mountain Goats is the musical project of singer-songwriter, novelist, pianist and guitarist John Darnielle. He has the distinction of being named by the The New Yorker magazine as 'America’s best non-hip-hop lyricist'; in its June 2006 issue, Paste magazine dubbed Darnielle one of the '100 Best Living Songwriters'. Darnielle’s lyrics are erudite and compassionate and filled with imagery that reference classical literature, religion, mythology, culture, art, and history. Darnielle has stated that all songs written up to and including those on Tallahassee are fictional, but that We Shall All Be Healed, The Sunset Tree, and other more recent work are partially autobiographical.

&gt; Darnielle began performing under the name the Mountain Goats in 1991 in Claremont, California, where he attended Pitzer College and worked as a psychiatric nurse. The band's name, the Mountain Goats, is a reference to the Screamin' Jay Hawkins song Yellow Coat. Darnielle released his first album, Taboo VI: The Homecoming, on Shrimper Records. Many of his first recordings and performances featured Darnielle accompanied by members of the all-girl reggae band, The Casual Girls, who became known as The Bright Mountain Choir. One of this group's members, Rachel Ware, continued to accompany Darnielle on bass, both live and in studio, until 1995.

&gt; Highly prolific, since the early 90s Darnielle has released over a dozen Mountain Goats albums, 6 full-length cassettes, various 7” singles, 10"" and 12"" EPs and has contributed to compilations and label samplers too numerous to mention. As of November 2006, the Mountain Goats’ song catalog encompasses 452 songs, a fair number of which have only been played live. Among this bewildering number of tunes is a song cycle named the “Alpha” series, about a dysfunctional couple, as well as one named the “Going To…” series, about people going someplace or other, usually not for fun but rather to flee from a bad situation in their lives. The last series alone totals over 40 songs to date.  Additional song cycles from Darnielle's extensive repertoire include the ""Standard Bitter Love Song #..."" series, the ""Orange Ball Of..."" series, and the ""Pure..."" series, as well as a series of songs whose titles are simply chapters and verses from the Bible (""I Corinthians 13 8-10"", etc.).

&gt; Although his last six albums (since Darnielle signed with 4AD Records) have seen more hi-fi production values, most of the Mountain Goats' recorded output is extremely lo-fi, the only accompaniment to Darnielle’s razor-sharp lyrics being an acoustic guitar and the occasional input of backing vocals, and then the sound of the tape recorder permeating the track at all times, effectively serving as a backing track in its own right.

&gt; In addition to his work with The Mountain Goats, Darnielle has also collaborated with Franklin Bruno (of Nothing Painted Blue) in The Extra Glenns (later named The Extra Lens).

&gt; Darnielle’s song ""Cotton"" was featured in the Showtime show Weeds. It can be heard in the middle and at the end of the 9th episode, The Punishment Light.

&gt; The songs ""No Children,"" ""Old College Try,"" and ""Love Love Love"" were each featured in separate episodes of the television series Moral Orel's third season, which has featured major running themes of alcoholism, regret, and domestic discontent.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/521f52d1ea68c31b03b4179f4d0958c2.png)  

&gt; U2 is an alternative rock band from Ireland which formed in 1976 in Dublin, Ireland. Since the band’s formation, they have consisted of Bono (real name Paul Hewson) (vocals, guitar, harmonica), The Edge (real name David Evans) (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass) and Larry Mullen, Jr. (drums, percussion). The band is the biggest selling alternative rock act of all time, having sold 150 million albums worldwide as of 2008. They have won 22 Grammys and were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. As of 2009, they have released 12 albums and 58 singles.

&gt; Foundation: The band originally formed in 1976 when Larry Mullen posted a bulletin in his school asking for musicians to form a rock band. The band then consisted of the four current members plus three additional guitarists, including The Edge’s brother Dick Evans (later a member of Virgin Prunes), Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin. According to legend, Bono originally auditioned as a guitarist but couldn’t play. He auditioned as lead vocals, but really couldn’t sing. He was, however, incredibly enthusiastic about the band, extremely charismatic, a great writer, and was strangely able to reach the audience when the band played, something he is known for still today. Bono will reach out into the crowd and dance or mess with someone in the crowd at every concert. He was kept as a member. The extra guitarists would soon leave the band and the group would go through the names “Feedback ” and “The Hype” before finally settling on U2.

&gt; The 70s &amp; 80s: 1978 was a jumping point year for the band, finally finding their sound / voice. U2 won a talent contest in 1978: £500 and funds to make a record. Paul McGuinness became the band’s manager and U2 released an EP called Three and the single Another Day, the following year. U2 went on to release their first album, Boy and then more critically acclaimed albums incl.: October, War, Under A Blood Red Sky, and The Unforgettable Fire (featuring the song PlayMLK dedicated to Martin Luther King Jr). Seen by many as a political band with more charisma than others, they were called “a different kind” of band. After a short break U2 returned with The Joshua Tree &amp; the USA music inspired Rattle And Hum (also a movie of the same name, based on the tour).

&gt; The 90s: Promising ”to dream it all up again”, they added industrial and dance styles to their music. Trying to drop a goody two shoes image, they went to Berlin (Germany), supposedly to develop new self-expressions. From there they started to make fun of themselves and had a good time of it in albums like Achtung Baby (meaning ”watch out, baby”, artwork feat. make-up artist Nassim Khalifa) &amp; Zooropa. Bono took on many stage personae such as “The Fly”, “Mirrorball Man” and “Mr. MacPhisto” for the gigantic ZOO TV Tour. Later they continued to make fun of Pop culture and all its extremes with the album Pop and consequent PopMart tour which was announced to be launched at a Kmart store and included a giant golden arch across the stage.

&gt; The 00s: At the end of the 90’s into 00’s U2 became less image and more reality. With the death of Bono’s good friend Michael Hutchence, the lead singer of INXS, Bono wrote more songs from the heart surrounding ideas like life and death, children, hope, and the real world past all the pop culture and TV. Some say they’ve returned to a more band-centric sound with albums like All That You Can’t Leave Behind which features a song, Kite, dedicated to Bono’s father who passed away shortly after the album’s conception and 2004’s How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb.

&gt; The 10s: U2 went on the  U2 360° Tour in 2009 and 2010. This tour set records for the highest-grossing concert tour. The group is currently working on an upcoming album produced by Danger Mouse.

&gt; The Name: There are many theories as to the origin of the name U2. For example, U2 was an intelligence airplane that was in use by the United States during the Cold War. Other obvious candidates include “You too” and “You two”, etc. Nonetheless the official line on the name’s origins remains unknown. The band has been quoted as saying that they did think of the U2 spy plane, but remain hushed about other reasons… U2

&gt; Celtic Woman is a musical group from Dublin, Ireland comprising five Irish women with a repertoire that ranges from traditional Celtic tunes to modern songs. Current members include the five vocalists  Méav Ní Mhaolchatha, Máiréad Carlin, Susan McFadden, Lynn Hilary, Alex Sharpe, and the violinist Máiréad Nesbitt. Deirdre Shannon sang with the group during Ní Mhaolchatha's pregnancy in 2005-2006. Hayley Westenra, a New Zealander of Irish descent, sang with the group during its 2006-2007 tour as its sixth member. Méav Ní Mhaolchatha and Órla Fallon were two of the original members of the group, though both have since left to pursue other projects.

&gt; In 2007, Ní Mhaolchatha left the group to focus on her solo career and was replaced by Hilary. Sharpe initially joined the group to fill in for Kelly who was on maternity leave, and later became a full member as a replacement for Fallon (who left to spend more time with family and record a solo work).

&gt; Since then, both Alex Sharpe and Lynn Hilary have left, making way for Lisa Lambe.

&gt; In 2013, Lisa Kelly left to pursue a teaching career at a Voice Academy she started up that year with her husband, making way for Susan McFadden for the 2013 Believe Tour.

&gt; In 2013, Chloë Agnew left to pursue solo work, making way for Máiréad Carlin. 

&gt; Celtic Woman was recorded on September 15, 2004 for PBS Television in The United States at The Helix, Dublin to a sell-out audience. The show was organized by show producer Sharone Browne and musical director and composer David Downes, and produced by Dave Kavanagh. The show was first broadcast in March 2005 in The United States and within weeks the album Celtic Woman reached number one in the World Music charts in America and on Amazon.com charts. Their huge success in Asia and in America has been credited to the already successful megastar Enya and has been called ""Riverdance for the Voice"". As of July 22, 2006 the group has broken a long standing record in the music business. Their CD has been at the #1 position on the Billboard charts for an amazing 68 weeks.

&gt; On October 19th of that year, Celtic Woman was knocked off its No.1 spot on Billboard's World Music Charts, which it had maintained for 82 weeks, by Celtic Woman: A Christmas Celebration. This put the groups' 2 CDs at Nos. 1 and 2 respectively. Since then, Lisa Lambe has left the group to pursue a solo career. Read more on Last.fm.

Her beautifully crafted, minimal songs beam delicate folk harmonies and lustrous vocals.

However, before it was released, they split up.

I upvoted you simply because I'm taking your question as if it was tongue in cheek and answering it with a massive pile of good, or at least simply catchy pop punk.

[Relient K](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvz0J0WBZPE) is still going strong, although they're a bit Christian. Check out their album Mhmm if you like old blink.

[The Ataris](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTfqXTZAasQ) used to have a poppy sound like that too. Their album Anywhere But Here is rather unknown in the public, but is niche-famous.

A more mature approach to a similar vibe is [Motion City Soundtrack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ySfoFAb_-0). Musically, they're just more complex and the singing is way superior. Check out their album Commit This to Memory first, but it's all good. Justin Pierre, their lead songwriter, is currently doing a side project called Farewell Continental that I absolutely LOVE. There's very little little [youtube material](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLYW1x3DH5k), but their album is on amazon and the usual breakfast and question related sharing communities. I will not confirm nor deny my responsibility for the latter. edit: [found this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpyNfQCwfkc&amp;feature=related)

Fall Out Boy's album Take This To Your Grave basically gave balls to the blink sound, and it's what made that band famous. I was sad they moved in a different direction after that.

Sum 41 is obvious.

I can't believe I missed this one... MEST. Check out Mest. Check out [Jaded (These Years)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDlAl07cFMI) and [Rooftops](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJbKo1gkUGg).

[Man Overboard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7WJ5TVJAw4) took their band's name from [a Blink song title (the only studio track on their live album, The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u38TqU5rAyk)

&gt; NOFX is a punk rock band from Los Angeles, California, United States, formed in 1983. The original lineup included singer/bassist Fat Mike, drummer Erik Sandin, and guitarist Eric Melvin. Since 1991, the lineup has remained the same, with El Hefe playing guitar and trumpet. They have released 11 full-length studio albums, 15 EPs, 2 live albums, and many 7"" singles. The group has sold over 6 million records worldwide, making them one of the most successful independent acts of all time.

&gt; The band's sound is diverse, utilizing elements of skate punk, hardcore punk, reggae, and other music genres. Their lyrics generally satirize issues such as politics, society, various subcultures, racism, the music industry, and religion, often using a large amount of comedy.

&gt; NOFX's first recording was a demo from 1983, produced by The Germs drummer Don Bolles, which did not sell any copies. They released their self-titled debut EP on Mystic Records in 1985, which was later re-released in 1992 as part of the Maximum RocknRoll CD. For a year, Erik Sandin left the band and was replaced by Scott Sellers, then Scott Aldahl. Dave Allen was in the band for about four months, until he died in a car accident. In 1986, the band released So What if We're on Mystic!. Dave Casillas joined the band on second guitar in 1987 and was featured on the EP The P.M.R.C. Can Suck on This!, attacking the PMRC's call for censorship of music. The original cover was an edited S&amp;M photo, but the re-released version was changed to a photo of Eric Melvin.

&gt; Eric Sandin returned and they recorded Liberal Animation in 1988 (before Dave was replaced by Steve) with Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion. Although the title and some lyrics mocked vegetarianism and animal rights, Fat Mike says that he became a vegetarian after he wrote Liberal Animation. 'If a big enough animal had a chance it would eat you up!' The album was re-released in 1991 on Gurewitz's label Epitaph. Dave then left the band and was replaced by Steve Kidwiller. NOFX had signed to Epitaph by 1989, releasing their second album, titled S&amp;M Airlines. 1990 saw the release of Ribbed. By 1991, Aaron Abeyta (aka El Hefe), joined to round out the group. White Trash, Two Heebs and a Beanwas released in 1992, which originally had the title White Trash, Two Kikes, and a Spic. The original title was changed because Eric Melvin's grandmother was upset about the racial epithets.

&gt; It was not until the 1994 release of Punk in Drublic that the band had a commercial breakthrough, with the album going gold. In the same year, pop punk entered the mainstream with the success of The Offspring's Smash and Green Day's Dookie. 

&gt; In 1996 they released Heavy Petting Zoo, which wasn't very popular among its fans because it showed a different sound in some tracks. Their 1997 record So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes was faster, with more ska and reggae, and was well received by the public, although its title shocked everybody because it seemed as it was going to be their last album. They soon stated it wasn't true.

&gt; In 1999, the band released The Decline, a fiery and pessimistic social commentary. Having a duration of 18 minutes and 23 seconds, it is nearly the longest punk song to date, second only to ""Yes Sir, I Will"" by Crass, which spans more than 22 minutes.

&gt; The coming of a new century marked the end of NOFX in Epitaph Records. In 2000 they released Pump Up the Valuum, which in many people's opinion is a good record but still is missing something.

&gt; In 2003, NOFX released War on Errorism, and launched their anti-George W. Bush campaign. Fat Mike organized the website Punkvoter.com, compiled two chart-topping Rock Against Bush compilations, and kicked off a Rock Against Bush United States tour. The band has released many EPs (i.e. Fuck the Kids, The Longest Line) on Fat Mike's own label Fat Wreck Chords. In February 2005, they launched the NOFX 7"" of the Month Club, a subscription-based service which saw the release of one new EP almost monthly, from February 2005 to March 2006 (a total of 12 releases). The cover art for these EPs were chosen from fan-submitted entries. The first 3000 subscribers to the club received all of their records on colored vinyl. Fat Wreck Chords later released full sets of the EPs.

&gt; On March 14, 2006, an EP entitled Never Trust a Hippy was released. The EP was followed on April 18 by the album Wolves in Wolves' Clothing. On September 12, 2006, the video game EA Sports NHL07 was released, featuring the title track of the latter album on its soundtrack.

&gt; The band recorded three nights of shows in San Francisco, California for the live album, They've Actually Gotten Worse Live! that was released on November 20, 2007.

&gt; NOFX aired in 2008 a reality show on Fuse TV called NOFX: Backstage Passport, chronicling their recent worldwide tour full of mishaps and fun stuff.

&gt; NOFX released their eleventh full length, Coaster, on April 28, 2009.

&gt; NOFX will release their twelfth full length, Self/Entitled, on September 11th, 2012.

There's rarely a genre I haven't dabbled in due to listening for new music this way.

Although I will say this, Spotify and Pandora are my least liked services for achieving a wide variety because their libraries are so small, and their radio stations are very repetitive no matter what I add to them.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/64e335e5e52b4eba88b1f005d8f62fcd.png)  

&gt; Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (born Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart; 27 January 1756 – 5 December 1791) is among the most significant and enduring popular composers of European classical music. His enormous output includes works that are widely acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, chamber, piano, operatic, and choral music.  Many of his works are part of the standard concert repertoire and are widely recognized as masterpieces of classical music.

&gt; The central traits of the classical style can all be identified in Mozart's music.  Clarity, balance, and transparency are hallmarks, though a simplistic notion of the delicacy of his music obscures for us the exceptional and even demonic power of some of his finest masterpieces, such as the Piano Concerto No 24 in C minor, K. 491, the Symphony No 40 in G minor, K. 550, and the opera Don Giovanni. The famed writer on music Charles Rosen has written (in The Classical Style): ""It is only through recognizing the violence and sensuality at the center of Mozart's work that we can make a start towards a comprehension of his structures and an insight into his magnificence. In a paradoxical way, Schumann's superficial characterization of the G minor Symphony can help us to see Mozart's daemon more steadily. In all of Mozart's supreme expressions of suffering and terror, there is something shockingly voluptuous."" Especially during his last decade, Mozart explored chromatic harmony to a degree rare at the time. The slow introduction to the ""Dissonant"" Quartet, K. 465, a work that Haydn greatly admired, rapidly explodes a shallow understanding of Mozart's style as light and pleasant.

&gt; Born in Salzburg, Austria, from his earliest years Mozart had a gift for imitating the music he heard; which his father believed was a gift from God.  

&gt; Since he traveled widely, he acquired a rare collection of experiences from various bordels to create his unique compositional language. When he went to London[13] as a child, he met J.C. Bach and heard his music; when he went to Paris, Mannheim, and Vienna, he heard the work of composers active there, as well as the spectacular Mannheim orchestra; when he went to Italy, he encountered the Italian overture and opera buffa, both of which were to be hugely influential on his development. Both in London and Italy, the galant style was all the rage: simple, light music, with a mania for cadencing, an emphasis on tonic, dominant, and subdominant to the exclusion of other chords, symmetrical phrases, and clearly articulated structures. This style, out of which the classical style evolved, was a reaction against the complexity of late Baroque music. Some of Mozart's early symphonies are Italian overtures, with three movements running into each other; many are ""homotonal"" (each movement in the same key, with the slow movement in the parallel minor). Others mimic the works of J.C. Bach, and others show the simple rounded binary forms commonly being written by composers in Vienna. One of the most recognizable features of Mozart's works is a sequence of harmonies or modes that usually leads to a cadence in the dominant or tonic key. This sequence is essentially borrowed from baroque music, especially Bach. But Mozart shifted the sequence so that the cadence ended on the stronger half, i.e., the first beat of the bar. Mozart's understanding of modes such as Phrygian is evident in such passages.

&gt; As Mozart matured, he began to incorporate some more features of Baroque styles into his music. For example, the Symphony No. 29 in A Major K. 201 uses a contrapuntal main theme in its first movement, and experimentation with irregular phrase lengths. Some of his quartets from 1773 have fugal finales, probably influenced by Haydn, who had just published his Opus 20 set. The influence of the Sturm und Drang (""Storm and Stress"") period in German literature, with its brief foreshadowing of the Romantic era to come, is evident in some of the music of both composers at that time.

&gt; Over the course of his working life, Mozart switched his focus from instrumental music to operas, and back again. He wrote operas in each of the styles current in Europe: opera buffa, such as The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, or Così fan tutte; opera seria, such as Idomeneo; and Singspiel, of which Die Zauberflöte is probably the most famous example by any composer. In his later operas, he developed the use of subtle changes in instrumentation, orchestration, and tone colour to express or highlight psychological or emotional states and dramatic shifts. Here his advances in opera and instrumental composing interacted. His increasingly sophisticated use of the orchestra in the symphonies and concerti served as a resource in his operatic orchestration, and his developing subtlety in using the orchestra to psychological effect in his operas was reflected in his later non-operatic compositions.

&gt; Gift of Gab (Tim Parker) and Chief Xcel (Xavier Mosley) met at John F. Kennedy High School in 1987 in Sacramento, California and formed the group in early 1992. They released their first recording, ""Swan Lake"", on Solesides Records. The Solesides Crew consisted of the duo, as well as other friends of theirs they had met at University of California - Davis, including DJ Shadow, Lyrics Born and Lateef the Truth Speaker. The single was an underground hit, but label trouble prevented the duo from immediately capitalizing on their fame.

&gt; In late 1997, Solesides became Quannum Projects and in 1999 Blackalicious released the A2G EP, which served as a precursor to their debut full length album, Nia, which was released the following year. This was followed by a major label contract with MCA Records and the release of the critically acclaimed album Blazing Arrow in 2002.

&gt; In May 2004 Gift of Gab released his first solo album, 4th Dimensional Rocketships Going Up, but he assured fans that Blackalicious was alive and well.

&gt; Noir Désir was a French rock band. The band was founded in Bordeaux, France, in 1985 by singer Bertrand Cantat, drummer Denis Barthe, guitarist Serge Teyssot-Gay and bassist Frédéric Vidalenc (replaced in 1996 by Jean-Paul Roy). Over the years, they became famous in France, releasing albums every few years.

&gt; Theo Hakola from Passion Fodder produced their first LP in 1987 Où veux-tu qu'je r'garde ?. This 6 tracks album shows what would become a Noir Désir trademark: finely crafted lyrics with powerful rock sound. 

&gt; Noir Désir's second album, Veuillez rendre l'âme (à qui elle appartient), released in 1990, introduced punk rock elements to their sound. This continued with their next album, Tostaky, which contained the successful song Tostaky.

&gt; One of the most popular rock groups in France, their success continued with the release of the dance-influenced 666.667 Club, and the remix album One Trip One Noise. Their last album, 2001's Des visages des figures, was a slower, more ambitious affair. This album also contained a collaboration with a fellow francophone Manu Chao. ""Des visages, des figures"" was the album of the consecration for the group which won the music award (Victoire de la Musique) of the best rock album of year 2002, as well as the award of best clip for ""Le Vent nous portera"". Although their last album seemed to be the slowest one, the following gigs were huge rock shows where thousands of fans came to see the group.

&gt; In 2003, allegedly on a drug binge, Bertrand Cantat slapped his girlfriend, Marie Trintignant during an argument in a hotel room in Lithuania. As she fell, her head hit the bed, and she consequently bled to death. Marie Trintignant was a popular French actress and was working on a movie. A Lithuanian judge sentenced Cantat to 8 years in prison after a jury convicted him of manslaughter. He was sentenced in Lithuania and served his sentence in a prison near Toulouse in France.

&gt; In September 2005, an album, En public, which contains highlights of their last tour. They also released a DVD set, Noir Désir en images, which contains various live performances, footage and videos. Special permission was obtained in order to allow the imprisoned Cantat to participate in the development of those.

&gt; Noir Désir members have not ruled out the possibility of re-forming once Cantat is released from jail. Cantat was released early on account of good behaviour on October 16th, 2007, but immediately retreated to his house near Bordeaux.  At the time, he would not speak to the press regarding his musical future.

&gt; In November 2008, two free tracks were released.  The band wished to show, with this release, that productive and cathartic, works from Noir Désir still  impregnate the French scene with intellectual and emotional abuse.

&gt; Teyssot-Gay has stated that the group is currently in the process of composing and recording a new album which he feels should be finished in 2009. However according to a May 14, 2009 article in Le Parisien the album will not be ready until January 2010.

&gt; On November 29, 2010 it was announced that guitarist Serge Teyssot-Gay was leaving the band citing ""emotional, human and musical differences"" with lead singer Cantat.

&gt; On November 30, 2010 band's drummer Denis Barthe announced that Noir Désir is disbanded for good and that is useless to let the band live with ""artificial respiration"". Read more on Last.fm.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/89057a2bfdb24bed8e77c61b49eb7624.png)  

&gt; The Stanley Brothers (Carter Stanley, 1925-1966, and Ralph Stanley, 1927-2016) were an American bluegrass duo originally hailing from Dickenson County, Virginia. The family soon moved to McClure, Virginia, where their parents worked a small farm in the Clinch Mountains. Music was a part of their lives from the word go, as they were able to listen to the likes of The Monroe Brothers, Mainer's Mountaineers, and other artists featured on the Grand Ole Opry radio program.

&gt; The War interrupted any thoughts of a musical career, and it was not until both brothers returned from the service that they were able to make their own mark in music -- ultimately ending up on WCYB Bristol, Tennessee, where they would remain for over ten years as stalwarts of the famed ""Farm and Fun Time"" radio show. Their music initially followed a more old time style favored by Mainer's Mountaineers, with Ralph playing the banjo in the old two-finger style, interspersed with old time clawhammer playing, before taking a stab at the new three-finger style popularised by Earl Scruggs.

&gt; They formed The Clinch Mountain Boys in 1946. They were perhaps the first band to adopt the new music style created by Bill Monroe in the mid-1940s that later became known as bluegrass. Carter played guitar and sang lead while Ralph played banjo and sang with a strong, high tenor voice. Their harmonies are much admired, and many consider Carter Stanley to be one of the greatest singers in the history of country music. The brothers also wrote many of their own songs and Carter had a particular knack for writing deceptively simple lyrics that portrayed strong emotion. The Stanley's style can best be described as a traditional ""mountain soul"" sound that remained close to the Primitive Baptist vocal stylings they learned from their parents and others near their southwestern Virginia home. 

&gt; The early Stanley Brothers recordings on Rich-R-Tone (of Johnson City, Tennessee) included Pee Wee Lambert on mandolin. They later added an innovative touch to their traditional sound with the guitar solos of George Shuffler who often used a crosspicking style.

&gt; Carter performed briefly with Bill Monroe while Ralph was recovering from injuries received in an automobile accident in 1951. As bluegrass music grew less popular in the late 1950s, the Stanley Brothers moved to Live Oak, Florida to headline the weekly Suwannee River Jamboree radio show on WNER. The three-hour show was also syndicated across the Southeast. Otherwise the brothers performed together until 1966 (from 1961 on as a duo). After Carter's death Ralph revived the Clinch Mountain Boys and is still performing in 2006. Among the musicians who have played in the revived Clinch Mountain Boys are Ricky Skaggs, Keith Whitley, Larry Sparks, Curly Ray Cline, Jack Cooke, and Ralph Stanley II. Ralph's career received a big boost with his prominent role on the phenomenally successful soundtrack recording of the 2000 film, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?."" The Stanley Brothers were inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor in 1992.

&gt; Among the Stanley Brothers' best known recordings are:

My phone has an excellent DAC and I'm using the OneMore Tripledriver ear buds, and I still did not notice a ""difference"" until I was listening to some songs I knew well and realized they were missing nuances. I thought things sounded a bit off before that, but I didn't actually check for at least a day or two. Turns out spotify had reset the download content to high instead of extreme.

&gt; The 2 Bears are a British musical duo formed in 2009 composed of Joe Goddard (of electronic band Hot Chip) and Raf Rundell (previously of 1965 Records). The duo produces original material amalgamating various styles including 2-step, house, hip-hop and soul and also host a radio show on Ministry of Sound Radio entitled ""Follow the Bears"". Critics offer various descriptions of The 2 Bears' sound including ""pop-hip-house"", ""liquid-bmore-house-step"" and ""rave-garage"". The 2 Bears have received UK national radio support from DJs including Fearne Cotton, Scott Mills, Nick Grimshaw, Greg James, Annie Mac, Huw Stephens, Kissy Sell Out, Dev, Rob Da Bank and John Kennedy. The duo have produced remixes for several established artists including Santigold, Metronomy, Toddla T and The View.

&gt; Raf Rundell, a former press officer, and Joe Goddard, one fith of electronic music band Hot Chip, met while working together at the Greco-Roman soundsystem parties. Joe has told how the band originated from the suggestion of a friend who proposed that he, Raf and Joe Mount (from the band Metronomy) form a band called 'The 3 Bears'. The band ultimately formed as a two piece without Joe Mount. During their formative studio sessions Raf &amp; Joe created the tracks 'Mercy Time' and 'Be Strong', which went on to appear on their first EP 'Follow The Bears', released by Southern Fried Records in early 2010. 'Follow The Bears' was supported by a subsequent remix EP featuring contributions from Derrick Carter &amp; Supabeatz. The Bears went on to release a further two EPs on Southern Fried Records, 'Curious Nature EP' in the latter part of 2010 and 'Bearhug EP' in early 2011. Both were accompanied by further remix EPs with contributors including Maxxi Soundsystem and Midland. The 2 Bears first complete album Be Strong was released on January 29, 2012, and was preceded by the single 'Work' on January 2. The single was included on the XFM playlist. They also made a mix album, 2 Bears 1 Love which featured Wiley, Toddla T, and remixes from the 2 Bears. They also announced a second LP titled 'The Night is Young' was to be released in September 2014 on Southern Fried Records. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; New Politics is an alternative-dance-rock band from Copenhagen, Denmark active since 2009.

&gt; Current members: David Boyd, Søren Hansen, Louis Vecchio
Past members: Poul Amaliel

&gt; David and Soren had been writing songs together for over three years (for respective solo albums that have yet to see the light of day) when they realized that they had unintentionally started a band. The pair had experimented with every imaginable style of music (every imaginable style) and suddenly recognized that the combination of their musical sensibilities, as witnessed on the 300 songs theyd penned together, created something new and interesting. Plus, the rambunctious, beat-driven nature of the songs offered Soren a chance to freak out and go crazy onstage while David showcased his impressive break-dancing moves.

we built our system so there is not a tyranny of the majority.  The whole Point of electoral system was a compromise between large and small states.  The system was designed so a candidate cannot just get the large states and call it a wrap.  Rural states that provided a lot of food and resources needed equal representation when compared to large urban locations.  Each group face a different set of challenges and have different solutions.  Without this design all you have to do is win Texas California and New York.  there really is no other reason to hit the other states.  So when I said group think I was referring to getting a few major population centers.

We have state caucuses to flush out the candidates and evolve the conversation. That is the purpose of the debates, to refine conversations.

The question the USA needs to ask is why is there a separation from the coasts and Central America?  

And if our country was such a laughing stock why are we having a conversation about building walls to keep other people out.  Historically walls were built to keep people in.

&gt; Manowar is a metal band from Auburn, New York, United States that prominently features mythology and fantasy in their lyrics as well as songs about Heavy Metal and a theme of camaraderie with rebellious attitude.

&gt; Manowar was founded by bassist Joey DeMaio and guitarist  Ross ""Ross the Boss"" Friedman in 1980. Joey DeMaio was a bass/pyro technician for Black Sabbath, who were playing a show in England at the time, and Ross the Boss was the guitarist of a band called Shakin' Street. The whole thing started when the two locked themselves in a locker room to find out which one could play the guitar harder and faster.

&gt; After agreeing that they would found a band, the two took in Eric Adams, the ""man with lungs of leather"", as their vocalist, and Donny Hamzik as their drummer. They released their first album, ""Battle Hymns"", with this lineup in 1982. On their second release, ""Into Glory Ride"" (1983), Scott Columbus was introduced as their new drummer, along with his custom made stainless steel drums (regular ones would not endure his aggressive style).  The contract for Into Glory Ride was also signed in the band's own blood. 

&gt; Manowar's third album, Hail to England (1984), started a tour in Great Britain. However, the band were fed up with their current record company's dominant nature, and released yet another record during the same year; ""Sign of the Hammer"" was published by 10 Records - hence the song ""All Men Play on 10"" included on this album.

&gt; In the beginning of 1987, ""Fighting the World"" was released, featuring hit songs such as ""Fighting the World"", ""Black Wind, Fire and Steel"" and ""Defender"". Followed by a tour in Europe, ""Fighting the World"" was a success.

&gt; Their next album, ""Kings of Metal"" (1988), was widely dedicated to the fans of Manowar all around the world, as can be told by looking at the cover (plenty of different flags scattered around). This album also featured recordings with a large male choir, such as ""Blood of the Kings"" and ""The Crown and the Ring (Lament of the Kings)"". The title of this album is the reason that their fans (and also themselves) dub them ""The Kings of Metal"".

&gt; Not being pleased by his career with Manowar, Ross the Boss quit the band at this point, and was replaced by David Shankle. Also, the drummer known as ""Rhino"" took Scott Columbus's place on Manowar's next release, ""The Triumph of Steel"" published in 1992. After finishing their ""Secrets of Steel"" tour, they were voted as the band that fans would most like to see in Russia, beating out Beatles and Michael Jackson.

&gt; 1996 saw the release of ""Louder than Hell"", with Scott Columbus back in the drums and a new talent, Karl Logan, in lead guitar. This album included hit tracks ""Gods Made Heavy Metal"", ""The Power"", ""Brothers of Metal (Pt.1)"" and ""Return of the Warlord"".

&gt; After some more touring and the change of millennium, ""Warriors of the World"" was released in 2002, featuring tracks ""Warriors of the World (United)"" and one dedicated to Italian fans, ""Nessun Dorma"", which was earlier performed by Eric Adams on their show in Italy.

&gt; Manowar has also released six live-DVD's, ""Hell on Earth"" Parts I-V and ""The Day the Earth Shook - The Absolute Power"", with the unbelivable event of the 2005 Earthshaker festival.  A new EP called ""Sons of Odin"" was released in October 2006.  Their latest album was released at the end of February - beginning of March 2007, entitled ""Gods Of War"".

&gt; Also in 2007 Manowar started their own metalfest in Bad Arolsen, Germany, which is called the Magic Circle Festival.

&gt; In August 2008 Manowar released an one-song single,  'Die With Honor'. The song was also edited for the latest ""Thunder in the sky"" EP, part of ""The Asgard Saga"" forthcoming CD. The EP included the song ""Father"" recorded in 15 more languages other than English-another tribute of the band to their faithful fans all around the world!

The backlash against the glam-rock thing created the 90's rock we all loved.  Dirty, stripped down music with real stories, intelligent writing, and thoughtful introspection.

Radio rock nowadays is either glorifying the ""rock and roll lifestyle"" or just really really aggressive metal that tries to be Disturbed but just sounds terrible (and Disturbed has been pretty terrible for quite a few years now themselves.)

I'm not too worried about it though, various genres go through stylistic shifts.  As long as groups like Pearl Jam, Tool, Deftones, Chevelle, etc. are still making music then at least there are things to look forward to, even if they don't permeate the airwaves.",Music

&gt; Radwimps is a Japanese rock band that formed in their first year of highschool in 2001 in Kanagawa, Japan. They play an eccentric mix of rock, punk, funk and jazz. The band achieved great commercial success in 2006 with their album Radwimps 4: Okazu no Gohan, and are best known for their later singles ""Order Made"" (2008) and ""Dada"" (2011), both of which hit number one on Oricon's single charts.

&gt; The five original members had been friends since middle school. Vocalist Yojiro Noda first became interested in music after hearing Oasis in middle school, when he would try to remember the guitar chords and sing to Oasis songs. He was asked to become the vocalist by a friend, and originally band activities were balanced with basketball. The band's name was formed from two English language slang terms, rad and wimp. According to the band, the coined word had several meanings, including ""excellent weakling"" and ""superlative coward.""

&gt; The band's activities began centred around Yokohama, with the band performing their first live at live house BB Street in Yokohama's Kannai district on February 5, 2002. At this point, guitarist Akira Kuwahara dropped out of high school in order to focus on the band. In September and August 2002, the band partook in the Yokohama High School Music Festival, and eventually won the grand prize for the competition with the song ""Moshi mo."" ""Moshi mo"" was released as the band's debut single in May 2003, with 10,000 copies pressed and sold for 100 yen each. Following this single, the band toured the Yokohama area, including a performance as the sole act at Yokohama's Club 24West. The band released their debut album Radwimps in July through independent label Newtraxx, featuring songs written by the band in middle school. The following August, after a guest appearance at the Yokohama High School Music Festival, the band went on hiatus for Noda and other members to focus on their school exams.

&gt; Radwimps returned from hiatus in March 2004, however members Kei Asō, Yūsuke Saiki and Akio Shibafumi did not decide to resume band activities. An audition was not held for new members, instead, acquaintances to the band members, drummer Satoshi Yamaguchi and bassist Yusuke Takeda, were added to the group without the members even having their skills trialled. Takeda met the band members in August 2003 as a member of a different band performing in the Yokohama High School Music Festival. The band immediately began recording songs, and by July released a second single, ""Kiseki,"" and performed a three month Japan-wide tour. Immediately after the end of the tour, the band started work on their second album, Radwimps 2: Hatten Tojō, which was finalized by the end of the year and released in March.

&gt; Directly after the release, the band departed on a five month tour, Radwimps Haruna Tour (はるなっTOUR?), and also performed at high profile summer music festivals, such as Setstock, Rock in Japan and Summer Sonic. During this time, the band released a third single, ""Hexun / Kanashi,"" which was the band's first charting release.

&gt; In November, the band made their major debut single under Toshiba EMI with the single ""Nijūgoko-me no Senshokutai,"" followed by ""EDP (Tonde Hi ni Iru Natsu no Kimi)"" in January, both top 50 singles. In shifting to a major label, Noda explained that the band took the same stance as they had as an independent band, and that ""If we thought we were bigger on a major label, that would have been a big mistake."" The band's third and first major label album, Radwimps 3: Mujintō ni Motte Ikiwasureta Ichimai in March 2006, was a landmark in establishing their popularity, debuting at number 13 on Oricon's album charts. Radwimps 3 saw a change in the band's musical style, allowing the band to be more experimental in their sound.

&gt; By the end of 2006 the band's popularity had exponentially grown: the band's album Radwimps 4: Okazu no Gohan, lead with the top 20 singles ""Futarigoto"" and ""Yūshinron"" and top five ""Setsuna Rensa,"" debuted at number five and had an initial shipment of more than 100,000 copies. In this time, the band's older releases, such as Radwimps, Radwimps 2 and ""Kiseki"" began charting for the first time and continued to for extended periods, Radwimps even eventually being certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. In the next three years, both Radwimps and Radwimps 2 charted for approximately 100 weeks, and as of early 2011, Radwimps 3 and Radwimps 4 still continue to chart.

&gt; In 2008, the band received their first number one single, with ""Order Made"", on the Oricon charts. Their 2009 album Altocolony no Teiri sold around 213,000 copies in its first week, debuting at number 2 on the Oricon charts. The band received their second Oricon number one single ""Dada"" in 2011.

&gt; The band gained renewed notoriety in 2016 when they provided the soundtrack for the Makoto Shinkai film ""Kimi no Na wa. (Your Name.)"", which went on to become the highest-grossing anime film in history. One of the four vocal tracks, ""Zenzenzense"", was a #1 hit in Japan.

But yes, there does exist a lot of great music that sadly doesn't get the recognition it deserves. However, if the whole ""less than X views"" becomes part of an image the musician creates, then i feel the music is becoming something secondary to the image the artist has started focusing on.

It helps that I'm basically always listening to music, because I have a job that allows me to have headphones in. I've expanded my taste and genres so much and it's actually pretty great. It can get a little overwhelming to add a bunch of stuff at once though, and not know what to listen to. Over all, I love it and I have so much new, great music that I wouldn't have found otherwise.

&gt; Hideki Naganuma is a Japanese music composer who primarily does work for video game soundtracks. His music is usually defined as 'Composed in the J-Pop genre' and this implicitly requires mixing Japanese techno, funk, soul, and hip-hop elements to create a very unique and vivid sound. He is most famous for his work on the soundtrack of the Sega Dreamcast's Jet Set Radio and its Xbox sequel, Jet Set Radio Future. Hideki Naganuma uses not only samples from the genres listed above - in the song ""Grace And Glory"" from the Jet Set Radio games he uses an opera sample. The official Jet Set Radio soundtrack, as well as the official Jet Set Radio Future soundtrack, includes all of his songs and several others.  Working alongside the same companies that created Jet Set Radio Future he contributed the entire soundtrack to SEGA's arcade skateboarding game, Ollie King. After a few years with his work absent from SEGA games, he finally returned in the SEGA production Sonic Rush for the Nintendo DS. A year later, he made a remix of Captain Straydum's ""Fuusen Gum"" for the anime Gintama. That same year, he composed the music for Air Gear under the alias of skankfunk. He would compose under this alias for most of his later works.  Read more on Last.fm.

39354,"My first song by LP was What I've Done, so I was a little late to the game.  

Remember I first heard the song when I was in Grade 7 from a band performance by some other guys in another class, they totally sucked (sorry) but funnily I found the song good enough to ask around my friends what song it was and who it was by.  

I remember asking like 10 people until I finally knew Linkin Park (I'm from HK and LP wasn't the biggest there back then in 2006).  Went home, jammed it, found more songs by them,  jammed more.  Downloaded HT, Meteora, Minutes to Midnight, cramped them all into my iPod nano.  Back then the Nano had only 128mb, so I couldn't fit anything else so it was nothing but Linkin park everyday for a straight year.  

Then I went to college in the states and gone through a year where I found out later was depression.  Never thought I would get it, didn't want to talk to anybody for days,  would rather starve until late AM just so I wouldn't meet anybody in the kitchen.  Didn't want to Skype my parents, didn't want to get out of bed to classes, grades slipping hard,  not even wanting to go partying (which I loved during Freshman year).

I didn't seek help at all since I didn't realize I was depressed at all at the time, I thought I was just not interested in school, but I was actually not interested in anything at all in life.  What got me through this period was the LP music I so so love; not because the lyrics were ""edgy"" or ""angst"" but my familiarity with them.  I owe them because they provided me with comfort where I don't need to give a single damn about outside life.  Thank you, Chester.

&gt; Fenix TX (styled as Fenix*TX) is an American pop punk band. The band originally formed as Riverfenix in 1995 in Houston, Texas. They released an EP, G.B.O.H., and an album, Riverfenix, on independent record labels, before having to change their name due to a cease and desist order from the estate of actor River Phoenix. Following the change of name, they signed with major label MCA Records in 1999. On MCA, they released two further albums, 1999's Fenix TX and 2001's Lechuza, which collectively sold over 600,000 units, prior to breaking up in 2002 over creative differences.[1]

&gt; After the split, bassist Adam Lewis and drummer Damon DeLaPaz devoted themselves to their now defunct side project Sing the Body Electric, while vocalist/guitarist Will Salazar and guitarist Chris Lewis formed the band Denver Harbor.

&gt; In September 2005, Fenix TX announced their reunion. They released a live album, Purple Reign in Blood, and supported it with tours across the United States and Japan. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; AlunaGeorge are an English electronic music duo from London, consisting of Aluna Francis (vocals and songwriting) and George Reid (production and instrumentation).The duo first met in June 2009, when Reid remixed Francis' band My Toys Like Me's track ""Sweetheart""

&gt; A lot of bands meet as kids at school. Others come together after an over-enthusiastic conversation about music at some random party. Aluna Francis and George Reid however, met through the internet.

&gt; While their online encounter is more MySpace than Match.com, it was in fact through a mutual respect for each other's work that led them to go on to form AlunaGeorge. Now together for just barely a year, the talented duo have been churning out a series of infectious mixes which fuse Francis' sweet vocal harmonies with the hushed electronic stylings courtesy of Reid.

&gt; Having already caught the attention of Rob da Bank who championed their initial collaboration Sweetheart on Radio 1; they've since succeeded in initially tapping the American market having had a track featured in the US series of Skins earlier this year. Now this month sees the release of their debut AA single Analyser/ We Are Chosen, two impressively mastered melodies of sensual synths complemented by Francis' contagious vocals which evoke notions of the likes of Shanks and Bigfoot, yet at the same time remain utterly unique.

&gt; The Damned are a punk rock group originally from Croydon, England, a suburb of London, who were formed in 1976. Despite being one of the definitive early punk bands they were also one of the most ambitious; with their later albums moving away from the breakneck garage sound of their debut and taking in elements from goth and psychedelia to prog and metal.

&gt; They are notable for being the first of the British punk bands to release a single, put out an album, and tour the United States. Their debut album, Damned Damned Damned, was released six months before The Sex Pistols' debut, Never Mind The Bollocks.

&gt; The Damned have dissolved and reformed many times, with singer Dave Vanian remaining the sole constant. They have incorporated many styles in their music, most notably garage rock, psychedelic music, the British theatrical rock of Screaming Lord Sutch and The Sensational Alex Harvey Band, and New Romantic. 

&gt; In addition to serving as inspiration for many of the young bands who created hardcore punk in the US, The Damned are also generally regarded as one of the founders of goth music.

&gt; Original members Dave Vanian (David Lett), Captain Sensible (Raymond Burns), and Rat Scabies (Chris Millar) were all members of the semi-legendary Masters of the Backside which included future Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.

&gt; X (later changed to X JAPAN in 1992 to avoid confusion with the American punk band X) is arguably one of the most influential bands in the history of the Japanese music scene. Formed by childhood friends Yoshiki and Toshi in 1982 at Chiba, Japan, X was originally founded to play high energy rock music. Besides being one of the first Japanese acts to achieve mainstream success while on an independent label, the group is widely credited for pioneering the visual kei movement. 

&gt; Their early music was speed metal, but later on they acquired a more symphonic metal sound.

&gt; The band consisted of Toshi (vocals), Yoshiki(drums, piano, composer, lyricist), hide (guitar), Pata (guitar), and Heath (bass), and Taiji (bassist) until 1997 when they disbanded. 

&gt; Once Yoshiki and Toshi recruited bassist Taiji and guitarists hide and Pata, the band began moving on the indie circuit. They garnished abundant support and fans across Japan with their outrageous dress style.
 
They used long, dyed hair and leather, along with makeup to make themselves shocking to the people who went to see them. This look, and their musical style of fast, driving metal, mixed with softer ballads, was the defining origin of today's visual kei band.

&gt; However, in 1996, after the release of their fifth and final album, DAHLIA, Toshi announced that he was departing from the band, for his own reasons - rumored to do with his wife disliking the band, his time commitment, and their performance of mostly sad, downbeat songs. Rather than go on without Toshi, the following year X JAPAN announced it was breaking up. At the end of the year, they had their final concert. X Japan split up in 1997.

&gt; Four months later, May 2, 1998, Hideto ""hide"" Matsumoto, X Japan's lead guitarist, was found dead, hanged  with a towel tied to a doorknob in his Tokyo Apartment. While authorities deem the guitarist's death a suicide, several of hide's friends and colleagues stated that they believed it an accident, this was supported by the fact that there was no suicide note.

&gt; However, a new wind has begun to blow for X JAPAN, as Toshi has stated his desire for a reunion for the 25th anniversary of the band's founding.

&gt; In March 2007, Toshi announced on his website that he and Yoshiki had recently resumed working together, stating that a ""new project"" would commence soon. An X Japan reunion was officially confirmed on June 4, 2007, with Yoshiki announcing a tour, as well as a new single (a re-recording of the song ""Without You"", originally from Yoshiki's 2005 solo album Eternal Melody II) to be underway and that he was in talks with Heath and Pata, regarding their participation. About ten undisclosed guitarists were to fill in for the late hide during concerts.

&gt; The band held its first live performance on October 22, 2007, on the rooftop of the shopping center Aqua City in Odaiba, Tokyo, during which a music video for the newly recorded song ""I.V."" was filmed. ""I.V."" also appears on the soundtrack of the movie Saw 4.

&gt; During 2008 the band made more lives appearances and on May 2 and 3, 2009, the band held two live shows at the Tokyo Dome. Both shows were completely sold out.  On May 30, the band did their first live show with Sugizo in Taiwan.

&gt; On January 9, 2010 the band made its first public U.S. appearance by shooting four new music videos in Hollywood. [61] The four videos were for Rusty Nail, Jade, Endless Rain and I.V..

&gt; On July 1, the band appeared at Club Nokia in Los Angeles where they performed an acoustic version of I.V., and recorded a music video of a new song, Born to be Free.

&gt; During the following month, X Japan and Yoshiki were featured in numerous newspapers and websites such as ABC News, the L.A. Times, and Chicago Sun-Times.  On August 8th, 2010, X performed at Lollapalooza in Grant Park Chicago, Illinois. 

&gt; On August 16, the first ever North American tour was announced with dates scheduled for Los Angeles, Oakland, Seattle, Chicago, Vancouver, Toronto, and New York City. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; .....Of BassBin Twins
Bassbin Twins were born in Los Angeles, moved to Belgium, and are now based in San Francisco. Started in 1992 simply because of a ""love for the beats"", they've recorded for Skint, Belgian Breaks, Southern Fried, and others, as well as their own numerous one off indpendent releases.

&gt; A live Bassbin Twins show is a remix of all their favorite music. Their innovative tunes range from breaks to house to drum 'n bass. Anything and everything can get woven into the mix. Eclectic in nature, the connection lies in the unique rub they put on each track.

&gt; The future for BBT holds more live shows, new fiercely independent record releases, and more film making projects. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Ghinzu is an Alternative rock band from Belgium. They were formed in 1999 by a group of musicians who had been on the Belgian rock scene for a number of years, named after a Japanese knife-brand. The current line-up consists of John Israel (also known as ""John Stargasm"") (vocals, keyboard), Mika Nagazaki (bass), Greg Remy (guitar), Antoine Michel (drums), Jean Waterlot (keyboard, guitar). Former members include Kris Dane (keyboard, guitar), Fabrice Georges (drums) and Sanderson Poe (contrabass).

&gt; Their first album, Electronic Jacuzzi, was released in December 2000 labelled by their own Label Company Dragoon and sales quickly topped several thousand. Recorded over several sessions in the spring and autumn of 1999 and 2000, it marks a turning point in contemporary pop and features 12 tracks that travel between groove and noise in an inimitable style.

&gt; The rhythm section is relaxed, radical and original, producing a soaring, elastic groove in perfect contrast to the sound of the guitar and doublebass. This adds a tragic quality to the elegance that the group exudes. This vicious aesthetic evokes the essential elements in pop: piano, trash synths, no-wave melodies and addictive rhythms that create a dramatic tension, bringing to the forefront the tragic necessity that drives rock. But this maturity allows for experimentation: bass duos, piano ballads accompanied by cutting breakbeats, distortions and self-deprecating humour, speed-pop and of course the noise holding it all together. It is modern music whose very conception demands a fresh approach to listening to and playing music. Ghinzu brings out the sounds of the instruments rather than playing them in the standard way.

&gt; The first two singles from the album are ""Dolly Fisher"" (a song about the possibilities of romance between man, plastic and voodoo dolls) and ""Electronic Jacuzzi"" (dedicated to dancefloor fetishists). ""Dolly Fisher"" was immediately put on the Radio 21 playlist before it was even released. This success was followed by several appearances on different Belgian TV stations and a tour that started in 2000 and finished in 2002, taking in around 50 gigs and a mini tour of Flanders.

&gt; Ghinzu released their second album, Blow, in February 2004, an album full of the soul that drives those who live rock as a passage to a different life. The pleasure of listening to this album is in losing yourself within the music and discovering the most incredible characters, the maddest adventures and the most poignant of destinies. An album made to move you without a second thought, in the same way that rock and roll is played. The lyrics exude a kind of venomous dandyism, a sarcastic yet tender vision that draws out social vignettes showcasing the heroes of daily sex and taunting the aristocracy. This exquisite finesse clashes with the controlled and jubilant anarchy of their concerts, as if to assert the undercurrent of the album.

&gt; Everyone has the right to boredom, and only a handful have the duty to fight it- Ghinzu is one of them.

&gt; In August and September 2003, Ghinzu played several festivals to try out their new compositions on stage with their new multi-instrumentalist Kris Dane. Kris has already proved his talents as a solo artist, and he strengthens Ghinzu on stage, playing keyboards and guitar as well as singing. These dates included very well received concerts at Nandrin Festival and the Nuits Botaniques.

&gt; Convinced of the talent and relevance of the group to the modern music world, they were signed by Bang! for distribution and Ghinzu returned to the studio to finish ""Blow"", after four years of sharpening their venomous dandyism.

&gt; Ghinzu was also selected by RTBF to represent Belgium in the European showcase festival ""Eurosonic"", which took place in the Netherlands on 9 January 2004. Following this gig, a number of foreign festivals in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK showed in interest in attracting Ghinzu.

&gt; 2004 was also the year of a sell out gig at the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels, where Ghinzu played together with two other bands (Girls in Hawaii and Sharko), which was covered by all the Belgian Media.

&gt; In the summer of 2004, Ghinzu played all the major national festivals: Dour, Nandrin, VerdurRock, Pukkelpop etc.

&gt; In Autumn 2004, Ghinzu played a French Tour of around 20 dates to promote their new album (released 7 September). The album was released under the 'Atmospheriques' label (Tarmac, Tahiti 80...), while Radical (Placebo, Moissec, Blonde Redhead) took charge of the French leg of the tour.

&gt; In 2005, Ghinzu started the new year with a tour of a few dates in the Netherlands (Venlo, Nijmegen, Tilburg, Den Bosch), where they had been eagerly awaited since the release of Blow and their appearances at several festivals the previous summer (Valkhofaffaire in Nijmegen, Zinin Festival in Utrecht).

&gt; This was followed by a second sell out gig at the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels on 26 January, this time all by themselves.

&gt; After another sell out gig at Paris' L'Elysee Montmartre on 1 February, Ghinzu played their first few gigs in Switzerland. Their tour ended with an invitation to participate in the Montreux Jazz Festival on 15 July supporting the.

&gt; Ghinzu is now in the process of winning over the European public by their irrepressible live performances, backed up by an album which has already made its mark. Before starting their summer festivals tour they will be playing the mythical Olympia on 13 June which has already sold out.

&gt; Indio is :

&gt; 1. ...the name of a side project of Detroit techno artist John Beltran. A self-titled album was released by the Transmat label of Derrick May in 1999, followed by two EPs. 

&gt; 2. the stage name used by Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Peterson.  He originally formed a band in his early musical career, but split up the band because he felt as if he had to restrict his music and make it conform to the limits and abilities of those specific band members.  He would rather choose his own set of band members for each individual track.

&gt; His only album, an eponymous released in 1989, yielded little success.  The most well known and well appreciated track is almost inarguably ""Hard Sun"", which was covered by grunge idol Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam and Temple of the Dog, in a brief solo project for the Sean Penn movie Into the Wild.

&gt; Indio's style of music is generally very rhythmic and often uses heavy sets of layered percussion.  He is also appreciated amongst his limited fan base as a staggeringly visual and talented lyricist.

&gt; Dispatch originated in the early 1990s as One Fell Swoop, but changed their name to Dispatch in 1996. Chad Urmston, Braddigan, and Pete (Francis) Heimbold, who were all attending Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont comprised the band's lineup throughout their entire career. Their music drew upon several influences, such as acoustic folk-rock, reggae, and funk.

&gt; Dispatch gained much recognition outside of New England, without any help from a label, and stuck together long enough to release seven albums, three of which were live performances. During concerts, the band had been known to improvise upon their album releases, often resulting in a song ending in twice the length of the original. The group was also fond of switching instruments and vocal duties when playing live.

&gt; Upon the announcement of its break-up in 2002, the band scheduled one final concert. The free show was performed at the Hatch Shell in Boston on July 31, 2004. ""The Last Dispatch,"" as it was referred, is said to be the largest concert in independent music history; roughly 110,000 fans from over 20 different countries attended the show. Parts of the performance were released as a CD/DVD two-disc set later that year, entitled All Points Bulletin, along with an earlier show in Somerville, Massachusetts.

&gt; All three of the band's members are currently still in the music industry. Urmston is now the frontman of State Radio, while Corrigan (now credited as Braddigan, a nickname by which he was known since his time with Dispatch) and Heimbold (now credited as Pete Francis, his middle name) are succesfully pursuing solo efforts.

&gt; After the song Elias, written by Urmston after his experience living and teaching in Zimbabwe, the ""Elias Fund"" was formed to send children from the ravaged country to college.

&gt; Dispatch came out with a movie entitled ""Last Dispatch"" in July 2005, which documents their final 12 days together as a band and tells the story of how they became ""the band that redefined independent music history"". The film was released and previewed in Boston. Chad, Brad, and Pete attended the showing and celebrated throughout the weekend with their fans.

&gt; On December 22, 2005, Corrigan helped to organize a benefit concert, known as the Relief Project, at Irving Plaza in New York, New York. Along with several other performers, Corrigan invited Heimbold and State Radio to play. The three reunited very briefly, playing the song Here We Go as an encore. Corrigan stated there that he plans further Relief Project concerts featuring all three and perhaps sometime in 2007, a major Dispatch reunion concert.  
Entitled ""Dispatch: Zimbabwe"", Dispatch arranged for one show in Madison Square Garden, with all the money sent towards relief efforts in Zimbabwe.  Originally billed as a one show deal on July 14, Dispatch was surprised how quickly this first show sold out and set two more shows for the 13 and 15. After all three shows sold out, Dispatch announced another smaller show on July 11th at Webster Hall in  New York, where they made their comeback debut to great success.  

&gt; Dispatch is now having a second set of reunion concerts beginning at Red Rocks amphitheater in Denver, Colorado on June 3, 4, and 5th,  2011. These performances will launch a reunion tour around the US and the release of their new Dispatch EP on May 17th. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; The Asteroids Galaxy Tour is a psychedelic pop band which formed in 2007 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The band currently consists of Mette Lindberg (vocals), Lars Iversen (bass, keys), Mikkel Baltser Dørig (guitar, keys), Miloud Carl Sabri (trumpet, keys) and Rasmus Valldorf (drums). Their debut album, Fruit was released in 2009 on their own Small Giants label. The band's single Around the Bend was featured in an iPod Touch commercial in December 2008. 

&gt; Speaking with Songfacts in an interview, Iversen explained how the song got in the Apple commercial: ""We have this company working for us in the States called Synch, and they got in touch with Apple. I think they had this meeting with Steve Jobs himself, and he picked that song out of the bunch and said, 'This is it, this is the new track for the iPod Touch.' Apparently he just loved that track, but we never saw it as one of our singles. We have some other songs that we thought would be great singles, and that would work cool on for the radio, but he really loved that song."" 
 
The Asteroids reached instant global exposure when their song Around The Bend was featured in an Apple iPod Touch advert in late 2008. Their music also appeared in US hit TV series Gossip Girl, CSI Miami as well as Chuck.
Around The Bend was also chosen as one of the key tracks to the R.J. Cuttler documentary ""The September Issue"", based on Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. 

&gt; Their song The Golden Age is featured in the latest Heineken advert The Entrance from 2011.

&gt; Their first show ever was as opening act for Amy Winehouse in their local Copenhagen and Katy Perry chose The Asteroids as opener for her European tour summer of 2009.
The band spend most of 2009 touring all around Europe and the US with their six piece live band which includes trumpet, saxophone, drums, guitar, keys, bass and more...

&gt; The press says:

&gt; Addictive quirky soulful Pop Music with attitude,
sweeping musical arrangements with one of the hippest vocals around, Known for their infectious live shows, shiny, shimmering, upbeat pop, albeit with a horn-infused, slightly psychadelic edge, C-walking, up rockin’ leg-splitting and hip-shaking their way through, infusion sound like no other,
effervescent music that reminds you of a dozen glorious summerskaleidoscopic monster, bubbly and hypnotic...

&gt; At the moment they are busy recording new material for future releases and getting ready for playing their ""FRUIT"" spring/summer tour around the world for festivals and club shows.

&gt; Chico Buarque (born Francisco Buarque de Hollanda, 19 Jun 1944, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - also known as Chico Buarque de Hollanda), is a singer, composer, dramatist, and writer, although he is best known for his music, which often comments on Brazilian social, economic &amp; cultural issues.

&gt; Chico came from an intellectual and privileged family background.  Sérgio Buarque de Hollanda, his father, was a well-known historian and sociologist.  Aurélio Buarque de Hollanda, his lexicographer uncle, is as strongly associated with Brazilian dictionaries as Webster is with American English ones. 

&gt; He was a studious child, precocious in music &amp; writing, and was heavily impressed by bossa nova - specifically, João Gilberto's work.

&gt; Chico made his public debut as musician and composer in 1964, rapidly building his reputation at music festivals and television variety shows. His self-titled debut album exemplified the work to come, with catchy sambas characterized by inventive wordplay and an undercurrent of nostalgic tragedy.

&gt; Chico's increasing political activity against the Brazilian military dictatorship resulted in his arrest in 1968, and eventual self-exile to Italy in 1969. Other important musicians like Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil experienced the same fate. Chico returned to Brazil in 1970, using his fame and song-writing skills to protest against the dictatorship. At this time his lightly-veiled protest single Apesar de Você (Despite you) somehow passed by the gaze of military censors, becoming the democracy movement's anthem. After selling over 100,000 copies, the single was eventually repressed, and all copies were removed from the market. Despite the censorship, songs such as Samba de Orly (Samba of Orly; 1970), Acorda Amor (Wake Up, Darling; 1974), and Vai Passar (It Will Pass; 1983) made Chico's continuing opposition blatant.

&gt; During the 1970s and 1980s, Chico collaborated with filmmakers, playwriters, and musicians in further protest works against the dictatorship.

&gt; In 1998, the carnival samba school Mangueira took Chico as its annual theme, winning first prize.

&gt; His latest book, Budapeste, achieved great critical acclaim and won the Prêmio Jabuti, a Brazilian literary award similar to The Booker Prize Award. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; K's Choice is a Belgian rock band from Antwerp. The band centers on siblings Sarah Bettens (lead vocals, guitar) and Gert Bettens (guitar, keyboard, vocals). They are joined by Eric Grossman (bass), Jan van Sichem Jr. (guitar) and Koen Liekens (drums).

&gt; Their music can be described as guitar-based singer-songwriter rock or folk-rock. It ranges from very delicate and intimate singer-songwriter songs to songs that are stronger, more active and louder. Sarah's smoky, enigmatic voice is the band's best known characteristic. In the seven years between The Great Subconscious Club and Almost Happy the music changed from raw and guitar-based to a more subtle and delicate sound. Sarah and Gert write most of the music and lyrics. Most of it is written separately. 

&gt; Sarah mainly tries to express ideas in her songs, and has a hand in writing silly and tongue-in-cheek songs. Gert has one big theme: losing the one you love. While most of the songs are easily accessible and open, some others are strange and incomprehensible. This led Sarah to comment: ""Listening to the lyrics in the first time, you may find it hard to understand their meaning. When you listen to them a second time you may sense a basic truth in these cryptic words. If you do so, please let me know.""

&gt; This band appeared in an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Doppelgangland) with the song Virgin State of Mind, leading to a boost in popularity.Their most popular song 'Not an addict' can be heard in the movie 'Wild things'.

&gt; K's Choice has a new album, Echo Mountain, with a March 26, 2010 release date. Read more on Last.fm.

Not sure how this remark was ""sardonic"".  I'm curious how you can put a fixed time span on persons turning around their character.  Two years... because what?  He hasn't done anything douchey in two years?  What steps has he taken to amend his wrongs?  What actions has he done to contribute to society?  IIRC he even said something at the end of his Comedy Central Roast about him going to try to be a better person.  

Look at someone like Chris Brown.  Chris Brown has a laundry list of abuse.  I'm sure I don't have to remind you how he beat the shit out of then girlfriend Rihanna.  To those of you who think, ""no big deal""...

He beat the shit out of her because his girlfriend saw a text from another woman while they were driving.  Threatened to kill her.  Threatened to continue beating her after they got home.

Now, he's got a documentary out called ""Welcome to My Life"", showcasing all of trials and tribulations.  Poor guy. But its been 2 years since his last incident, so he's back to normal status.

This is one of thousand of examples throughout the decades across all genres of celebrity status.  If Bieber, Brown, Lennon, Jackson, West, etc. etc. didn't have their celebrity status, they'd be douche bags.  This worship of famous people for simply being famous normalizes poor and destructive behavior, make it seem like its not only OK, but often ""cool"" to their millions of fans.

I get it.  Do I feel for Bieber?  Sure do.  I did crazy stupid shit as a teen and young adult too.  If i had tons of money and women throwing themselves at me at his age, its very likely I'd have done the same shit.  But because I feel for him, because I understand his reasons, it doesn't make his behavior acceptable.  

Staying off the radar for two years or talking about how you will change in the future doesn't magically get rid of that vinegary smell.  Its about actions, about doing.  

What has he done with intent to show people he's not a douche, to show people that part of his life is in the past.  Nothing.

&gt; Michael Joseph Jackson (born August 29, 1958 in Gary, Indiana, died June 25, 2009 in Los Angeles, California), often referred to as The King of Pop, is the biggest-selling solo artist of all time, with over 750,000,000 sales. Jackson is an inductee of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and double inductee to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. His awards include 8 Guinness World Records, 13 Grammy Awards, and 26 Billboard Awards. He is also credited for popularizing many physically complicated dance moves, such as the robot and the moonwalk, and has influenced and spawned a whole generation of a wide variety of artists including Justin Timberlake, Mariah Carey and Usher, among others.

&gt; Jackson's musical career began in 1967 as lead singer of The Jackson 5, when the group made their first recording with a local label before signing up with Motown Records in 1968. He made his first solo recordings in 1971 while still a member of the group. But it was Off the Wall (1979) which marked the start of his full-fledged solo career, and he formally parted with his siblings in 1984. In his solo career, Jackson recorded and co-produced the best-selling album of all time, Thriller (with worldwide sales over 100 million), received thirteen Grammy awards and charted thirteen #1 singles in the U.S. Throughout his four-decade career, Michael Jackson has been awarded numerous honors, including the World Music Awards Best-selling Pop Male Artist of the Millennium. He is also a double-inductee into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of The Jackson 5 in 1997, and in 2001 as a solo artist. He is also a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In the mid-1980s, TIME magazine described Jackson as ""the hottest single phenomenon since Elvis Presley"". He has had a notable impact on music and culture throughout the world while also tearing down racial barriers and paving the way for modern pop music.

&gt; From 1988 to 2005, Jackson lived on his Neverland Ranch property, on which he built an amusement park and private zoo for the enjoyment of economically disadvantaged and terminally ill children. In 1993 and 2003, separate accusations of child molestation that allegedly occurred in Neverland were made against Jackson, which drew intense negative media coverage. While he was never charged for the first case, Jackson was tried and vindicated in 2005 of the latter allegation, but moved out of the US shortly thereafter. He later returned to Las Vegas in early 2007. 

&gt; Over the past few years Jackson has made numerous public appearances including MTV Japan's VMA awards where he accepted the legends award; the World Music Awards where he accepted the Diamond Award for selling over 100 million records; James Brown's funeral where he paid tribute and delivered his sermon; and a fan appreciation event in Tokyo, Japan, where he also greeted troops at US Army base Camp Zama. In early 2008, Jackson issued Thriller 25th Anniversary, a critical, and commercial success that is currently the second-biggest selling album of 2008 with over 2.1 million copies sold worldwide.

&gt; On June 25, 2009, Jackson collapsed at a rented home in Holmby Hills in Los Angeles, California. The cause of death is currently believed to be cardiac arrest. At the time of his death, Jackson was scheduled to perform 50 sold-out concerts to over one million people, at London's O2 arena, from July 13, 2009, to March 6, 2010. During a publicity press conference, Jackson made suggestions of possible retirement.

&gt; In the hours following Jackson's death, his record sales increased dramatically. His seminal album Thriller climbed to number one on the American iTunes music chart, while another eight have made it into the top 40. In the UK, where Jackson would have performed less than three weeks after his death, fifteen of his albums occupied the top 15 spots on the Amazon music chart. Social music network website Last.fm also saw a dramatic increase in Michael Jackson plays per hour after the announcement of his death.

&gt; On December 10, 2010, a compilation album of previously unreleased material, simply entitled Michael, was released posthumously. Featuring guest performances by Akon, 50 Cent and Lenny Kravitz, the album was certified Platinum in 18 countries but received mixed reviews from most critics.  This was followed in November 2011 by Immortal, a remix album; in September 2012 by Bad 25, a 25th anniversary reissue of Jackson's 1987 hit album Bad; and by  Xscape, a second compilation album released in May 2014.

""First Hand Experience In Second Hand Love"" from *From Here To Eternity*  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/85bde6d16cb34800c86670001cfa3615.png) [album cover](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/5404caaae3ce4233c2b4a67177cf8d80.png)  

&gt; Giorgio Moroder (born Hansjörg Moroder on April 26, 1940 in Ortisei, Italy) is an Italian record producer, songwriter and performer, whose groundbreaking work with synthesizers during the 1970s was a significant influence on new wave, techno and electronic music in general. Particularly well known are Donna Summer's disco hits produced by Moroder, including ""Love To Love You Baby"" and ""I Feel Love"". Moroder also produced a number of electronic disco hits for The Three Degrees.

&gt; Often collaborating with lyricist Pete Bellotte, Moroder scored a number of hits in his own name including ""Son Of My Father"" in 1972 and ""From Here to Eternity"" in 1977 under the name Giorgio, and in the following year releasing ""Chase"", the theme from the film Midnight Express and sold well elsewhere. All were hits in the UK. The full movie score for Midnight Express won him his first Academy Award for best film score in 1978.

&gt; In 1985, Moroder worked with Phil Oakey, frontman of the popular synthpop group, The Human League, to make the album Philip Oakey &amp; Giorgio Moroder. The following year, Moroder collaborated with his protege Harold Faltermeyer (of ""Axel F."" fame) and lyricist Tom Whitlock to create the score for the popular film Top Gun (1986), with the most noteworthy hit being the Berlin classic, ""Take My Breath Away"", which went on to become a huge hit for the group.

&gt; He also scored other popular films in the 1980s including American Gigolo, Flashdance, The NeverEnding Story, Thief of Hearts, Electric Dreams, Scarface and Cat People(in collaboration with David Bowie). The latter score has recently regained popularity due to its use in the popular computer game Grand Theft Auto III. Moroder's ""From Here To Eternity"" and ""The Chase"" were also used in the Sony PSP game Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. 

&gt; In 1984, Moroder compiled a new restoration and edit of the famous silent film Metropolis and provided a new modern rock-and-roll soundtrack to the film. 
His song ""Tears"" was sampled and used as the basis of the DJ Shadow song ""Organ Donor"" on his 1996 album Endtroducing......

&gt; On September 20, 2004 Moroder was honored at the Dance Music Hall of Fame ceremony, held in New York, when he was inducted for his many outstanding achievements and contributions as producer. In 2005, he was given the title of Commendatore by Azeglio Ciampi.

&gt; In 2005, a great deal of his work (including the Cizeta-Moroder supercar he co-produced in the mid 90s with Claudio Zampolli) was used in the video game Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, and was the entire playlist of the Flashback FM radio station.

&gt; Giorgio Moroder is one of the numerous composers interested in writing the theme tune of the 2008 Bejing Olympic Games. This is not the first theme song Moroder composed for the Olympic games. ""Hand in Hand"" was regarded as the best ever Olympic theme song for the 1988 Seoul Olympics by former International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Juan Antonio Samaranch.

&gt; Moroder contributed to Daft Punk's 2013 studio album Random Access Memories, admitting that he had been a fan of their song ""One More Time"" before working with the group. His voice and story is featured on the album's track ""Giorgio by Moroder"". On the track he states, ""My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio."" Read more on Last.fm.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/66e4e3e210674226b43f0cadc9b67aae.png)  

&gt; Ween is an experimental rock group formed in 1984 in New Hope, Pennsylvania, United States when Aaron Freeman (Gene Ween) and Mickey Melchiondo (Dean Ween) met in an eighth grade typing class. Ween collected a large underground fanbase despite being generally unknown in mainstream music circles aside from their 1992 fluke hit “Push th' Little Daisies”. 

&gt; The band's style is eclectic, and while they could generally be referred to as rock, one of their defining tendencies has been experimentation with various styles incorporating a strong element of humor and absurdity. Both Gene and Dean are skilled multi-instrumentalists who overdubbed various instruments on their recordings, though they also record with the regular touring band.

&gt; Their earliest home recordings were anarchic and free-spirited, drawing on influences as far-reaching as Beatles, Queen, Prince, Butthole Surfers, The Residents and the lo-fi punk movement. Ween was often compared in their early years to other offbeat artists such as Frank Zappa and would always eschew such comparisons.

&gt; Ween was signed to Twin/Tone Records in 1989 and released their first album GodWeenSatan: The Oneness in the following year, a 26-track smorgasbord of wild eclecticism. 1991's The Pod became a fast fan favorite, as the duo's use of drum machines, pitch-tweaked guitars &amp; vocals and drug-laced humor became a trademark part of their sound. The Pod, according to Ween-lore, was written under the influence of Scotchgard, but this was later refuted by Gene and Dean themselves as being ""the most slime-bag thing we could think of."" The contraption on the album cover is not a Scotchgard inhalation device, but a bong-like device used to send marijuana directly to the brain by use of nitrous oxide, which was said to leave the user intoxicated for days, but nauseated. The cover of The Pod used the cover of the 1975 Leonard Cohen album, The Best of Leonard Cohen, but with the head of Mean Ween (aka Chris ""Cribber"" Williams, a friend of the band) wearing the mask, pasted onto that of Cohen.

&gt; Pure Guava, the first of a series of releases on the Elektra label, featured their highest charting single, ""Push Th' Little Daisies"" (1992) which gained them media &amp; MTV attention, as the video was a highlighted target on MTV's Beavis &amp; Butt-head. Chocolate and Cheese followed in 1994, heralding 70s pop/rock &amp; soul sendups such as ""Freedom of '76"" and ""Voodoo Lady"". The ""Freedom of '76"" music video was directed by Spike Jonze. At this time, Ween began to expand their live and studio line-up, providing both a crisper production sound in the studio and an easier live setup (up until this time, Ween had been using DAT tapes to provide backings for their songs).

&gt; Ween turned to Nashville studio musicians for the recording of the authentically-spirited 12 Golden Country Greats (1996) which only contained ten tracks. There are two theories regarding the title of the album. The first is that it refers to the dozen veteran Nashville studio musicians who played on the album. The second is that the band did indeed record twelve songs during the demo sessions for the album, but upon the removal of the tracks ""I Got No Darkside"" and ""So Long, Jerry"" (the latter of which was a B-side on the ""Piss Up A Rope"" single) they decided not to rename it.

&gt; The nautically-themed The Mollusk followed in 1997, demonstrating Ween's satirization, deconstruction, and appreciative mastery of genres including 1960's Brit-pop, sea shanties, Broadway show tunes, and especially progressive rock. Their desire to pursue alternate forms of media led to the MP3-only release Craters of the Sac (1999), presented by Dean for online download and free trade. Elektra Records released a live compilation entitled Paintin' The Town Brown: Ween Live 1990-1998 in 1999, followed by White Pepper (2000), their pop-themed album and final studio set for Elektra. The track ""Even If You Don't"" was made into a music video directed by the creators of South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Shortly after White Pepper Ween started the internet radiostation WeenRadio, which was awarded 3rd best internet music site by Rolling Stone.[1]

&gt; Ween also formed their own label at this time, Chocodog Records, which oversaw the release of several self-produced live sets. The aforementioned Paintin' the Town Brown, which was compiled and mastered by the band, was meant to be the first Chocodog release. According to Dean Ween, once the album was completed, Elektra realized the sales potential of the CD and denied Ween the right to release it through Chocodog. Later, Ween released the first official Chocodog album, Live in Toronto (a live recording from the 1996 tour, in which Ween performed with Bobby Ogdin &amp; The Shit Creek Boys). The limited-pressing CD, available exclusively through the band website, became an instant collector's item. Subsequent Chocodog releases (Live at Stubb's and All Request Live) were produced in higher volumes to meet demand. In 2005, the label released the first instalment of a rarity compilation series entitled Shinola, and announced plans to re-release the 1987 cassette tape by Gene, Synthetic Socks.

&gt; The two signed to Sanctuary Records in 2003 and released Quebec, their first studio set in 3 years. In 2004, they released Live in Chicago, a DVD and CD set that compiled tracks from three energetic live performances.

&gt; In February of 2006, they rented an old farmhouse and converted it into a working studio. After writing over 50 songs and recording rough versions through 2006, they picked through them, and, with Andrew Weiss as producer, re-recorded album versions. As of March 2007, they are recording final versions of what they have said to be about 20 songs. On May 22, 2007 they announced they will be releasing an EP entitled ""The Friends EP"" on June 8th. Dean Ween said the EP will be ""The ultimate party record, filled with good beats and good times. Perfect for your barbecue or doing bong hits or whatever it is that you guys do."" And also they announced the new album--entitled ""La Cucaracha""-- was released October 23, 2007 on Rounder Records, placing them on the same label as fellow Alternative Rock duo They Might Be Giants.

&gt; Ween came to an end in May of 2012 when Freeman announced the band had split to Rolling Stone Magazine.

&gt; In 2015 the band announced a series of reunion shows, starting with a three night stand in Colorado. In keeping with the prophecy, Boognish rose again.

edit: oh oh but i was trying and here's a thought that seems a little cliche and forced, but well, i forced myself to reach:  The Queen song ""we are the champions"" (not sure if that's the actual title) became synonymous with winning, and if you've ever won any kind of even *moderately* competitive championship you can attest to this, maybe even given voice to it. winning is fun.

the point was to show how strong the project is without the center-piece, so-to-speak.

a big deal about this project was how little drake was featured on it.. there are several songs he isn't even on (sampha's 4422, skepta interlude, etc.). i made this as an exercise to see its shape after we took the vocalist off of it. instead, we are left with a pretty amazing collection of instrumentals, features &amp; unique songs that were curated by Noah ""40"" Shebib, drake's producer.. an immense talent.

a lot of people felt drake ""phoned in"" his verses and features on this project (even more so on the newly released track, ""Signs"") so this was a way of extracting the lifeless drake vocals &amp; highlighting the strengths of this project.

&gt; La Dispute, formed in 2004, is five close friends from Grand Rapids, Michigan with a firm passion for the concept of music and art as a medium for making new friends. As a result, La Dispute makes (or strives to make) music that is both artistically, technically, and emotionally engaging in hopes of establishing legitimate connections with any and all interested people, while encouraging dialogue between those people and themselves about things in life that truly matter and that truly last. La Dispute also carries a firm passion for the relevance of a live show, both for the bands involved and for the people in attendance, and will go to the grave believing that the environment created when strangers come together despite their differences to celebrate one important thing is invaluable and should not under any circumstances be taken for granted.
Their style combines elements of post-hardcore and screamo in a very experimental way to something that can hardly be put into a single genre.

&gt; Sabac Red is a former member of the underground hip-hop group Non Phixion, born in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. His family moved to Brooklyn, NY when he was 4 years old.

&gt; Sabac began his journey into hip-hop as a b-boy and aspiring graffiti artist. At the age of 12 Sabac began exploring the art of emceeing. He would listen to the mix shows and memorize other MCs' lyrics. He would then make parodies of the song's using his own lyrics. Sabac would perform at block parties, school talent shows and anywhere there was music and a mic constantly battling other MCs and nurturing his craft.

&gt; While a freshman at Lafayette High School in Brooklyn, NY Sabac would promote parties and shows for artists such as Milk and Gizmo, Big Daddy Kane, Greg Nice and many other hip-hop legends.

&gt; While in school, Sabac found himself getting into trouble with the law. He had to do community service at the CityKids Foundation (http://www.citykids.org) where he ended up learning how to use his lyrics to express his pain and the things that were going on around him. He received training in Facilitation, Conflict Management, Public Speaking, Curriculum Design/ Implementation and much more. CityKids was and still is a place that develops young artists and leaders.

&gt; With help from his mentors Malik Yoba, Jamal Joseph and Alex Atkinson, Sabac had the opportunity to learn, create and grow with his peers who have become some of today's very successful artists including: Dash Mihok, Donald Fasion, Lauren Hill, Dule Hill, Mario Vasquez, and many more. Sabac began working at CityKids between school, touring and odd jobs. He worked his way up to become The Director of Programs at The CityKids Foundation. Sabac resigned from CityKids in 2004 to tour and continue to work on music.

&gt; After high school, Sabac went to recording engineering school where he got a degree in recording engineering. Sabac went on to work for Wild Pitch Records as the College Radio promoter. He also did street promotion for Nas' Illmatic and a number of artists in the 90s.

&gt; In 1995 Sabac hooked up with Ill Bill and there begin the relationship of what is now the legacy of Non Phixion. Non-Phixion was Ill Bill, Sabac Red, Goretex and DJ Eclipse. The group began to put out music independently and began touring the world on their own. Sabac Red and Non Phixion have performed in all of NYC's major venues and have done shows all over the world. Some of the groups Sabac and Non Phixion have shared the stage with include Gang Starr, Run DMC, Wu-Tang Clan, Rage Against the Machine, Mos Def, Hazen St., Ludacris, Black Moon, Boot Camp Click, Pharaoh Monch, Big Pun and Fat Joe, Cypress Hill, Necro, Q-Unique, The Beatnuts, Jurassic 5, Lordz of Brooklyn, Dead Prez, Beastie Boys &amp; The Roots and Vinnie Paz of Jedi Mind Tricks. In 2006 Non-Phixion called it quits although Sabac Red, Ill Bill and DJ eclipse will continue to work together on all upcoming projects.

&gt; Sabac released his debut solo album Sabacolypse ""A Change Gon' Come"" on the independent Psycho+ Logical- Records in June 2004. The album received great reviews and continues to sell units worldwide. In 2005 Sabac put out two powerful Mix CD's titled ""Freestyle and Demos Vol. 1"" and ""Sabac Red Presents The Collabo Collection Vol. 1"".

&gt; In 2005 Sabac moved to Oakland, California where he continues to lead workshops and train young people and adults.

&gt; Sabac is currently performing solo shows around the world as well as working on his next solo project, a CD/DVD Titled ""The Ritual"" due out 2007. He is also finishing up The Collabo Collection Vol. 2, which will be released right before ""The Ritual"". Sabac is planning a world tour for 2007 including places like Brazil, South Africa, South America and Australia.

&gt; Sabac Red is also the Academic Liaison for the Alameda Unified School District's R.I.S.E/Jetsetters program and designs curricula for middle and high school students. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; The Jacksons (formerly known as The Jackson 5, The Jackson Five, The Jackson 5ive or abbreviated as J5) was an American popular music quintet from Gary, Indiana, USA. The group, active from 1964 to 1990, regularly played from a repertoire of R&amp;B, soul, funk, and later disco. Considered ""one of the biggest phenomenons in pop music"" during the early 1970s, the Jackson 5 are also notable for launching the career of their lead singer, Michael Jackson.

&gt; The primary members of the group were all the sons of Katherine and Joseph Jackson: Jackie Jackson, Tito Jackson, Jermaine Jackson, Marlon Jackson, Michael Jackson, and Randy Jackson (see Randy &amp; The Gypsys). Joseph Jackson formed the band in 1964 and served as its manager, with Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and unrelated youths Reynaud Jones and Milton Hite comprising its original lineup. Within a year, Michael and Marlon joined the band, and Michael became lead singer as the group developed a following in the eastern and midwestern United States during the mid-1960s. Signed to the Motown label from 1969 to 1975, and to CBS Records (as ""The Jacksons"") from 1975 until their disbanding in 1990, the Jackson 5 were one of the most popular groups of the era and became the first recording act to have their first four major label singles (I Want You Back, ABC, The Love You Save, and I'll Be There) reach the top of the American charts. Several future singles, among them ""Mama's Pearl"", ""Never Can Say Goodbye"" and ""Dancing Machine"", were Top 5 pop hits and number-one hits on the R&amp;B singles chart. Most of the early hits were written and produced by a specialized songwriting team known as The Corporation™; later Jackson 5 hits were crafted chiefly by Hal Davis.

&gt; While not the first act considered a ""boy band"", The Jackson 5 is one of the earliest examples of the type as it is defined today: five adolescents specifically packaged and marketed by a record label for crossover pop success. Upon their departure from Motown for CBS in 1975, the Jacksons, were forced to change their name and trade Jermaine (who remained at Motown) for Randy. The group took control of their songwriting, production, and image, and their success continued into the 1980s with hits such as ""Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)"" and ""State of Shock"", and a highly successful 1984 Victory tour. The Jacksons officially disbanded in 1990.

&gt; History

&gt; Early works

&gt; The Jacksons were a working-class family from Gary, Indiana. Katherine, being a Jehovah's Witness, raised the children as such, while their father, Joe, was not of that faith. Their father, a steel mill employee who often performed in an R&amp;B band called ""The Falcons"" with his brother Luther, was a strict disciplinarian. Many of the Jackson children recall being severely beaten by Joe for misbehaving.

&gt; The children found an outlet in music, with elder brothers Jackie (born Sigmund Esco Jackson, 1951), Tito (born Toriano Jackson, 1953), and Jermaine (b. 1954) borrowing their father's guitar without his permission and playing along to the radio. Younger brothers Marlon (b. 1957) and Michael (b. 1958) were allowed to watch as long as they did not tell. Joseph eventually discovered that the older three boys were playing his guitar when one of the strings broke. Although he was furious at first, Joseph realized the boys had talent and began making plans to create a musical act for them.

&gt; In 1965, Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine began performing around the Gary area with two neighborhood children, Milford Hite (on drums) and Reynaud Jones (on keyboards), in a group called The Jackson Brothers. Joe Jackson served as the manager, at first only part-time, and then eventually quitting his job at the steel mill. Jermaine sang lead and played bass, and Tito played guitar.

&gt; In 1966, younger brothers Marlon and Michael, joined the group as its tambourine and bongo players. Already showing talent as a singer and dancer, Michael replaced Jermaine as lead vocalist by mid-1967. Shirley Cartman, Tito's junior high orchestra teacher, noticed the group's talents and served as an early mentor to the group, by then calling itself The Jackson Five.

&gt; During this period, the boys toured Indiana extensively, and after winning a major local talent show in 1966 with a rendition of The Temptations' ""My Girl"", led by Michael, they began playing professional gigs in Chicago, Illinois and across the mid-eastern U.S. Many of these gigs were in a string of black clubs and venues collectively known as the ""chitlin' circuit"", and the young kids sometimes had to open for strip teasers and other adult acts in order to earn money.

&gt; Shirley Cartman got the Jackson Five a record deal with Gordon Keith's local Steeltown label, and the group began making their first recordings in 1967. Their first single, ""Big Boy"", became a regional hit. During this period, Johnny Jackson (no relation) on drums and Ronnie Rancifer on keys replaced Milford Hite and Reynaud Jones.

&gt; The Jackson Five had a number of admirers in their early days, including Sam &amp; Dave, who helped the group secure a spot in the famous Amateur Night competition at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. The group won the August 13, 1967 competition during the Amateur Night showdown at the Apollo, impressing Motown Records artist Gladys Knight of The Pips. Knight recommended the group to Motown chief Berry Gordy, but Gordy, who already had teenager Stevie Wonder on his roster, was hesitant to take on another child act because of the child labor laws and other problems involved.

&gt; 
The Jackson Five's sound was influenced by many of the biggest stars of the 1960s, especially including family funk bands Sly &amp; the Family Stone and The Isley Brothers, soul pioneer Marvin Gaye, doo-wop boy band Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers, and soul shouters like Wilson Pickett, Jackie Wilson, Stevie Wonder and James Brown. At the time of their early success, soul and funk stars, especially coming from Motown Records, were among the most popular musicians; Motown had launched the careers of dozens of the decade's biggest stars, most notably Smokey Robinson &amp; the Miracles, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations, and Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes.

&gt; Influences

&gt; From these sources, The Jackson Five developed many of their vocal arrangement styles and dance movements. The group's multi-lead vocal style was inspired by that of The Family Stone, while young Michael adapted Jackie Wilson and James Brown's impassioned singing and dancing styles into his own.

&gt; Joining Motown

&gt; By 1968, the Jackson 5 were a headlining act for the All Star Floor Show at Chicago's The Guys' and Gals' Cocktail Lounge and Restaurant. From July 12 - 27, 1968, the Jackson 5 opened for Motown group Bobby Taylor &amp; the Vancouvers at Chicago's Regal Theater. Taylor was also very impressed with the boys, and he decided to make the commitment to bring them to Detroit and Motown. Joseph and the Jackson Five stayed on the floor of Bobby Taylor's Detroit apartment the night of July 22, while Taylor and Motown executive Suzanne de Passe arranged for the Jackson Five to audition for the label.

&gt; On July 23, the Jackson Five had their Motown audition, for which they performed James Brown’s then current hit ""I Got the Feelin’"". Berry Gordy was not in attendance, but the audition was videotaped and sent to him in Los Angeles. Gordy's initial reluctance to sign the group disappeared when he finally saw the boys perform. Gordy decided to sign the Jackson Five to Motown, and hosted a party at his Detroit mansion on November 25, 1968 to introduce them to the Motown staff and stars.

&gt; Motown began negotiations to buy out the Jackson Five's Steeltown contract, completing the deal in March 1969. By the summer, Bobby Taylor began producing the group's first recordings at Motown's Hitsville U.S.A. recording studio in Detroit. The early Taylor-produced Jackson Five records were all covers of both contemporary hits and Motown-standards, including Sly &amp; the Family Stone's ""Stand!"" and their famous rendition of The Miracles' ""Who's Lovin' You"", written by Smokey Robinson.

&gt; In mid-August 1969, Gordy moved the Jackson Five and Joseph to California, and he and Suzanne de Passe began the process of grooming them as the label's next big act, while the rest of the family remained in Gary. While looking for a house in California, Joseph, Jermaine, Tito, and Jackie lived with Berry Gordy, while Michael and Marlon lived with Motown star Diana Ross. Read more on Last.fm.

I initially felt the same way, that of course art is emotional. I think what I liked is that he fleshed out the idea that rock was more generic where country was so vivid and specific. And I did pick up the same thing you did, I think he said something to the effect of ""you can't write a good country song unless you're born in the south"" and something specifically about race, I think he said something about being Jewish too? Weird that he could be that specific.

If you like this, the rest of the RH podcast episodes are pretty awesome. Season 1 featured some very interesting insight on college spending spread over three episodes, two of which were my favorite, and this season had a really interesting episode about golf club tax breaks and another two episodes about the black rights movement including a fascinating revelation about the famous ""Foot Soldier of Birmingham"" that history has been telling wrong from the very beginning--with a kind of surprise ending.

&gt;Kim also said that she’s never seen “any violence whatsoever,” although the BuzzFeed story alleged that he slapped one woman with an open hand for being too friendly to a Subway employee. But she vividly remembers a bizarre punishment one of the girls, a 19-year-old, was subjected to when she didn’t perform sexually in the way Kelly expected.

&gt;Kim said that she and the girl were instructed by Kelly to “take off your clothes and act like you miss each other.” He got out his iPad and started filming, she said, but was dissatisfied by the 19-year-old’s performance. He told Kim to sit on the couch and took the 19-year-old into another room. Twenty minutes later, he called Kim in. Kim knocked in the proper way, then walked in to find the younger girl nude except for one of Kelly’s bigger pieces of jewelry, a heavy chain.

&gt;“He had his iPad recording and she was naked except for a big chain and she was running laps from one end of the room to the other,” Kim remembers. “She was running laps around the room and apologizing. She kept saying, ‘I’ve been bad, I’m sorry Daddy,’ shit like that. And I’m standing there and she starts apologizing to me.”

-R.Kelly married Aaliyah when she was 15 years old and he was damn near 30.

-He has a violent criminal history (he has battery charges against him)

-Has multiple allegations against him for sex with minors and has been sued for sexual harassment.

&gt; Starship is an American pop/rock band best known for their hits ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"" and ""We Built This City"" that operated from 1985 to 1989, reforming in 1992 although featuring just vocalist Mickey Thomas. In 1984, singer-songwriter Paul Kantner left the San Francisco, California group Jefferson Starship. His former bandmates wanted to continue with that name, but Kantner, as the last founding member of Jefferson Airplane, took legal action over the ""Jefferson"" name. Kantner settled out of court and signed an agreement that neither party would use the names ""Jefferson"" or ""Airplane"" unless all members of Jefferson Airplane, Inc. (made up of Bill Thompson, Paul Kantner, Grace Slick, Jorma Kaukonen, and Jack Casady) agreed.  The band then took the name ""Starship"". Keyboard player David Freiberg, who had been increasingly marginalized, left as well.

&gt; In contrast to Paul Kantner's more experimental and progressive rock direction, Starship moved towards a sleek arena rock direction reminiscent of contemporaries Foreigner and Journey. In 1985, the band, based primarily around dual vocalists Mickey Thomas and Grace Slick, released 'Knee Deep in the Hoopla' and immediately scored two #1 hits. The first was ""We Built This City"", written by the team of Bernie Taupin, Martin Page, Dennis Lambert, and Peter Wolf (producer), which was inspired by Bay Area rock n roll station KSAN-FM.

&gt; That song was trashed at the time by Kantner and later criticized by co-singer Grace Slick, and it was later declared to be the ""worst song of all time"" by Blender magazine. VH1 also named it the number-one ""Most Awesomely Bad Song"" on a top-50 countdown co-sponsored with Blender. However, it became something like a 'signature song' for Starship and has continued to receive major airplay. The band's second #1 was ""Sara""; no previous incarnation of Jefferson Airplane/Starship had had a #1 hit. 'Knee Deep in the Hoopla'  itself reached #7, went platinum, and spawned two more singles: ""Tomorrow Doesn't Matter Tonight"" (#26), and ""Before I Go"" (#68).

&gt; In 1987, ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"" was featured in the film 'Mannequin' and hit #1, although only Slick and Thomas (plus Craig Chaquico's guitar solo) appeared on it. This song made Slick the oldest female vocalist to sing on a number-one Billboard Hot 100 hit, at the age of 47 (a record that she held until Cher broke it at age 53 in 1999 with ""Believe"".) The following year, with the new members Mark Morgan (keyboard) and Brett Bloomfield (bass) added. the band's song ""Wild Again"" (which reached #78 on the Billboard singles chart) was used in the movie 'Cocktail'.

&gt; By the time 'No Protection' was released, bassist Pete Sears had left. The album went gold and featured the hits ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"" (#1), ""It's Not Over ('Til It's Over)"" (#9), and ""Beat Patrol"" (#46). In addition, the last song on the album, ""Set the Night to Music"", would later become a huge hit when re-recorded as a duet between Roberta Flack and Maxi Priest.

&gt; Grace Slick left Starship in 1988, having become disillusioned with the band's drift towards a strongly commercial pop image and swearing never to perform with them again. The revamped Starship lineup, featuring Mark Morgan (keyboards) and Brett Bloomfield (bass), released 'Love Among the Cannibals' in 1989. Finding their commercial prospects waning, the group finally disbanded the following year.

&gt; In 1992, vocalist Mickey Thomas revived the band, originally using the name ""Mickey Thomas' Starship"". Gaining some praise for his live performances, he changed the name to ""Starship featuring Mickey Thomas"". Lately, the band often refers to itself simply as ""Starship"", though with Thomas being its only consistent member. In September 2013, the group released their first new studio material in over two decades, putting out the tune ""It's Not the Same as Love"".

&gt; Blue Cheer is an American blues rock group of the late 1960s and early 1970s, who helped to pioneer heavy metal music. Based in San Francisco, original personnel were singer/bassist Dickie Peterson, guitarist Leigh Stephens, and drummer Paul Whaley. A power trio, the band was named after a variety of LSD promoted by underground chemist and Grateful Dead backer Owsley Stanley. This variety of LSD took its name from a popular laundry detergent. Their first hit was a cover version of Eddie Cochran's ""Summertime Blues"" from their debut album Vincebus Eruptum (1968). The single peaked at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, their only such hit, and the album peaked at #11 on the Billboard 200 chart.

&gt; The group's sound was hard to categorize, but was definitely blues-based, psychedelic, and very loud. The band has been subsequently acclaimed as an influence on garage rock, punk rock, heavy metal, and grunge. Julian Cope has written, ""In 1968, nothing but nothing in America and Britain sounded as brutal as Blue Cheer except for The Velvet Underground.""

&gt; The group underwent several personnel changes after the 1968 release of Outsideinside, and then through yet more changes during and after 1969's New! Improved! Blue Cheer (different guitarists on side 1 and 2). After Leigh Stephens was replaced by Randy Holden, formerly of Los Angeles garage rock band The Other Half, in 1968, Blue Cheer's style changed to a more commercial hard rock sound à la Steppenwolf or Iron Butterfly. For the fourth album Blue Cheer, Holden, who had left during the third album, was subsequently replaced by Bruce Stephens. Stephens later quit and was replaced by Gary Lee Yoder, who helped complete the album.

&gt; The new line up of Peterson, Ralph Burns Kellogg, Norman Mayell, and Yoder in 1970 saw the release of The Original Human Being and then 1971's Oh! Pleasant Hope. When Oh! Pleasant Hope failed to dent the sales charts, Blue Cheer temporarily split up.

&gt; From 1988 to 1993, Blue Cheer toured mainly in Europe. During this time, they played with classic rock acts as well as then-up-and-coming bands: Mountain, Outlaws, Thunder, Groundhogs, Ten Years After, Yardbirds, Danzig, Mucky Pup, Biohazard and others.

&gt; On the Nibelung Records label they released several albums. 1989 saw the release of Blue Cheer's first official live album, Blitzkrieg over Nüremberg. This album was recorded on Blue Cheer's first European tour in decades. The drum chair was then taken by Dave Salce; bass by Dickie Peterson; guitar by Duck McDonald.

&gt; 1990 saw the release of Highlights &amp; Lowlives studio album, comprised of blues-based hard rock, sometimes reminiscent of Aerosmith and the Rolling Stones, and several ballads. The album was produced by notable grunge producer Jack Endino. The line-up was Peterson on bass and vocals, Paul Whaley on drums, and Duck McDonald on guitars.

&gt; Blue Cheer followed up ""Highlights"" with the much heavier Dining with the Sharks. McDonald was replaced by German ex-Monsters guitar player Dieter Saller. Peterson was on bass and vocals again, and Paul Whaley was again on drums. Also featured is a special guest appearance by Groundhogs guitarist Tony McPhee. The album was produced by Roland Hofmann.

&gt; In the early 1990s, Peterson and Whaley re-located to Germany. Whaley still lives there. Guitar work has been handled by Duck MacDonald since that time. Blue Cheer are still active as of 2009. Peterson reunited with Leigh Stephens and performed with drummer Prairie Prince at the Chet Helms Memorial Tribal Stomp in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park in Fall of 2005, and their lively performance drew old rockers like Paul Kantner and others from backstage to observe. They did some recordings in Virginia in Winter 2005 with Joe Hasselvander of Raven and Pentagram on drums. Paul Whaley has since returned to the band as drummer. The group's 2007 CD, ""What Doesn't Kill You..."", features contributions from both Whaley and Hasselvander. In 2009, Peterson died in Germany, leading to the cessation of Blue Cheer.

&gt; Blue Cheer's video for Summertime Blues made an appearance in 2005 documentary Metal: A Headbanger's Journey, where Geddy Lee of Rush referred to the group as one of the first heavy metal bands.

&gt; The band have also been regarded as the godfathers of stoner rock bands like Kyuss, Fu Manchu, Nebula and Monster Magnet have cited their ""heavy-fuzz rock"" as a massive influence on them. Read more on Last.fm.

In that time they had two releases on Two Bucks Records, Rudendestiny Demo &amp; a split CD with Melbourne hardcore outfit King Brown.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/75c37c7bef574d9d9137fa9ee4668e7e.png)  

&gt; The momentum has been building for years, but now the time is finally ripe for Arkarna to emerge with a bang back onto the world's stage.

&gt; Arkarna, An outfit so ahead of their time, that the svengali behind the project, precocious engineering prodigy Ollie Jacobs, has been spending years perfecting his craft, working with the likes with Leftfield (mixing their seminal album Leftism), The Prodigy and Madonna rather than having his own name in lights.

&gt; His band first hit the scene in 1997 with the critically-acclaimed, platinum-selling debut album Fresh Meat, but after touring the world to thousands of fans, Ollie became disillusioned with the way major labels wanted to mould him, so went underground to make the kind of music that satisfied his soul - albeit for other artists.

&gt; Fast-forward a decade, and Ollie finally found a collaborator to meet his exacting creative remit in his quest to re-launch the vision for the band.

&gt; Step forward talented guitarist and songwriter Matt Hart. For the past three years, the pair have hunkered down in their north west London studio and now, they've finally completed the incendiary, ground-breaking album that they know will propel them to the forefront of today's music scene. Yes, Arkarna are back to claim their space on the dancefloor, moshpit and in discerning music lovers' record collections the planet over. No-one else sounds quite like Arkarna.

&gt; When Ollie and Matt first met, it was electric - literally. Ollie, a programmer and singer, who's been a producer at his dad's Queen's Park studio Rollover since he was 14, was on the lookout for someone to take Arkarna's electro-pop sound to the next level.

&gt; Then he met Matt, who left a lasting impression in more ways than one. A smalltown West Sussex boy with a big dream, Matt had studied music classically since his childhood, but recovering from a life-threatening bout of illness aged 15, he started playing rock guitar. Later, while studying a degree in music at the prestigious Goldsmiths University in London, he saw an ad for auditions at Rollover, and, ever ambitious, went for it.

&gt; Matt explains: ""When I went to meet Ollie, I was in a rush, it was chucking down with rain, and I didn't put a bin liner on my amplifier. I tried to mop it down when I got there, but when they plugged me in to play, it gave everyone an electric shock. So before I'd even played, I'd electrocuted half the band, haha.""

&gt; Ollie enthuses: ""When I saw Matt playing, I knew instantly that he had a magic about him that I needed in my creative journey. We ended up working on high end sessions work together, with the likes of Boyzone. But when I started dreaming up some new Arkarna material, Matt was a natural progression so it just developed from that.""

&gt; Now a genuine song-writing partnership, the self-confessed knobtwiddler and balls-out rocker were a marriage made in heaven and the rest will be electrifying history - but year zero is 2010.

&gt; Arkarna have already made global inroads over the past few years, soundtracking Levis ads in the States and, right now, they're the sound of one of the biggest-selling alcoholic drinks in Russia.

&gt; Arkarna's single So Little Time was also the theme tune to Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's TV show in the US of the same name. On top of that, track House On Fire has featured on legendary US comedy Friends, The OC and the soundtrack for movie Batman And Robin - more importantly, they've even been played on the caff stereo in EastEnders...

&gt; But the past is merely an extra super-powered spring for the turbocharged launchpad that is Arkarna's crowd-pleasing new long player.

&gt; A bold, cerebral but ultimately rump-moving melange of beat-stoked, tune-drenched, emotionally-charged songs, the new album may be seen by some as their comeback, but in many ways, it sees Arkarna wiping the slate clean, whilst not alienating their vast existing fanbase in Southeast Asia and Australia.

&gt; Not only that, the catchy-as-swine-flu debut single from their new album has been mastered by the legendary Chris Gehringer from Sterling Sound, who's recently polished releases from the likes of Yeasayer, Rihanna, La Roux, Keisha and 3Oh!3.

&gt; And that's before you even consider the video, which has been directed by promo geniuses DuckEye, who've previous made videos for the likes of The Fallout Trust, Zero 7, Sigur Ros, and Clayhill - and, without giving too much away, it's set to be a fruity worldwide internet sensation...

&gt; But back to the new album, and with a public appetite voracious for the likes of Pendulum and Muse, Arkarna's unique take on cinematic, BPM-savvy, electronic, stadium-friendly rock with killer melodies is perfectly timed to explode onto the dancefloors, festivals and arenas across the globe - as Matt explains, ""We fall into and cross so many of the genres that are really popular now, but we've still got our own thing going on, we always have. We've got to be true to our sound.""

&gt; Matt elaborates: ""The Arkarna sound is so distinct - no-one sounds like us. We've always thought it was important to incorporate a lot of musical flavours from the old stuff, especially, the dance elements, but time moves on and music progresses, it evolves, so it's important that you evolve with it. And that's what we've done.""

&gt; Ollie adds, pertinently: ""I think it's what naturally comes out and we sound completely different to anyone else - we're not a copy. It's got history behind it, but it's organic and not contrived. And it gets asses on the dancefloor!""

&gt; And what of those lyrics?

&gt; Ollie explains: ""They're just about what's going on inside my head, quite insular. They work on different levels though - I like people to take their own meanings from them. Sometimes they're not meant to make sense. But yes, a lot of them are about love, because it's one of those things you can't help writing about because it hurts like a physical thing sometimes and everyone can relate to it.""

&gt; Matt gives us an extra insight: ""A lot of it is beneath the surface, you can't take them at face value, they're more cerebral and intelligent, you have to read into them. It's not just cliches - they're more arty, less literal, more abstract. But they're all from experience.""

&gt; Preparations are already underway for the Arkarna live onslaught - for which we can only warn you to limber up or face serious injury. As well as a full-on, aural assault with a full live band, Matt and Ollie are also rehearsing their new set acoustically.

&gt; Matt elaborates: ""It will be quite a big surprise the acoustic stuff, as we're making it completely unique. When it sounds as strong as it does acoustically, it's going to blow everyone away with the full band. You can hide behind so much when it's electronic.

&gt; Grouplove is an indie pop band which formed in 2009 in Los Angeles, California, United States. The band consists of Christian Zucconi (vocals, guitar), Hannah Hooper (vocals, keyboards), Andrew Wessen (vocals, guitar), Sean Gadd (bass, vocals), and Ryan Rabin (drums). The band released their debut album, Never Trust a Happy Song, in September 2011, which was followed by Spreading Rumours, released September 2013. Both albums were produced by the band's drummer Ryan Rabin, who is the son of former Yes guitarist and film composer Trevor Rabin.

&gt; Hannah Hooper met Christian Zucconi late one evening on the lower east side of Manhattan. They had both been living in New York for years and had never crossed paths before. But from that night forward the two could hardly be pulled apart. Soon after their connection, Hooper was invited to an art residency in Greece on the island of Crete and Hooper insists ""without any hesitation"" she invited Zucconi to join her on this journey. ""Seriously, we had only known one another for a few days but are both so inspired and alive when we are together that going to Greece seemed like a magical and natural thing to do,"" recalls Zucconi.

&gt; On Crete, in a small remote mountain village, Hooper and Zucconi met the members of their future band ""GROUPLOVE"" a year before it was officially formed. Sean Gadd, a natural songwriter and guitar player, born and bred in London instantly bonded with the two eccentric New Yorkers. Their relationship became apparent through the music they were making day in and day out. Andrew Wessen, a pro surfer and musician from Los Angeles and his childhood friend Ryan Rabin, an accomplished drummer and producer, were also at the residency and quickly joined in with the musical trio. These five musicians make up the members of what we now know as GROUPLOVE .

&gt; Like all good things, the summer and the residency came to an end and the five friends scattered back to their homes all over the globe. With Sean in London, Christian and Hannah in Brooklyn and Ryan and Andrew in Los Angeles GROUPLOVE was faced with the challenge of what to do now. ""We all understood how rare it is for five strangers to feel as close as family and create passionate music together. We couldn't just return to Brooklyn and let the music we all made fade into a memory of that summer we had in Greece,"" explains Zucconi. Everyone pulled their funds together and Sean, Christian and Hannah made their way to Ryan Rabin's studio in LA to record their album. ""We seriously had the best time of our lives doing that record,"" says Gadd. And the result is an incredibly special album where soaring harmonies coupled with sweeping anthems lead you through their powerful journey. Like the members of GROUPLOVE, their music is diverse in influence and style but bonded together by an undeniably creative kinship.

&gt; Their experience back together and recording together was so potent that Hooper and Zucconi packed up their lives in Brooklyn and Gadd packed up his life in London and they all moved to LA to live and play their music.

&gt; ""We never could have dreamt this up,"" says Zucconi, ""but at the same time we're not at all surprised - GROUPLOVE is meant to be. Our story a testament to fate, and our music is something we are ready to share."" Read more on Last.fm.

Edit: For those of you [idiots] that are down voting me, are you honestly going to argue with science?

Emphysema is when the lungs lose their ability to recoil elastically when exhaling, also meaning that the lungs are more compliant, which causes the lungs to hyper-inflate, and the total lung capacity to increase above normal.

Cigarette smoke is the primary (and by a great percentage) cause of emphysema. The other known cause is to be that of having an alpha-1-AT deficiency. AAT deficiency increases the risk of developing emphysema, as the lungs are not as well protected from the infections that could arise as a result of tobacco smoke and other irritants.

""Twist and Shout"", with John Lennon on lead vocals, was the last song recorded; producer George Martin knew Lennon's voice would suffer from the performance, so he left it until last, with only 15 minutes of scheduled recording time remaining.

&gt;Lennon was suffering from a cold, and was drinking milk and sucking on cough drops to soothe his throat. His coughing is audible on the album, as is the cold's effect on his voice. Even so, he produced a memorable vocal performance: a raucous, dynamic rocker. He later said his voice was not the same for a long time afterward, and that ""every time [he] swallowed, it felt like sandpaper"".[11]

&gt;A second take was attempted, but Lennon had nothing left and it was abandoned.[12] George Martin said, ""I did try a second take ... but John's voice had gone.""[13]

The tragedy I find in this is that their suffering was their source of inspiration as well as their untimely demise. (The death of a pop musician does not have the same resonance IMO.) Their pain in the music was what I connected with; it was what I was consuming when I listened to their music. Every time they sang those songs, they probably relived the pain underlying those lyrics. So part of my grief is guilt from this, even though I know artists willingly suffer and sacrifice for their art. ",Music

&gt; Trzy Korony (meaning three crowns) was a short-lived Polish rock band formed by Krzysztof Klenczon in 1970 after his departure from the most legendary Polish 60s rock band Czerwone Gitary. The group released a couple of singles and one album Krzysztof Klenczon i Trzy Korony. The band disbanded shortly thereafter and Klenczon left Poland to live in Chicago, US.

&gt; The band's most famous song is 10 w skali Beauforta (10 Beaufort), originally rehearsed and recorded by Czerwone Gitary, but it is this band's version that is considered definite and is most well-known.

&gt; Julia Stone is a singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist from Newport, Australia. She's part of the siblings Angus &amp; Julia Stone.  Following four years of critically acclaimed collaboration with brother Angus, Julia Stone's The Memory Machine marks her first foray into solo musical terrain. With the global success of the duo’s first two albums and accompanying sell out tours, Julia’s debut solo album demonstrates a musical confidence and story-telling capacity that reflects her evolution as an artist.

&gt; On The Memory Machine Julia employs the talents of a range of musicians from her musical community and undertakes production duties alongside co-producers Keiran Kelly and Brad Albetta.

&gt; Subtle, minimal arrangements show the self-assuredness that Julia has brought to this timely project and though characteristically sweet and melodious, the subjects of her stories often run to the darker side, reflected in the artwork inspired by old horror flick posters. Written and recorded over five months in a variety of locations these songs comprise a journey of their own.

&gt; Her songs can comfortably inhabit the surreal, where love is an unreliable latchkey kid (‘Where Does the Love Go?’); an internal dying fire warms the hands of grasping sycophants (‘Lights Inside this Dream’); My Baby harks back to the sweet serenades of the fifties and ‘Catastrophe’ provides a delightful romp through the disasters of clumsy connections. The title track, ‘The Memory Machine’, is a paean to lost love from a simpler era with Julia’s hushed vocal veering into dreamy longing.

&gt; Julia Stone’s talents as a musician are evident, providing not only vocal and guitar, but also piano, bass, ukulele and percussion, though it is Julia’s characteristic and unique vocals that shine here. She works as an professional artist since 2006. 

&gt; The Memory Machine is an intriguing, disturbing, moving and ultimately enchanting solo debut from an accomplished and self-assured artist. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; William Elliott Whitmore (born May 11, 1978, Iowa, United States) is an American blues singer and musician from Lee County, Iowa. He has recorded a number of albums released on Southern Records, and now is a member of the Anti Records family. His act consists mostly of playing the banjo or guitar while singing, though on occasion he performs a cappella. While he has earned much acclaim from the folk, blues and alt-country communities, he is also rooted in the hardcore punk community, by paying, for example, a homage for the worldwide spread icon of Bad Religion.

&gt; Hailing from a horse farm along the banks of the mighty Mississippi River, Whitmore has developed an intense love and spiritual understanding of the land, which he flawlessly conveys through his second Southern Records release, Ashes To Dust.

&gt; With a voice that sounds decades older than he is and full of emotional depth, William again delivers his unique signature style. While comparisons to the gravely voice of Tom Waits and the lyrical story telling of Johnny Cash fly throughout reviews of William's music, all agree that this Iowan is onto something more than just regenerating the music of the past.

&gt; Perhaps one of the reasons can be found in the instrumentation William uses in recording his songs, relying mostly on the basics while allowing his vocal delivery to provide a true sense of rural being. But clearly, it is heard in his stories: personal stories of death, love found and then lost, to never be found again. ""Midnight"", the opening track for instance, was born out of the feeling of displacement. ""Diggin My Grave"" which originally appeared on a limited edition self-titled cd, speaks of the need, for some reason or another, to kill yourself slowly. ""Lift My Jug"" (songs for Hub Cale) is a song of the first, honest to god hobo he ever knew and how meeting him at the young impressionable age of six, greatly influenced his life. The closing track, ""Porchlight"", is the story of William's father, one of a dying farmer's last request.

&gt; With live performances of a caliber to leave one completely stunned in silence, and an album full of songs not only from the heart but also from the heartland, William Elliott Whitmore's Ashes to Dust is one of the most interesting contributions to today's diverse collection of musical ingenuity.

&gt; Whitmore has toured with Chris Cornell, City and Colour, The Pogues, Murder By Death, Clutch, Lucero, Converge, Red Sparowes, Modern Life is War, Frontier Ruckus, Frank Turner and The Low Anthem.

&gt; Whitmore's 2009 release, Animals in the Dark, reached #50 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; English:
Stracené ráj is a band from Mezice, Czech Republic (although we should say Moravia, or better Haná). From the beginning in year 1994 they're playing only their own songs. Musical styles covers from some kind of folklore and hard blues to bigbeat, rock and metal. As the band is from region called ""Haná"", all their lyrics are in ""Haná"" dialect, which makes them really unique.

&gt; 
Hanácke:
Je kapela z Mezec kósek od Olomóca. Od vzniko v roko 1994 hraje jenom pisničke z vlastni tvorbe. Ze začátko bele aji nejaky česky, ale včel ož jeno hanácke otextovany. Žánrové záběr je veleké, od najakyho folkroko přes bigbit, tvrdy blues až po metal. Tade se tamo řiká hanácké bigbit. Všechno hanácke.

&gt; Složeni kapele je:
Prvni kytara a zpěv:               Marek Veróbal
Drohá kytara a zpěv:               Karel ""Koodl"" Ošťádal
Basa a zpěv:                       Marek Ošťádal
Klávese, akordeon a zpěv:          Lukáš Mikolka
Bobne:                             Tomáš Otěkalu

&gt; Kapela za dobo své eksistence vedala dvě demo CD. První v roko 1996 s 11 pisničkama a drohy v roko 2000 se 12 pisničkama. Meze leďma se o rozšéřeni postarale hudebni piráti. V roko 2007 vešlo posledni třeti CD. Toto cédo je oficiálni cédo Stracenyho Rája. Je na něm 13 pisniček, videoklip a fotke z natáčeni ve studio

&gt; A pro jistotu i něco česky:
Skupina Stracené Ráj je hanácká kapela se vším všudy. Převážná většina písní je otextovaná v hanáčtině a její členové jsou nefalšovaní hanáci ze samého středu hané. Jediní na světě, žádný folklór, ale bigbit. Read more on Last.fm.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/b09fcef17a7f41f8a8c08d8b834a3d93.png)  

&gt; Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band are generally regarded as one of the best live bands ever. Famous for their extremely long concerts, the band is well-respected throughout rock. Note that only live recordings can be credited to Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band. The official artist credit for all of Bruce Springsteen's studio recordings (even for those recorded with the E Street Band as his studio band) is Bruce Springsteen.

&gt; Since forming in 1972, the band's members have changed; however, core members include saxophonist Clarence Clemons, organist Danny Federici, bassist Garry Tallent, drummer Max Weinberg, pianist Roy Bittan and, of course, guitarist/singer/songwriter Bruce Springsteen. Guitarist Steven Van Zandt joined the band while recording Born to Run and made this record at least possible. He became one of the most honored and most influential members.

&gt; Other musicians important to the band include guitarist Nils Lofgren (who stepped in after Van Zandt quit); guitarist/singer Patti Scialfa (who is also Springsten's wife); and pianist David Sancious and drummers ""Mad Dog"" Vini Lopez and Ernest ""Boom"" Carter, who all had left the band prior to Born to Run. Also, The Rising tour saw the official addition of violinist Soozie Tyrell. 

&gt; In 1989 the band split up, after the massive success of the Born in the USA tour and the quieter Tunnel of Love tour. However, in 1999, the band reunited and embarked on a rather successful 18-month reunion tour - the ""E-United Tour"" - and now were powered by three guitars (Springsteen, Van Zandt and Lofgren, with Scialfa usually playing a fourth, acoustic guitar). 

&gt; Following the events of September 11, 2001, Springsteen and the Band embarked on their first studio recordings (excepting a short recording session for Springsteen's 1995 Greatest Hits album) since 1984's Born in the U.S.A. The band recorded The Rising in 2002, and then hit the road for another marathon, two-year tour. 

&gt; After The Rising, Springsteen recorded two more albums without the E Streeters followed by ""Magic"", released in October 2007 and featuring the hit single ""Radio Nowhere"". Magic was followed up by a traditionally strong tour throughout 2008, during which original band-member and friend Danny Federici passed away. Federici had already been temporarily replaced by Charlie Giordano, with whom Springsteen played the year before during the Seeger Sessions. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band rounded the 100-show tour at Harley-Davidson's 105th anniversary celebration.

&gt; On January 27, 2009 Springsteen's twenty-fourth album ""Working on a Dream"" will be released. According to the official press release, Working on a Dream was recorded with the E Street Band and features twelve new Springsteen compositions plus two bonus tracks. It is the fourth collaboration between Springsteen and Brendan O'Brien, who produced and mixed the album. A new tour for 2009 is expected to be announced soon. Springsteen and the E Street Band will play The Super Bowl halftime show on February 1, 2009.

&gt; Saturday 27th July 2009 saw Bruce and the E-Streeters played The Glastonbury Festival, England. This was the band's first-ever UK festival performance, a total of 135,000 people watched an epic, two-and-a-half hour headlining set.

Those lyrics feel different in today. On the rare occasion I listened to Linkin Park recently, it was usually nostalgic fun and I didn’t really take the lyrics seriously. But damn, I guess those wounds really didn’t heal, not even 17 years after the album. And maybe this is a little reminder to take people seriously when they say that they’re hurting, even if it doesn’t make sense. Even if it feels a little ridiculous. Even if it’s easier to make fun of them.",Music

53427,"Gah, I had a long reply that I was working on but I accidentally hit ""home"" and killed it.  Oops.

I've been enjoying talking about this too! Always interesting to toss these ideas around!  I do agree that there is a certain appeal to human ears in, say, a melodic note on the piano that isn't necessarily there in the same way for the shrill shriek of a dog whistle.  I don't think it makes the piano note objectively ""good"" though, and I also don't think it makes it impossible for the dog whistle to show up in music.  My view of objectivity is that, in order for something to be objectively true, it must be true independently of humanity.  For instance, the fact that the moon exists is objectively true as it's there.  The fact that the moon is pretty is subjectively true.  I ultimately think that beauty and irritatingness fall way on to the subjective side in that there's no intrinsic quality of beauty attached to the sound waves of a piano note, just like there's no intrinsic quality of annoyingness attached to the dog whistle.

Dissonance and consonance combined may profoundly affect people in one way, but other types of music affect them in other ways.  For instance, ambient music may totally abandon those ideas depending on which ambient music it is.  It may still profoundly affect people, however, in that it may conjure a powerful and almost visual sense of atmosphere (like looking at a painting of a marsh, or being immersed in some bizarre, surreal world) or it may relax the listener in to an almost trance-like state, and leave them feeling refreshed and cleansed as if the music had given their brain a rejuvenating rinse and massage.

Jazz is another good example.  It strays away from tightly structured melodies and seeks to unleash the human creativity of the players.  So the chords are often sort of open, allowing for plenty of melodic freedom for the improvisers.  Jazz most definitely can have a powerful effect on listeners in that listening to jazz is like listening to creativity in its pure form; straight from the mind of the player to your mind.  Or, as a great reddit submission once put it, it's like an artistic tribute to the human mind's ability to create beauty.  

In reference to the dog whistle...I've read about this woman who makes musical compositions out of that high pitched squealing sound you get when you pinch the airhole of a balloon and let a little air deflate out.  I don't like her music, but some people think it's great abstract art and/or fun and playful.  

A less extreme example would be the dog whistle sound at the end of Sgt. Pepper.  It's certainly a harsh noise but it works within the artistic context--I think it adds to the album's overall vibe of exploring new musical ideas and challenging established ideas of music.  Another good example is the high pitched guitar ""whale song"" shrieks in Pink Floyd's ""Echoes.""  Within that musical context (backed by atmospheric, otherwordly sound effects and in the middle of a dreamy song about the ocean), they sound like some incredibly surreal, otherworldly, powerful form of poetry.  They've got nothing to do with traditional musical structure, notes, or harmony, but they certainly can have a powerful effect.

I get troubled by my own views on music sometimes.  Am I accepting a view of music that basically abandons the idea of quality standards and accepts everything?  Am I accepting the possibility of a future where some guy farts in to a tape recorder, loops it for 46 minutes, adds some scrambled sounds from an infomercial and dissonant chords, and releases it as a postmodern work of art?  

Maybe.  But I think this is where your thoughts on how the human mind reacts to sound come back in to the picture.  It's true that any sound can be music, but it doesn't mean that any sound can be music that many people will actually connect with or get any value from.  And I think it's true that the farther away an artist strays from musical tradition, the more listeners they will lose and the fewer minds will find value in what the artist is saying.  But I don't think the quality of art is defined by how many people are able to connect with it.  I think the quality of art is like the quality of food--subjective.  And each mind finds the music that speaks to it the most powerfully.  I think the fact that so many different types of music connect powerfully in so many different ways with so many people is an indication that musical quality is subjective, and it depends on what you're looking for in a musical experience.",Music

&gt; Francis Albert Sinatra (born December 12, 1915 in Hoboken, New Jersey; died May 14, 1998 in Los Angeles, California) was an Italian American Grammy Award winning jazz singer, Academy Award winning actor, founder of Reprise Records and member of The Rat Pack. Beginning his musical career in the Swing Era along with Harry James and Tommy Dorsey, Sinatra became a highly successful solo artist, releasing 59 studio albums and becoming the idol of the 'bobby soxers'.

&gt; His professional career had stalled by the 1950s, but it was reborn in 1954 after he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He signed with Capitol Records and released several critically lauded albums (such as In the Wee Small Hours, Songs For Swingin' Lovers, Come Fly With Me, Only the Lonely and Nice 'n' Easy). Sinatra left Capitol to found his own record label, Reprise Records (finding success with albums such as Ring-A-Ding-Ding, Sinatra at the Sands and Francis Albert Sinatra &amp; Antonio Carlos Jobim), toured internationally, and fraternized with the Rat Pack and President John F. Kennedy in the early 1960s. Sinatra turned fifty in 1965, recorded the retrospective September of My Years, and scored hits with ""Strangers in the Night"" and ""My Way"". Sinatra attempted to weather the changing tastes in popular music, but with dwindling album sales and after appearing in several poorly received films, he retired in 1971. Coming out of retirement in 1973, he recorded several albums, scoring a hit with ""(Theme From) New York, New York"", and toured both within the United States and internationally until a few years before his death in 1998.

&gt; Sinatra was born in Hoboken, New Jersey and had three children; Nancy, Frank Jr. and Tina by his first wife Nancy Barbato. He was married three more times, to the actresses Ava Gardner and Mia Farrow and finally to Barbara Marx, to whom he was married at his death.

&gt; Sinatra is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide. He was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983 and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. One of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century, Sinatra had a popularity that was later matched only by Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Michael Jackson. American music critic Robert Christgau called him ""the greatest singer of the 20th century"".

&gt; On October 13, 2013, Croll released the song ""Home"" on his own VEVO channel on YouTube.

&gt; Stone Sour is a three time Grammy Award-nominated American alternative metal/hard rock band from Des Moines, Iowa, USA. The band was founded by Corey Taylor, also the vocalist from Slipknot, and former drummer Joel Ekman.

&gt; Early days
Taylor's long time friend, Shawn Economaki, joined shortly after, and filled in as the bass player. The band had played clubs and bars with different guitarists - often filling the position for just one show. This time, Stone Sour recorded 2 demo tapes, in 1992 and 1994. Shortly after, in 1995, James (Jim) Root - who is now also part of Slipknot with Corey Taylor - joined the band. The group was complete, and in 1996 recorded another demo tape, and songs from which would later be used in 2002 on their self titled debut album, Stone Sour. The band was named after an alcoholic drink that consists of one part whiskey, one part orange juice, with a splash of sour mix.

&gt; In 1997 the band went on hiatus when Taylor and Root spent most of their time with Slipknot, who were another up-and-coming act in Des Moines at the time who were to soon earn a record deal. Jim Root also joined the band a year later, and Economaki went on to become their stage manager. Ekman stayed in Des Moines, and formed a family.

&gt; Debut album (""Stone Sour"")
The band recorded their debut self-titled album in Cedar Falls, Iowa, which was released on 31 July 2002 in the UK, and on 1 August in the US. Aided by the song ""Bother"" which was featured on the Spider-Man soundtrack (credited only to Taylor), the album went on to become Gold. The band toured for six months with label mates Sinch and Chevelle before going on a temporary hiatus as Taylor and Root went back to join Slipknot for another album and tour.

&gt; Come What(ever) May, live album, and another hiatus
The band came back in 2006 to release their second studio album, Come What(ever) May. They parted ways with drummer Joel Ekman to be with his nine year old son Issac Ekman who was diagnosed and died from brain cancer and later recruited current drummer, Roy Mayorga of Soulfly. The album was released on August 1, 2006. It was met with mediocre reviews from critics, and sold 8 million copies in the first week, allowing it to debut at number four on the Billboard 2000. The band toured for the next year and a half, releasing the Live in Moscow album exclusively to iTunes on August 14, 2007. Corey Taylor and James Root returned to Slipknot to record their fourth full length studio album, All Hope Is Gone. Mayorga is now performing with the band Black President. While on the road with Slipknot, Taylor and Root are said to be writing along with Roy writing while doing the Black Presidents gig for the next Stone Sour album.

&gt; Audio Secrecy
As of 12th January 2010, Stone Sour had re-entered the recording studio to record their 3rd album, the first in four years. It was recorded and produced by the band and Nick Raskulinecz (a Grammy Award winning producer: Foo Fighters, Velvet Revolver, Rush, Alice In Chains; also produced their 2006's gold certified Come What(ever) May) at Blackbird Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. On June 10, the band released a free download of ""Mission Statement"", which was later released as a single on iTunes. The first official single, ""Say You'll Haunt Me"", however, was released on July 6, 2010. The album was released on September 7, 2010 on Roadrunner Records. Audio Secrecy is also the first studio album by Stone Sour that does not feature a spoken word track, with ""Omega"" and ""The Frozen"" on Stone Sour and Come What(ever) May, respectively (however, ""The Frozen"" was a bonus track).

&gt; House of Gold &amp; Bones
The Absolute Zero Songfacts reports that Stone Sour's fourth long-player, House of Gold &amp; Bones - Part 1, is the first part of a double concept album (the 2nd part is obviously titled ""House of Gold &amp; Bones - Part 2""). The two records are about a young man struggling with growing up. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Ric Ocasek (born Richard Otcasek on March 23, 1949) is the vocalist and frontman for The Cars and a producer for several other groups, including Bad Brains, Suicide and Weezer.

&gt; Ocasek released his first solo album in 1982. Beatitude is a somewhat more experimental variation of The Cars' New Wave rock sound. A more synthesizer-heavy follow up, This Side Of Paradise, was released in 1986. A minor hit, ""Emotion In Motion"" accompanied the album.

&gt; The Cars split in 1987, and Ocasek disappeared from the public eye for several years, resurfacing in 1990 with Fireball Zone. One track, ""Rockaway"", enjoyed a brief stay on the charts, but his solo albums have seen disappointing sales, especially compared to his success with the Cars. He subsequently released other solo works throughout the decade, including 1993's Quick Change World, 1996's Getchertikitz (a collaboration with Suicide's Alan Vega), and 1997's Billy Corgan-produced Troublizing (which Ocasek supported with a very brief tour, his first since leaving the Cars). In 2005, Ocasek released another album, Nexterday, to little fanfare but positive reviews.

&gt; In 2010, Ocasek reunited with the surviving original members of The Cars to record their first album in 24 years, titled Move Like This, which came out on May 10, 2011. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Agalloch was an American metal band formed in Portland, Oregon, United States in 1995. On May 13th, 2016, Agalloch announced their disbandment. John Haughm released the following statement regarding the status of Agalloch:

&gt; ""After being inundated by a barrage of responses, I feel that I should clarify some things. I take full responsibility for the decision to part ways with the other guys. It was difficult, well thought-out, and something that had been culminating over the past couple of years. I simply could not continue any further with the band as it was. I had to make a change as my motivation and inspiration had started to completely deteriorate. Whether this is the permanent end of Agalloch altogether or a possible fresh start, I don't know. I probably won't know for awhile. The band has simply been reduced back to its founding, visionary member for the first time in 20 years. Beyond that, the future is unknown.""

&gt; For twenty years the Pacific Northwest group defined what it means to combine influences from a variety of musical genres into one brooding, colossal, and cinematic sound that provides the soundtrack to existential themes concerning man, nature, loss, and death.

&gt; After two demo releases in the late 90s the band released three full-length albums: Pale Folklore (1999), The Mantle (2002), and Ashes Against the Grain (2006). “The Mantle” has since been heralded as a classic for having been one of the first albums to combine elements from black metal, neo-folk, progressive rock, post-rock, and ambient music. The influence of this record can be heard in many so-called “post-black metal” bands today.

&gt; In 2008 Agalloch began re-releasing their demos, B-sides, and EPs under their own Dammerung Arthouse label. In 2010 their fourth album Marrow of the Spirit made number one on numerous critic’s top ten lists. In between each of these full-lengths the band pushed on the flexible boundaries they had developed around themselves through a series of EPs that found the band experimenting with post-rock/instrumental rock (The Grey, 2004), neo-folk/psychedelic folk (“The White EP, 2008) and a mammoth twenty-minute epic work entitled Faustian Echoes (2012) released through Dammerung Arts. Their fifth and last full-length album The Serpent &amp; the Sphere (2014) has continued to earn praise for solidifying the now identifiable sound of the band.

&gt; Agalloch earned a reputation for explosive and emotional live performances. They sold out tours across Europe and the US and played a variety of major international festivals including: Roadburn, Inferno, Ragnarok, Tomahawk, Noctis, Asymmetry Fest, Maryland Deathfest, Scion Fest and others. The band took special care constructing the environment of each and every show with wood, incense, and imagery taken directly from their home in the Northwest. Such care made an Agalloch show more than just a typical heavy metal concert.

&gt; Yelle is a trio formed in Saint-Brieuc, France in 2005, of lead singer Julie Budet (aka Yelle) and Jean-François Perrier (aka GrandMarnier), with Tanguy Destable (aka Tepr) joining prior to their début album.

&gt; Budet rose to fame on MySpace when she posted a song titled ""Short Dick Cuizi"", dissing Cuizinier, a member of the Parisian hip-hop group TTC.

&gt; With producer and close friend GrandMarnier, Budet has recorded a début album Pop-Up, after her hit single ""Je veux te voir"" (a finalised version of ""Short Dick Cuizi""). The song, which samples the bassline from 20 Fingers' 1994 club hit Short Dick Man, received heavy airplay on MTV. She was also featured on Fatal Bazooka's song ""Parle à ma main"" in 2007. In February 2008 she performed the track ""À cause des Garçons"" on the BBC Three series ""Lily Allen and Friends"". The series claimed that this was her first appearance on UK television. She was MTV's 'Artist of the Week' for the week of 24th March-30th March 2008, appearing during adverts.

&gt; Yelle's second single ""A cause des garçons/ACDG"" is a cover song from an homonym 80's French band. A remixed version of the track by Riot in Belgium was featured on the soundtrack of Electronic Arts' computer game; Need for Speed: ProStreet. The song was also used as the opening song for the Moschino Spring Summer 2008 runway show

&gt; As of 2008, it is also featured in an advert being broadcast in Quebec for Telus, a Canadian telecommucations company and the 24th March episode of 'The Hills'. Her single ""Je veux te voir"" was featured on the series 4 final episode of Entourage, in the opening scene when the gang arrives in Cannes, and her single ""Ce jeu"" was played on Gap's and H &amp; M's shop soundtrack in summer 2008.

&gt; The DJ Tepr has been touring with her and already remixed three Yelle's songs ""A cause des garçons/ACDG"" , ""Je veux te Voir/Short Dick Cuizi"" and ""Ce Jeu"".

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/50d8a27310b0465fb9a135005f51caca.png)  

&gt; Freddie King (September 3, 1934 – December 28, 1976), thought to have been born as Frederick Christian in Gilmer, Texas, originally recording as Freddy King, and nicknamed ""the Texas Cannonball"", was an influential African-American blues guitarist and singer. He is often mentioned as one of ""the Three Kings"" of electric blues guitar, along with Albert King and B.B. King (though he was the youngest of the three).

&gt; King's mother, Ella May King, and her brother, who both played the guitar, began teaching him to play at the age of six. He liked and imitated the music of Lightnin' Sam Hopkins and saxophonist Louis Jordan. He moved with his family from Texas to the southside of Chicago in 1950. There, at age 16 he used to sneak in to local clubs, where he heard blues music performed by the likes of Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, T-Bone Walker, Elmore James, and Sonny Boy Williamson. Howlin Wolf took him under his wing (or paw), and Freddie also began jamming with Muddy Waters' sidemen, who included Eddie Taylor, Jimmy Rogers, Robert Lockwood Jr. and Little Walter.

&gt; By 1952 he had started gigged at night and working days in a steel mill (by then he had married a Texas girl, Jessie Burnett). He got occasional work as a sideman on recording sessions. Two bands that he played with during this period were the Sonny Cooper Band, and Early Payton's Blues Cats. He formed the first band of his own, the Every Hour Blues Boys, with guitarist Jimmy Lee Robinson and drummer Sonny Scott.

&gt; In 1953 he made some recordings for Parrot. In 1956 he recorded ""Country Boy"", a duet with Margaret Whitfield, and ""That's What You Think"", an uptempo blues. This was for a local label, El-Bee. Robert Lockwood Jr. appeared as a sideman on guitar.

&gt; In 1959 he met Sonny Thompson, a pianist who worked for the King/Fedreal label. In 1960, he himself signed with that label; while there he often shared songwriting credits, and participated in marathon recording sessions, with Thompson. On August 26, 1960, he recorded ""Have You Ever Loved a Woman"" and ""Hide Away"", which were to become two of his most popular tunes. His debut release for the label was ""You've Got To Love Her with Feeling"". His second release on King/Federal was ""I Love the Woman"". ""Hide Away"" was used as the B side for this disk; that tune, a 12-bar mid-tempo shuffle in E with an infectious theme in the head section, and a memorable stop-time break that featured some robust-sounding work on the bass strings, was destined to become one of his signiature numbers. It was an adaptation of a tune by Hound Dog Taylor. It was named ""Hide Away"" after a popular bar in Chicago. Strictly an instrumental -- guitar with rhythm section -- it delighted everyone by crossing over and reaching #29 on the pop chart. It was later covered by Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, the Canadian guitarist Jeff Healy, and likely a majority of the bar blues bands on Planet Earth. After the success of ""Hide Away"", the label, which was presided over by one Syd Nathan, got Freddie and Sonny Thompson to work on making more instrumentals. This they did, producing over 30 of them during the next five years. The following is a partial list: ""The Stumble,"" ""Low Tide,"" ""Wash Out,"" ""Sidetracked"", ""San-Ho-Zay,"" ""Heads Up,"" ""Onion Rings,"" and ""The Sad Nite Owl"". Freddie became popular with a young white audience, in Britain as well as the United States, and his playing was a major influence on the upcoming breed of rock guitarists. During this period he was touring frequently along with the big R&amp;B acts of the day such as Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson, James Brown. His band included his brother Benny Turner on bass; and Tyrone Davis, who would later become known in his own right, was the driver and valet.

&gt; On the personal side, Freddie was fond, perhaps overly fond, of the Chicago night life. His official website refers to him ""Gambling til dawn in the backroom of Mike's cleaners."" His wife, now with six children, decided to move back to Texas. Once there, she called Syd Nathan and demanded that he send her some of the royalty money due to her husband. To his credit, he sent her two thousand dollars, with which she made the down payment on a house. Realising that the family were definitely not coming back to Chicago, Freddie, in the spring of 1963, himself moved back to Texas to rejoin them.

&gt; His contract with King/Federal expired in 1966. That same year, while making a series of appearances on an R&amp;B program called ""The!!!Beat"", he was noticed by Atlantic Records front man King Curtis, and in 1968 he signed with the Atlantic subsidiary, Cotillion Records. He released two records for them (see Recordings), both of which showcased his vocal talents. They were not overwhelming commercial successes; however, his first overseas tour, in 1968, was a resounding triumph, being extended from one month to three. He was ""amazed by his popularity in England.""1

&gt; In 1969 he hired a young member of the ""counter culture"", Jack Calmes, to be his manager. Calmes got him booked at the 1969 Texas Pop Festival, alongside Led Zeppelin and others; and got him signed to Leon Russell's new label, Shelter Records. Shelter records was based in Oklahoma, and featured blues/rock performers such as Linda Ronstadt and Joe Cocker. The company treated Freddie as an important artist, flying him to Chicago to the former Chess studios for th recording of his first album, and giving him a supporting cast of top-calibre session musicians -- including Russell, a rock pianist.

&gt; As were many of the top bluesmen of his generation, he was now playing what he affectionately called the ""Fillmore circuit"", playing alongside the big rock acts of the day for a young, mainly white, audience. As a result of his touring with Eric Clapton, the two became good friends -- Clapton held him in very high esteem -- and following his term at Shelter Records, Freddie signed with the label Clapton was recording for, RSO. His first album there, Burglar, was produced by Clapton, and had him playing on several tracks.

&gt; He continued to tour heavily. He died in Dallas in 1976 from a heart attack and complications arising from bleeding ulcers and pancreatitis. He was just 42 years of age. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Paul Frederic Simon (born October 13, 1941 in Newark, New Jersey) is an American singer, songwriter and guitarist. He first gained world-wide recognition as the writing talent behind the popular American folk-rock duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel formed with fellow musician Art Garfunkel. When Simon &amp; Garfunkel split in 1970, Simon quickly began his solo career with the release of the self-titled album, Paul Simon. This was followed by There Goes Rhymin' Simon and Still Crazy After All These Years, both of which featured chart-topping hits such as Loves Me Like A Rock and Kodachrome. In 1986 Simon released the immensely popular Graceland, which featured the groundbreaking use of African rhythms and performers Ladysmith Black Mambazo. In 1990, he followed up Graceland with the successor album The Rhythm of the Saints which featured Brazilian and Cajun musical themes. These albums helped to popularize world music as a genre.

&gt; He co-wrote the unsuccessful, but critically-acclaimed musical The Capeman with Nobel-winning poet Derek Walcott in 1997. 

&gt; Paul Simon still tours occasionally, both as a solo artist and with his old musical partner Art Garfunkel. He is married to Edie Brickell. 

&gt; In 1994 Paul Simon held 14 sold out concerts in Nantes (France) with International professional fusion players: Nino Manore (Italy), Francis Mc Gowan (UK), Gissele Masarde (France), Nikša Sviličić (Croatia), and others. Read more on Last.fm.

It's not that uncomfortable for most but when I was listening to it when I drove by a fatal car wreck.

55937,"Not that he was nearly as essential as Cliff in the songwriting, but to be fair to Jason, I believe I have read that from the beginning he was never allowed nearly as much creative latitude or input as Cliff, and was never really made to feel entirely part of the band because they always kindve looked at him like a stand-in for Cliff. 

I'd be interested to see what might have been created if his ideas were more included into the mix. He did write the Blackened riff, so he was off to a pretty fucking epic start. Later, I don't know if it was only the bass lines or if it was more, but also My Friend of Misery, and devil's dance, and a few others. 

By comparison, (and I say this with ton of respect and admiration to Kirk and him being my idol as a kid and the reason I picked up a guitar) Kirk as far as I know has pretty much only contributed the ""die"" riff on creeping death and hit a mega home run with enter sandman. Obviously, he wrote solos to pretty much every song, more than a few of which are legendary too. 

The interesting thing about all that to me is not that it's a lack of creativity or skill by them, but the awe of the amount and quality of riffs that come out of James.

Edit: started to ramble and forgot one of my main points... For me, Jason had the best stage presence, i still get giddy watching the energy and vibe he brought to the stage. also his vocals were really great and are SORELY missed in live performances since he left.

56212,"According to the article, Hip Hop/R&amp;B are responsible for 25% of music consumption (&amp; ~30% of all on demand streams in US), with Rock at 23%. Two combined genres beating one. Not too surprising (especially because pop and r&amp;b can kind of blend together sometimes). Along with the fact that Hip Hop &amp; R&amp;B are consumed primarily by younger generations who are more active on the internet and more likely to use an on demand streaming service &amp; listen to more music. 

I think when people are younger they are more music oriented/obsessed, so whatever is popular with kids/teenagers/young adults is the primary genre(s) for hits. That's why the new ""hit"" music is almost always Pop or R&amp;B (Hip Hop too but it's not as radio friendly so more R&amp;B).

All I'm trying to say is that I think as we get older, we tend to keep enjoying what we liked when we were younger. And when we're younger, we're listening to the currently popular new music. Rock was ""the thing"" before R&amp;B, Pop, and Hip Hop. That's why it's next biggest in consumption. Now all new hit music is R&amp;B, Pop, and Hip Hop (looking at Spotify's ""New Music Friday"" about 80% falls into these 3 genres). All this article shows is that R&amp;B and Hip Hop are the currently popular new music that younger people are listening to.

&gt; The Grateful Dead consisted of: Jerry Garcia (vocals, guitar; 1965-1995), Bob Weir (guitar, vocals; 1965-1995), Phil Lesh (bass, vocals; 1965-1995),  Bill Kreutzmann (drums, 1965-1995), Mickey Hart (drums; 1965-1970, 1974-1995), Ron ""Pigpen"" McKernan (keyboards, organ, harmonica, vocals; 1965-1972), Tom Constanten (piano; 1968-1970), Keith Godchaux (keyboards; 1971-1979), Donna Jean Godchaux (vocals; 1971-1979), Brent Mydland (keyboards, vocals; 1979-1990), Bruce Hornsby (keyboards; 1990-1992) and Vince Welnick (keyboards; 1990-1995). All of these members, with the exception of Hornsby (who was their induction presenter), were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. Lyricist Robert Hunter - who wrote many of the band's songs - is often considered to be an unofficial member of the band and was also inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame with the rest of the band.

&gt; Some fans followed them from concert to concert for years. These ""Deadheads"" were renowned for their dedication to the band's music. Many followers referred to the band simply as The Dead.  

&gt; The Grateful Dead, known then as the Warlocks, became the de facto resident band of Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters, with the early sound heavily influenced by Kesey's LSD-soaked Acid Tests. Their musical influences varied widely with input from the psychedelic music of the era, combined with blues, jazz, rock and roll, and bluegrass. These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead ""the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world.""  

&gt; One of the most notable things about the Grateful Dead is their duration.  They were together for thirty years, stopping only upon the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995.  Their output, comprised mainly of a vast number of recorded concerts, is unmatched by any other band.
  
The music of the Grateful Dead lives on through many tribute bands as well as projects of the rest of the band.  These remaining members did perform together for a while as The Other Ones and later on as The Dead.  As The Other Ones, Phil Lesh, Bob Weir, Bill Kreutzman, Warren Haynes (Govt Mule), and Jeff Chimenti (Ratdog), began touring in the spring of 2009. The Dead's music continues today as Phil Lesh and Friends and Ratdog (Bob Weir solo).  Phil Lesh and Bob Weir formed The band Furthur  in 2009 and also went touring.

&gt; To celebrate the 50th anniversary of Grateful Dead, four original members — Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann, Phil Lesh, and Bob Weir — reunited for final performances together at Chicago's Soldier Field.  “Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of Grateful Dead"" took place over three nights on July 3, 4, and 5, 2015.  The band was joined by Trey Anastasio (guitar), Jeff Chimenti (keyboards), and Bruce Hornsby (piano).   Read more on Last.fm.

56820,"There are tons of holes in the framing of your analysis of what is actually happening in this instance - not the least of which is that you don't seem to understand how a cartridge works, or at what distance from the record surface. It's a coil and a ferrous element, and in the case of a high end specimen, insanely sensitive to all sorts of distortions.

It literally generates a signal from magnetic relationships between the two, where in this case, the coil moves as a result of the stylus and cantilever traveling the surface of the record.

Local neighboring distortions have a measurable impact - and often an audible one. Simply pick up a turntable and move it near your amps power supply.

Now imagine, if you will, that 'noise floor' isn't a single frequency, but many - and at many different amplitudes. Now overlay them and realize that they are conjunctive.

A room being filled with other forms of magnetic radiation does not necessarily reduce, or render opaque, another source that is infinitely closer (think 1/16th of an inch, depending on VTA and suspension).

What is shown in this sample group of one, is that there is an impact in an audible range.

Also, it's germane to this discussion that the presence of distortion from wiring, lights, the amplifier and so on doesn't have the same influence at varying distances, and isn't acting to cancel or obfuscate the input of other variable or similar distortions.

If anything, the article linked was provided as a counter-example to the 'closed case' that this is all just a load of BS. The case isn't closed, and I haven't seen evidence supplied by you or anyone else that supports that the distortion being addressed here is beneath the signal level, or at odds with common household distortions. Yet here we are... 

On the other hand, I have a test that is flawed and published in an industry magazine that may not be impartial, in response to swath of skeptics, where they failed to succeed in disproving the products stated effect after setting their own test guidelines.

Neither thing proves or disproves anything we are going to discuss today, here, on the internet - to a conclusive end.

All we have here are two opinions, one article that uses a sample group of one to prove an audible effect and... well...

Nothing else, really.

My point is, I have no problem with QRP taking steps to improve the quality of their pressings - including taking into account small amounts of magnetism that might influence the ideal operation of the instrument of playback. I've bought a lot of their releases and they're the best out there by miles in terms of consistency and quality.

&gt; Gilbert O'Sullivan was born Raymond Edward O'Sullivan on 1st December 1946 in Waterford in Ireland.  His father worked in a meat factory while his mother ran a sweet shop.  In 1958 at the age of 11 he moved with his family to Swindon in England in search of a better life.  He attended St. Joseph's Comprehensive school in Swindon.  While there he developed an interest in both music and amateur boxing.  Musically he began with the guitar and progressed to the piano.  In the boxing ring he had nearly 50 bouts.  Meanwhile his painting and drawing had won him a place at Swindon Art College.  He started there in September 1963.  His aim was to be a graphic designer.  He played drums in his first group The Doodles and left them to join The Prefects while attending Swindon Art College.  It was while at college that he met Rick Davies, who was later a member of Supertramp.  While at college he began writing songs and sending out demo tapes, alas they were always returned unopened.  The first song he remembers writing was Ready Miss Steady.

&gt; After finishing college, Gilbert moved to London in 1967 to try and further his musical career.  He took a part-time job as a salesman at the C &amp; A department store in Oxford Street.  Mike Ward who also worked at C &amp; A, had a contract with CBS and Gilbert went with him one day and played his tapes for some of the CBS executives.  Gilbert signed a five year publishing contract with CBS which called for one single a year, and released two singles Disappear/You in 1967 and What Can I Do/You in 1968.  Gilbert was disappointed that he was not allowed any input into the arranging or production of the singles.  Neither single did well.  Disillusioned with CBS, Gilbert signed with the Major Minor label and released I Wish I Could Cry/Mr. Moody's Garden in 1969.

&gt; Gilbert came to the attention of BBC Radio 1 disc jockey, John Peel, who gave him a slot on his radio show Top Gear, little of note resulted, and O'Sullivan spent part of 1969 applying to other record labels and management companies.  It was at this time that Gilbert formulated his 'Bisto Kid' image; grey flannel suit, flat cap, school boy tie, football socks and hobnail boots.  In search of a manager he sent some demo tapes to Gordon Mills, an ex-pop singer and himself a songwriter of repute, who had successfully guided the careers of Tom Jones and Engelbert Humperdinck.  Gordon Mills recognised something unique in the young Irishman and signed him for management as well as to a songwriting contract.

&gt; Gilbert made an irresistible impression with Nothing Rhymed, his first Top 10 hit and an introduction to his witty lyrics and original approach as a singer/songwriter.  Signed to MAM Records, the label launched by Gordon Mills, who was also his record producer, great friend and surrogate older brother, O'Sullivan enjoyed four years of major success, incorporating a dozen more hit singles, ten of which reached the UK Top 10, and four Top 5 albums: Himself (1971), Back To Front (1972), I'm A Writer Not A Fighter (1973) and A Stranger In My Own Back Yard (1974).  

&gt; Both Clair (written about Mills's infant daughter for whom Gilbert occasionally babysat) and Get Down were number one hit singles in Britain, and additionally, Back To Front topped the UK LP chart in 1972, emulating the success of the two million seller Alone Again (Naturally), a six week US chart-topper in 1972.  Gilbert made his live debut in The National Stadium in Dublin in October of '72.  Around this time, the singer jettisoned his so-called ""Bisto Kid"" image in favour of an endless series of collegiate-styled sweaters embossed with the letter ""G"".  As quickly as O'Sullivan ascended to fame, however, his star began to fall , although singles like Ooh Baby and Happiness Is Me and You continued to chart, they sold increasingly fewer copies, and after 1973 his overseas popularity essentially ceased altogether. At home, he notched his final Top 20 hit with 1975's I Don't Love You But I Think I Like You.  After a Greatest Hits album in 1976, and Southpaw in 1977, by which time the hit singles had dried up, disagreements over future direction led to a bitter split between O'Sullivan and Mills, which effectively sidelined the former as a recording artist for five years.  The gruelling court case between O'Sullivan and his erstwhile manager, producer, music publisher and record company boss finally gave him control of his own recordings and the copyright in his songs, although it exacted an inevitable toll on his energy and his creativity during it's precedent-setting course.

&gt; Gilbert returned to CBS in 1980 and released Off Centre (1980) and Life &amp; Rhymes (1982) but maintained a low profile during much of the 1980s, recharging his batteries and moving to Jersey, where he still lives with his wife and two children.  Off Centre provided his 13th UK Top 20 single, What's In A Kiss?, after which legal proceedings monopolised his time.  However, he continued writing songs, performing what he called ""concepts within four walls"" rather than starting back on the road before it was appropriate.  He later recalled that the lyrics he wrote during that period were too heavily influenced by his personal emotions - having been extremely close to Mills before their disagreement, he was highly distressed to discover that his dear friend had been guilty of considerable financial greed at Gilbert's expense.  Even so, he applied himself to his lonely creativity, working from 9 to 5 each day ""just like Goffin &amp; King and people like Neil Sedaka &amp; Howard Greenfield at the Brill Building in New York used to do"", although he later confessed ""Really, the words were no good, because my mind was cluttered with all the problems"".  Lyrics have always been O'Sullivan's most unique facet, reflecting what's going on in his mind, and the strain under which he found himself was hardly conducive to much positive artistic or commercial creativity.

&gt; The first release for five years was Frobisher Drive and was only available in Germany.  The same album with a slightly different track listing was released in the UK in 1989 under the title In The Key Of G, and included So What, his first chart single in almost a decade.  Since the low-key comeback, the pace has increased, with five more albums.  Gilbert also made a return to live performances in the early nineties, playing regularly in both Europe and Japan.  In 1991, Gilbert was again in court, this time he sued American rapper Biz Markie and won the decision after Markie's unauthorized sample of ""Alone Again (Naturally)"" on his 1991 album I Need a Haircut.  A 1992 single, Tomorrow Today had topped the Japanese charts for nine weeks, and this success led to a tour of Japan in early 1993 with his newly formed backing group, during which he recorded and filmed his first ever live album Tomorrow Today.  Gilbert's newfound success in Japan led to the Japanese only release of The Little Album (1992) and Rare Tracks (1992).  1993's critical acclaimed Sounds Of The Loop (Daily Telegraph's Record Of The Week) included a duet with the legendary Peggy Lee on Can't Think Straight and even a solo version of the same song in Japanese.  This album was recorded almost entirely at his home in Jersey in the Channel Islands.

&gt; By Larry (with a similar track listing to the Japanese released The Little Album) was released in 1994.  Larry is a famous English cartoonist, much admired by Gilbert.  Larry provided original cartoons for the album sleeve and booklet.  Every Song Has It's Play was released the following year and was the soundtrack of the semi-autobiographical stage show that Gilbert had acted and sang in, in 1991.  Singer Sowing Machine was released in 1997.  The title is a humorous reaction by Gilbert to being constantly referred to as a singer/ songwriter.  Irlish was released in 2000 and yielded three singles, Have It, Say Goodbye and Two's Company (Three Is Allowed).  The album title Irlish,  combination of the words Irish and English, appropriate for someone born in Ireland and raised in England.   Gilbert's family was part of this migration.  In 2001 The Official Gilbert O'Sullivan Website was launched as well as his own record label ByGum Records.

&gt; Gilbert continued to tour and he played a series of concerts in Ireland in 2001 and in the UK in 2002 to promote the Irlish album.  A new studio album Piano Foreplay followed in 2003.  In 2004 Rhino Handmade Records released a 3 CD anthology in the USA of Gilbert's music entitled Caricature: The Box.  It contains 73 tracks which span the years 1967-2001.  This is the first in-depth survey of Gilbert's lengthy career. It contains numerous singles and B-sides, tracks from 16 of his albums, and five previously unreleased tracks.  A b-side collection entitled The Other Sides of Gilbert O'Sullivan was released in Japan in 2004 and contained many tracks available on CD for the first time.  A series of concerts followed in Japan in June 2004 followed by a 20 date European Tour of the UK, Ireland, Norway and Denmark in November and December.  In February 2005 a DVD/CD set of the 2004 Japanese show was released in Japan.  Gilbert returned to Japan in June 2005 for a series of 13 shows.  Gilbert spent the end of 2005 and the beginning of 2006 recording his next studio album ""A Scruff At Heart"" which was released in Japan on 25 October 2006. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; The Replacements are an alternative rock group that formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1979. The band originally started off as a hardcore punk outfit but began to incorporate folk and power pop influences in their sound. They become one of the leaders of the early alt-folk set and one of the flagship bands of the American 80s post-punk scene, being as well a major influence on 90s indie rock.  

&gt; The band's best known lineup consisted of Paul Westerberg (vocals, guitar), Bob Stinson  (guitar), Tommy Stinson (bass) and  Chris Mars (drums). They were infamous for their abrasive, hard drinking lifestyles and their ragged stage performances, notorious for coming to some shows too drunk to play very well at all. Sometimes, they just performed entire sets of covers, their picks showing their debt to 70s hard rock outfits.

&gt; The sound of this band showed off what their many fans saw as the very best of independent rock n' roll. More than possibly any other band since The Rolling Stones and the the Ramones, the Replacements embodied the spirit of rock, from their raucous performances, drug addictions, charismatic and romantic frontman, and wild, sometimes basic and sometimes powerfully confessional songs. At any given time, almost any list of 'The Best Rock Albums Of All Time' will include either the album 'Let It Be' or 'Tim', sometimes both.

&gt; Their sound started off as a classic rock influenced shade of punk, mutating to a melodic hardcore sound reminiscent of local buddies Hüsker Dü. They also progressed into a relatively straightforward but heartfelt rock style, with a number of highly soulful ballads from the heart of Westerberg to round out the mix. 

&gt; The band broke up in 1991. Bob Stinson, who was fired from the band in 1986 (and was subsequently replaced by Slim Dunlap), died in 1995. Westerberg and Mars both have solo careers, and Tommy Stinson formed several bands, like Perfect and Bash and Pop, and now plays bass for Guns and Roses and Soul Asylum. 

&gt; In 2012, Paul Westerberg and Tommy Stinson reformed the Replacements and recorded an EP, ""Songs for Slim"" as a benefit for former member Slim Dunlap, who had suffered a stroke. The band played their first show since 1991 on August 24, 2013 at RiotFest in Toronto, and has since played at several festivals since. The band also currently includes Josh Freese on drums and Dave Minehan on guitar. The band played its final show in June 2015. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Incubus is a five-man alternative rock band formed in 1991, based in Calabasas, California. Members include Brandon Boyd (vocals and percussion), Mike Einziger (guitar), Ben Kenney (bass), Jose Pasillas II (drums) and DJ Chris Kilmore (turntables). Former members of the band include Gavin Koppel (a.k.a. DJ Lyfe) (turntables) and Alex Katunich (a.k.a. Dirk Lance) (bass). The band's name may seem a peculiar choice to fans, as an incubus is a type of demon that, in mythological lore, comes in the night and has sex with women while they are sleeping; it seduces them in their dreams The story behind the name is that the band needed to think of a name hours before their first show and, after a few failed choices, Mike looked in a dictionary and chose ""Incubus"" almost at random. Mike says that the name was chosen because it sounded silly; Brandon holds that it was chosen because they were teenagers and the definition had the word ""sex"" in it. ""We really didn't want to rape women in their sleep. But, we were fifteen and it seemed harmless to us then, and we never changed it,"" says the band.

&gt; Incubus has received both critical acclaim and commercial success, reaching multi-platinum sales, as well as releasing several successful singles. The band earned mainstream recognition with the release of their 1999 album Make Yourself. In 2001, Incubus became even more successful with the single ""Drive"" and their follow-up album Morning View. Their sixth studio album, Light Grenades, debuted at No. 1 in 2006 and has received Gold certification in the U.S. Incubus released their first greatest hits album Monuments and Melodies in June 2009, accompanied by a tour of the United States, Japan and Canada. The band's most recent album, If Not Now, When?, was released on July 12, 2011.

59226,"The tour isn't similar, you're not wrong. But ihavenoenemies' tours were probably MORE work. Bieber doesn't have to worry about setup or managing his equipment or producing his own shows. He just shows up, performs, and then parties if he feels like it and goes back to a fancy hotel.

Small bands end up playing just as many shows while also managing their own equipment and instruments (Bieber doesn't even play anything most of the time so he just has to take care of his voice, and in big shows like his lip-syncing is often employed anyway). They also usually have to organize their own accommodations and transportation which are nowhere near as luxurious.

Bieber has it pretty damn good. Playing 150 shows like he did is par for the course when you're and performer. The only thing that is more challenging for him is the weight of fame - in every other regard as a performer he's on easy street.

I also wouldn't fault him or any other performer for taking time off. The only really crappy thing is that he cancelled rhe rest of his tour which lets down lots of fans and also costs some of them quite a bit of money since many people book travel and accommodations to go see shows, which can be nonrefundable.

&gt; Groove Armada is an electronic music group from Cambridge, United Kingdom, composed of two members, Andy Cato (real name Andrew Cocup) and Tom Findlay. They first came to fame with a 1997 limited single release, At the River (made famous after being used in various Marks &amp; Spencer advertisements), which sampled ""Old Cape Cod"" by Patti Page. The song has since made its way onto numerous chill-out compilations.

&gt; Their most famous work is the 2000 international hit I See You Baby, remixed by Fatboy Slim in the Big Beat style -- with the repeated chorus line ""Shakin' that ass,"" as heard in Renault Mégane advertisements. Vocals were provided by Ibiza-based DJ Gram'Ma Funk. Incidentally, this track was also recorded with the chorus line ""Shakin' that thang"" as a radio edit. While this is their most famous work, they have also produced less mainstream songs which are often featured in television adverts.

&gt; In the early part-of 2008 after parting company with Sony BMG, Groove Armada signed an ""all encompassing deal"" with the Bacardi rum brand that allows them to use GA's tracks for adverts.  For more information, read Bands turn to brands in new deals

&gt;     * Groove Armada's Suntoucher was sampled by Jay-Z for the song ""What More Can I Say"" on his Black Album.

&gt;     * The track Hands of Time is featured in the movie Collateral, and is referred to by one of the characters as a ""classic song."" It is also featured in the television series Cold Case; it was played as the ending song in the episode entitled Street Money, from the show's sixth season.

&gt;     * Groove Armada's debut album was Northern Star, released in 1998.

&gt;     * In 1999, Groove Armada released Vertigo, which had a more polished, mainstream sound. This album includes ""At The River,"" which was re-released as a single (#23 UK).

&gt;     * In 2001, Goodbye Country, Hello Nightclub was released, with the title suggesting their new album was more upbeat and less geared toward chilling out -- as demonstrated by the single ""Superstylin'"" (#5 UK).

&gt;     * In 2002, they released the DJ mix album Another Late Night: Groove Armada, part of the Another Late Night series on Azuli Records.

&gt;     * In 2002, less than a year after Goodbye Country, Hello Nightclub, Groove Armada produced Lovebox, which incorporated a variety of genres. Some tracks, such as ""Madder,"" featured a rock element, while others, such as ""Lovebox"" and ""Remember,"" were closer to traditional house. ""Remember"" has vocals made up entirely of samples of Sandy Denny singing at Fairport.

&gt;     * In 2004, Groove Armada released a best-of album, which included hits and new productions (#6 UK).

&gt;     * In May 2007 Soundboy Rock was released, featuring the track Get Down. Guest appearances include M.A.D., Red Rat and Mutya Buena (see: Sugababes). The album was released on CD, Vinyl, and also as a limited CD package with 2 bonus tracks.

&gt;  * In March 2010 Black Light, their 6th studio album, was released.

You're mostly looking for good garage rock.  There's always Iggy Pop and the Stooges, Guided by Voices, Pavement, Sebadoh, or if you're interested in noise, the Jesus and Mary Chain.

I hate to say it, but I personally think the reason that bands fail to live up to their first albums is because they don't actually have control over their talent. Jack White isn't just talented, he's an artist. He actually understands what is good about the music he makes. His music is self-aware, something you can't really say about the examples you provided.

In the end however, its really about songwriting. If the songwriting is good, then the sound doesn't matter as much. Songwriting is tricky business. A huge portion of it is serendipity.",Music

The closest thing to what you're talking about is the Music Genome Project, wherein volunteers tag songs with characteristics (bright synths, dancey beats, 12/8 time, to name a few). Pandora is the practical manifestation of the Music Genome Project, where you give it a song/artist that you like, and characteristics that are specific to what you gave it are matched to the characteristics of other bands. They do list these characteristics, however, so if you want to discover what makes a good song for you, just look at 'em and list which ones you keep seeing.

If, in the end, you feel like devoting months to a project of that scale, you can probably build some waveform analyzer to see what waveforms are likely to have the characteristics that you like, but it would probably be for you only. ",Music

&gt; Harvey Danger was an alternative rock band that formed in Seattle, Washington in 1992 and rose to prominence in 1998 with the iconic single ""Flagpole Sitta"". Released from their debut album, 'Where Have All The Merrymakers Gone?', the song helped the group build its college radio fan-base. The band released their last album in 2005, 'Little by Little' (also known as 'Little by Little...'), after the five year hiatus that followed the release of their sophomore album, 'King James Version'. Harvey Danger has a devoted cult following (with many free downloads available from their website) but the band is widely labeled as a ""one hit wonder"", mainly due to limited mainstream radio airplay and a lack of decent record deals. 

&gt; Still, Harvey Danger has attracted U.S. attention due to their critical praise, with the All Music Guide calling the release 'Little By Little' ""a smart and compelling pop album"". In contrast, the band is little known in Europe, the aforementioned issues compounded since the band focused on selling themselves in America (especially Seattle) and thus made it very difficult for fans to get albums in Europe. The original drummer, Evan Sult, moved to Chicago and now drums in the band Bound Stems. For a short-time, he was replaced by Michael Welke, formerly of the band No. 226. 

&gt; As a symbol of the group's close connection to its fans, they published their last album as a free download along with other materials. In 2009, they announced on their website they've called it quits. According to them, their decision was mutual, and they felt the band has run its course. The single ""Flagpole Sitta"" remains popular on various radio stations as well as having notoriety from being the theme song to the popular British comedy program 'Peep Show'.

&gt; On March 6, 2016, bass player and founding member, Aaron Huffman, died of respiratory failure. Read more on Last.fm.

63222,"Rap is a very good way to distill a lot of lyrical information into a short period of time. Rap's claim to fame has been both tackling incredibly difficult topics as well as bragging about one's accomplishments and how they've earned it. Studio Executives have seen it's success in these regards, as well as desire to reach the Black demographic, so they will sometimes push a rap verse into a song.

&gt; Yazoo (known as ""Yaz"" in the U.S.) were an English synthpop duo from Basildon, UK.

&gt; Yazoo were formed in early 1982 by former Depeche Mode songwriter Vince Clarke (synthesizers) and English singer Alison Moyet (vocals) and signed to Mute Records in the United Kingdom.

&gt; Their debut single ""Only You"" was released on 15 March 1982 and rose to number 2 on the UK charts.  They also released two studio albums: Upstairs at Eric's in 1982 and You and Me Both in 1983.

&gt; Shortly after the release of the second album, Moyet and Clarke decided to break up.  Moyet pursued a solo career while Clarke first founded (the short lived) The Assembly followed by the successful Erasure.

&gt; Vince Clarke and Alison Moyet briefly reunited in 2008 and toured Europe and the United States as Yazoo for the first time in twenty-five years.  Also in 2008, their record company issued a 4-disc box set called In Your Room; containing remastered editions of both of their original albums, a disc of b-sides and remixes (imaginitively titled B-Sides and Remixes) and a DVD containing promotional videos, interviews etc.

&gt; The Gregory Brothers’ unique musical stylings and comic rapport was largely formed when Evan Gregory, Michael Gregory, and Andrew Rose Gregory began making zany mix-tapes in their living room in Radford, Virginia as tiny babies. These (sadly lost) seminal works of musical comedy gently gestated for a few years until 2007, when the brothers joined forces with a bright-eyed lass from Texas. This musical collaboration with Evan’s wife, Sarah Gregory, was forged in the fiery crucible of an un-air-conditioned van during a summer tour that year. These sweaty bonds shall never be broken. After having experienced the elation of sharing their original country &amp; soul, folk ‘n’ roll tunes with several dozen people on that home-grown, 50 show tour, they began making their wildly viral YouTube series, “Auto-Tune the News” in 2008. Their meager hope was that several dozen more people would bump their rumps to C-Span if it thumped with a bass line and a beat.

&gt; While they continue to work on making their YouTube jams, The Gregory Brothers now tour the country speaking at colleges, playing at rock and comedy clubs, and are in the process of making a pilot for Comedy Central.

&gt; They have spoken at Google ZeitGeist, MacWorld, GEL, VidCon, Web 2.0 Expo, about how they combine music, technical savvy, and humor to reach millions. Their hit “The Bed Intruder Song” was the first YouTube video to cross over onto the Billboard Hot 100. They’re also proud to have collaborated with T-Pain, Weezer, Joel Madden, Tosh.0, Adidas, NPR, Sony Electronics, Chipotle, The Cleveland Show and The 83rd Annual Academy Awards. They are also the proud winners of three Webby Awards and two Comedy Awards.

&gt; The New Radicals were an alternative rock/power pop band that formed in Los Angeles, California in 1997, being centered around front-man Gregg Alexander, who wrote and produced all of their songs. They released only one album, 1998's 'Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too', a critically acclaimed pop rock album heavily influenced by classic  rock and soul of the 60s and 70s that contained— amongst radio-friendly pop tracks and love songs— strong criticism of corporate America and modern culture. Aside from Alexander, the only other permanent member of the band was keyboardist and former child actress Danielle Brisebois. The remainder of the line-up was a fluctuating one revolving around the two of them, with the goal being to bring in a variety of musicians from many genres. 

&gt; The band is best known for their debut single, titled ""You Get What You Give"", which became a top 5 hit in the United Kingdom and has garnered major U.S. airplay for years. The song's celebrity-dissing lyrics at its end provided a minor a spectacle, with Alexander saying that the media misunderstood the meaning. Despite the song's radical messages, anti-materialistic as well as pro-youth, it's ironically been used in many films and even a famous advertising spot.

&gt; Tired of touring and promotional interviews, with the group becoming more and more commercialized, Alexander disbanded the group in mid 1999 before the release of their second single, titled ""Someday We'll Know"". He has successfully focus on writing and producing songs for other artists, winning a Grammy award for his talents. Consequently, the stunning ""Someday We'll Know"" received little attention in most countries. The band is widely considered a ""one-hit-wonder"". Read more on Last.fm.

To get a good listen at Vince's versatility, I'd suggest listening to Norf Norf, Crabs in a Bucket, Summertime (more like an alternative song than rap), War Ready (produced by James Blake), and Limos. 

If you wanna listen to a full project from him, start with Summer '06.

Denzel Curry mainly makes dark aggressive rap, so he might be a little harder to get into if you don't listen to rap, but check out the songs If Tomorrow's Not Here, Good Night, and Zenith to see other side of his music.

&gt; Louis William Tomlinson, born 24 December 1991, is from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England and is a member of English-Irish four-piece boyband One Direction. Tomlinson first started performing as a sixth form student in his school's musical productions. He starred as Danny Zuko in an adaptation of the Grease musical. In 2010 he auditioned as a solo artist for the British TV show The X Factor. He got accepted to  boot camp, but failed to advance further. He was then one of the five eliminated solo singers that were to form a boyband, as decided by the judges, and continue the competition in the bands category. He, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Liam Payne and former member Zayn Malik formed One Direction and together finished third in the competition. Simon Cowell of The X Factor did not hesitate to sign them to his label SYCO. Tomlinson and his bandmates’ first single release “What Makes You Beautiful” made it straight to number 1 in the Irish and UK charts. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Roy Smeck (born Leroy Smeck, 6 February 1900 – 5 April 1994) was an American musician. His skill on the banjo, guitar, steel guitar, and especially the ukulele earned him the nickname ""Wizard of the Strings."" 

&gt; Born in Reading, Pennsylvania, Smeck started on the vaudeville circuit. His style was influenced by Eddie Lang, Ikey Robinson, banjoist Harry Reser, and steel guitarist Sol Hoopii. Smeck could not sing well, so he developed novelty dances and trick playing to supplement his act.

&gt; On 15 April 1923, Stringed Harmony, a short film starring Smeck made in the Lee DeForest Phonofilm sound-on-film process premiered at the Rivoli Theater in New York City.

&gt; On 6 August 1926, Warner Brothers released Don Juan starring John Barrymore, the first feature released in the Vitaphone sound-on-disc system. On the program was a short film, His Pastimes, made in Vitaphone and starring Smeck, which made him an instant celebrity.

&gt; Smeck appeared in the film Club House Party (1932) with singing star Russ Columbo. He also appeared with Columbo in That Goes Double (1933) which featured Smeck on a screen divided into four parts, playing steel guitar, tenor banjo, ukulele, and six-string guitar simultaneously.

&gt; Smeck played at Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidential inaugural ball in 1933, George VI's coronation review in 1937, and toured globally. He appeared on television on variety shows hosted by Ed Sullivan, Steve Allen, and Jack Paar.

&gt; Smeck invented and endorsed the Vita-Uke and other stringed instruments marketed by the Harmony Company of Chicago.

&gt; He made over 500 recordings for various companies, including Edison Records, Victor Talking Machine Company, Columbia Records, Decca Records, Crown Records, RCA Records and others. He also wrote instruction/method books and arrangements for the instruments he played.

&gt; Kate Bush (born Catherine Bush on 30 July 1958 in Welling, Kent, England, now part of Greater London) is an English singer and songwriter known for her expressive four-octave soprano voice, idiosyncratic and literary lyrics, and eclectic and meticulous musical and production style. She debuted in 1978 with the surprise hit ""Wuthering Heights"", which was number one in the British music charts for four weeks and the first UK number one by female artist with a self-penned song. Kate will make again  UK chart history in 2014 by becoming the first female to score eight albums on the UK Official Albums Chart simultaneously.

&gt; Whilst learning the violin and piano at St. Joseph's Convent Grammar, she caught the ear of Pink Floyd's David Gilmour who funded some demos, ultimately leading to a deal with EMI (Pink Floyd's ultimate record company through the progressive Harvest imprint) when she was sixteen. Over the next two years EMI allowed her to hone her talents to and to finish school without releasing any material--while maintaining an exclusive contract.  Bush's first releases were in 1978 with the single Wuthering Heights (which went to number 1 in the UK) followed by the album The Kick Inside.

&gt; Even from her earliest works, featuring piano as a primary instrument, Bush wove together many diverse influences, melding classical music, rock, and a wide range of folk sources, producing a unique amalgam which has continued throughout her career. Later recordings have moved farther from a rock base, however, notably with the release of The Dreaming in 1982, where she experimented heavily with the then-new technology of sampling.

&gt; Recorded in the same sessions as Bush’s reworking of old material,  Director's Cut, 50 Words For Snow  comprises seven songs “set against a background of falling snow.” The album was released through the singer’s personal imprint, Fish People, on November 21, 2011. It was Kate Bush's 10th studio album.
 
Kate Bush has tackled sensitive and taboo subjects long before it had become fashionable to do so; ""Kashka From Baghdad"" is a song about a gay male couple; ""Breathing"" explores the results of nuclear fallout. Her lyrics are often literate and reference a wide array of subject matter, some of which is relatively obscure, such as Wilhelm Reich in ""Cloudbusting"", or G.I. Gurdjieff in ""Them Heavy People"".

&gt; The lush arrangements, complex production and intelligent, thoughtful lyrics found in her work can sometimes mask the fact that Kate Bush is a peculiarly witty writer and that comedy is not only a big influence on her — she has cited Monty Python, Woody Allen, Fawlty Towers and The Young Ones as particular favourites — but also a significant component of her work. In addition to her British peers, Bush has reportedly cited American musicians Frank Zappa and Devo as musical influences.

&gt; As a vocalist, she has also provided backing vocals or duets with Peter Gabriel, Roy Harper, Big Country and others. She is often cited as an influence on later artists, most especially female singers such as Jane Siberry, Happy Rhodes and Tori Amos.

&gt; Kate Bush has collected two Ivor Novello awards: in 1979 'Outstanding British Lyric' for ""The Man With The Child In His Eyes"" and 'Outstanding Contribution To British Music As A Songwriter' in 2002.  In 1987 she scooped 'Best British Female Artist' at the Brit Awards.  In 2001, Kate won Q Magazine's 'Classic Songwriter' award, revealing an unlikely fan in John Lydon who announced, in his acceptance speech for the 'Inspirational Artist Award,' ""I'd like to say hello to Kate Bush, thank you, your music is f****ng brilliant"".

&gt; Kate's song ""Running Up That Hill"", from the 1985 album Hounds Of Love, has been covered by Placebo on a number of dates during their 2006 tour. The Futureheads, released a version of Kate's ""Hounds of Love"" as a single, which did rather well.
 
Early in 2014, Kate Bush announced her first tour for 35 years - the last being in 1979 when she performed the “Tour of Life”, a gruelling series of gigs that concluded with a concert at the Hammersmith Odeon. Tickets for the new tour went on sale on March 28, 2014 and all 22 dates sold out in less than 15 mins. In response, Kate published a message on her website - “I am completely overwhelmed and genuinely shocked by the incredibly positive response from everyone.  Thank you!”.  The tour, entitled “Before the Dawn”, started on Tuesday August 26, 2014 and ran through August and September 2014 at the Hammersmith Apollo venue in the UK. The closing date was October the 1st.

I know the band gets some jokes for being the stereotype emo band, but the biggest influence in my teens was My Chemical Romance. I picked up Three Cheers when I was in 6th grade and I never looked back. It wasn't just the music but the guys themselves, it really felt like they cared about their fans and it made me love them even more.

&gt; Latin singer/songwriter, Piero de Benedictis was born in Italy in April 1944, making his debut in the mid-'60s while performing Italian songs in Argentina. 

&gt; In 1969, after winning a local festival with a Spanish-language tune titled ""Como Somos,"" Piero recorded his first album. Due to the local political contingency, the artist went into exile in 1976, living in Panama, Italy, and Spain. A show called La Gran Vuelta de Piero (The Great Piero's Return) was set up to celebrate his comeback in 1981. That performance was recorded and released as a double album titled Calor Humano. 

&gt; In 1985, Piero started touring all over Latin America along with musician José Toherkaski. A side project to help teenagers from modest families became his major goal soon after. 

&gt; In 1995, Piero produced a charitable record to help Unicef on its fight to protect children rights, getting contributions from artists such as David Gilmour, Joaquín Sabina, Annie Lennox, and León Gieco, issuing Canciones Blindadas in 2001, comprising old songs and previously unreleased material.

Pandora does what you described. It's two different approaches that give you different depth. I find Pandora's suggestions (I used to use their radio but now I only use their non-radio portion) far more shallow than last.fm; *however*, I'm much more likely to find a song that I will definitely like with Pandora (albeit the song will sound almost exactly as the other song) than with last.fm. There are perks to both, neither being the radio function. Internet radio has failed me. Grooveshark is okay.

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music.

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day.

&gt; Established as one of Europe's best Tech-House scenes hitmakers, Thomas Bruckner aka TOMCRAFT has catapulted himself this past year through various charts in different countries. He is specialized in progressive house and progressive trance and is better known for having created the tracks “Loneliness” and “Prosac”, working alongside Eniac.

&gt; Tomcraft began working as a DJ in Munich in 1994, shifting between techno and the emerging progressive trance style. The following year, he released his first track, “This Is No House”. He first met in Eniac in 1996, and the two immediately started producing music together, beginning with “Viva”. The same year yielded the track “Prosac”, but this did not achieve success until it was re-released in 2001.

&gt; 2002 was also the year Tomcraft released “Loneliness”, a progressive vocal track that eventually reached #1 in the UK [1]. The financial success allowed him to found his own record label, Great Stuff Recordings, followed up in 2005 with Craft Music.

&gt; His song “Overdose” was featured in the 2003 movie Party Monster for its parallel theme of drug use to the Club Kids of New York City.

&gt; But he not only gained attention as a producer of various chart hits, he also established himself as an internationally requested Top DJ with unrivaled success since 1993. 

&gt; This has been seen time and again with appearances in Germany at MAYDAY, LOVE PARADE, ENERGY, NATURE ONE and with an international following in the USA (NYC, Miami, San Francisco etc), Columbia, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and throughout Europe, from Istanbul to Estonia plus several appearances in the biggest UK clubs such as THE GALLERY, GODSKITCHEN, TANGLED or PROMISE.

&gt; The year 2004 will see TOMCRAFT as one of the busiest DJs around, playing tours in the US, ASIA and AUSTRALIA.

&gt; Being Munich label `KOSMO RECORDS' No1 seller, TOMCRAFT is responsible for numerous productions and chart hits. Together with his producer Robert Bormann aka ENIAC, TOMCRAFT has created hits such as ""THE MISSION"", ""THE LORD"" ""THE CIRCLE"" TV series .Others such as ""SILENCE"", ""PROSAC"", ""OVERDOSE"" and his latest U.K. number 1 hit ""LONELINESS"". In 2001 TOMCRAFT was also nominated for an ECHO AWARD in the category of best dance-act. In 2003 TOMCRAFT won 3 Germand Dance Awards for BEST ALBUM, BEST RADIO HIT and BEST DANCE TRACK. His Remix work is, with no doubt, one of the heaviest around and the list of Remix Projects is a never-ending story. BBE (7 days and one week), FUTURESHOCK (late at night), SIMPLE MINDS (spaceface), PET SHOP BOYS (flamboayn), DAVE GAHAN (bottle living) are just some of the heavily played remixes by TOMCRAFT.

&gt; Sabaton is a symphonic power metal band from Falun, Sweden formed in 1999. The band's main lyrical themes are based on war and historical battles. Lyrical content drawn from World War I, World War II and other conflicts is prevalent and includes songs about battles and leaders on all sides of said conflicts. In April 2012, four members left the band and formed another, whilst vocalist Joakim Brodén and bassist Pär Sundström continued with new members.

&gt; Sabaton was formed in 1999. After the first songs were recorded in Peter Tägtgren's studio, The Abyss, Sabaton was contacted by a couple of record labels. The band decided to sign up for Italian label Underground Symphony, under which internationally released the promo CD Fist for Fight —actually a compilation consisting of material from two demotapes recorded between 1999 and 2000— with the intention to promote forthcoming releases.

&gt; In 2002, a new album was recorded. Metalizer was supposed to be distributed by Underground Symphony as the band's debut album, but after two years of waiting, during which the band held various performances across Sweden, the album was abandoned.

&gt; The band returned for a second album titled Primo Victoria and found themselves in negotiations with several international record labels. They eventually signed with Black Lodge, the metal division of Sound Pollution. In early 2005, they recruited Daniel Myhr to relieve Joakim Brodén, who played keyboards in addition to singing, of his keyboard duties.

&gt; Their third album Attero Dominatus continued the war theme of Primo Victoria with songs like ""Back in Control"" (which focuses on the British retaking of the Falkland Islands during the Falklands War), ""Attero Dominatus"" (about the Battle of Berlin which brought about the end of World War II in Europe) and ""Angels Calling"" (about trench warfare during World War I), and was released in Europe on 28 July 2006.

&gt; In March 2007, Sabaton released Metalizer as a double disc together with Fist for Fight, along with the previously unreleased song ""Birds of War"".

&gt; As a follow up to Metalizer, in May 2008, Sabaton released its fourth album The Art of War an album inspired by the influential book by Sun Tzu. The decision to base the album upon Sun Tzu's book came from the idea that in the 2000 years since the book was written, the human race has achieved many things but apart from weapon advancements, war and tactics have remained basically the same. The album contains the singles ""Cliffs of Gallipoli"" and ""Ghost Division"".

&gt; In September 2008 it was announced that Sabaton would be performing at the 2009 ProgPowerUSA X festival in Atlanta GA USA. In addition, Sabaton were the first band confirmed for the festival Bloodstock '09 in Derby, UK. Furthermore, they toured Europe in 2009 as an opening act on the Hammerfall Tour. After their Bloodstock performance, the band went on a tour with DragonForce, towards the end of 2009, for 18 shows in the UK.

&gt; The band had hoped to begin recording the next album in October but with concerts booked and the DragonForce support tour the following month, it was pushed back. On Wednesday December 23, 2009, the band announced the name of their forthcoming album. Coat of Arms contains a majority of songs about World War II, but also has songs about other wars, like the Winter War ""White Death"". They announced it on their official website, and posted a link to a YouTube video containing the album art and a teaser music sample. Coat of Arms was released on May 21, 2010. The first music video, for Uprising, was released on August 1, 2010 and features Peter Stormare. This was accompanied by a European tour. A second music video, for Screaming Eagles, was released on May 25.

&gt; On March 31, 2012 vocalist Joakim Brodén confirmed rumors that the band would be going separate ways. Guitarists Oskar Montelius and Rikard Sundén, drummer Daniel Mulback and keyboardist Daniel Mÿhr would be departing Sabaton for unspecified reasons. Sabaton would be joined by touring members Chris Rörland and Thobbe Englund on guitar, and Robban Bäck on drums. Until a new keyboardist is found, Sabaton used digital recordings of their keyboard while touring.

&gt; Following the announcement of a new lineup taking the stage, ""Carolus Rex,"" the first single for the album of the same name (Carolus Rex), was released on April 4, 2012. The single was immediately released in both Swedish and English lyrical formats for download off of Swedish iTunes, and was available for world wide download on April 8, 2012. Coinciding the release of the new single, Sabaton also announced their world tour headlined as ""The Swedish Empire Tour"". This will also be the first time Sabaton has performed live with the new lineup.

&gt; ""Carolus Rex"" was released on May 22, 2012 in the United States and Sweden, and May 25, 2012 in the rest of Europe. The album was made available in both Swedish and English versions.

&gt; Regarding the line-up change, Sabaton's bassist Pär Sundström commented: ""It appears to be sudden, but it had actually started years ago when some members already got tired of constant touring. And with wives and kids back home it does not get any easier. During the recordings of Carolus Rex I drew a map of what the band will be doing the coming 3 years and for some that was too much commitment...""

&gt; The former members of Sabaton have since formed a new band called ""Civil War"", including vocalist Patrik Johansson and bassist Stefan Eriksson.

&gt; In November 2012, drummer Robban Bäck decided to take a break from touring due to becoming a father. With Snowy Shaw replacing him as touring drummer.

&gt; In November 2013, it was announced that Sabaton would be touring North America with Iced Earth for six weeks in the spring of 2014. Robban Bäck has also left the band and been replaced with Hannes van Dahl of Evergrey.

&gt; In January 2014, the band announced the cover of their new album called ""Heroes,"" due to be released on May 16 2014. The album proved to be a hit and made #1 on the official Swedish album chart. On 27 January the band was announced to play Download Festival in June.

&gt; Thobbe Englund left Sabaton as guitarist with release of their new album ""The Last Stand"" on 19th August 2016 to ""expand his own creativeness in combination with a somewhat stiller life, where he will not tour all year round at the speed of light"" as he said himself.

69042,"My vote is ""Custer"" by slipknot. It's such a mean if not evil sounding song and I'm not even a huge metal fan. But something about it feels so *right*",Music
69067,"As seriously fucked up as [the Middle Passage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Passage) was, I can't imagine that planking has any connection to it, beyond some that are unfortunate and ultimately-tangential (and certainly not conscious). Specifically, the similarities of the position of the body during both acts; and in the semantics, where ""planking"" alludes to lumber, which is transported in the same way as slaves would have been. But if you think someone actually *meant* to allude to that, tenuous as it is?

...Yeah, no.",Music
69069,"I'm not sure I would necessarily disagree, but I also don't think much modern black metal takes *that* much from the Scandinavian sound either. It's more the aesthetic, and tone. Production values are infinitely higher, the musicianship is shrarper, and it's all just a lot more mature.

Something like [Carach Angren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAZd9fM0FgM) are what I would typically show as where that sound has ""reached"" nowadays. At least without refering to more... Hybrid acts, like Behemoth or something.  I was never a huge fan of the old norwegian stuff when it was around, production value grates my ears too much. 

Definately the same roots; But I would probably contest modern Black metal is as similar to second wave as second was to first. ",Music

69130,You may like [Owen Pallett/Final Fantasy](http://youtu.be/GGb8DuyskMA). (Final Fantasy was his stage name until he got big enough where he had to worry about copyright lawsuits with Square Enix). He does a lot of arrangement work for various bands (he got famous for his work with Arcade Fire). He's a bit darker than Andrew Bird but equally talented.,Music
69147,"I use spotify. I mostly listen to the ""discover weekly"" playlist which updates every week with different artists with different styles of music. Now of course it narrows down the variety of music the more I listen. Its wonderful for finding new bands that I can use to build my own personal playlists. I understand where you're coming from, the more you listen, the more the songs are bound to repeat themselves. I Love most styles of music so I'm always finding new stuff to listen to. I hope the longer these streaming services are out, the developers will learn what needs to be done and continue to update them to make listening to new bands and artists just that much easier.",Music

69315,"It's U2. I don't think they claimed to be anything other than a pop band. 12 bar blues is 3 chords and that never stopped anyone from pouring their heart out on 6 strings. That being said, writing a catchy tune is not an easy feat, even if it's based solely on a 3 chord progression. I've gotta admit, the Edge's rifts have always let me a bit down.
