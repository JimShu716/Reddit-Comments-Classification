66,"Braves are a solid B in my book. The fact we're even talking about a possible playoff run is exciting. If you told me at the start of the season we'd be hovering around .500 I would've been thrilled. Pitching has been shaky but not horrible, Freddie hasn't skipped a beat since his injury, Ender is killing it in CF, and Johan Camargo is exceeding all expectations. Trade some of our vets and bring some of our young guys up soon and the Braves are gonna be so fun to watch.",baseball

Not that it wasn't that already with those 9 runs.",baseball
217,Considering part of the debate for that title is Pedro Martinez I'm pretty sure you shouldn't tell your fellow fans that,baseball
221,Why would it be more?  So many games left and our division is very cramped together.  Any team that can rip off 10 straight could be either in the lead or be very close to it. ,baseball
238,Joey Votto had a .490 OBP in the second half of 2016 and also batted .408,baseball
250,"Because they can't just buy players. If the Red Sox offered Reinsdorf 200m for Sale, and didn't have to give up their prospects, they'd be able to win a lot more. ",baseball

307,"Utley was doing really shitty to begin the year. He had 5 hits in 41 ABs in april. People were basically saying that this is it for Chase (which it basically is), and that the Dodgers should just release him. 

It's the fact that Judge's stats were off the charts, now he's looking more and more like 2016 Judge. The Derby didn't fuck his swing, people slump, people regress, anyone who seriously thinks that Judge is a .300+ hitter is out of their minds. 

It's natural for players to regress, Judge is regressing really hard, unlike Mark Reynolds, who has gradually slumped from his torrid April-May. ",baseball
335,"Marwin stole all his hitting prowess.

When he finally does come around, your offense is going to be scarier than it already is.",baseball
350,"To be honest, I would have done the same thing in that situation. I once was nearly hit in the back of the head by a softball earlier this year (playing shortstop, from the field behind me with a good 30 feet between the fences). I probably had a very peculiar face when I turned around to see where it came from.",baseball
357,"This was a horrible call and should've definitely been interference, but I'm confused - why are the Red Sox getting so many challenges this game? They challenged the Castro tag and lost, and they challenged Ellsbury being safe at second and lost. Then they challenged this play before protesting it. Was there some rule change I'm unaware of? I thought if you challenged once and lost you couldn't challenge again. Again, horrible call, I wish it would've just been called interference, just confused about the challenge rules, especially with the league supposedly cracking down on pace of play.",baseball
392,"I know he would, but I can't decide if he is a green monster who kicks ass or a literal booger",baseball
415,"Candelario had no clear path to the majors if he remains with the Cubs.

I like this move, even though I really liked Candelario.

As Theo said, there is no need to worry about the farm.  ",baseball

So what do you use to benchmark pitchers?",baseball

For really hot games, I normally divide my time between my seat and the concourse.",baseball
484,That actually is really interesting... I guess they're so balanced they don't even need their back foot planted? ,baseball
518,Yeah we were in a pretty tricky situation. Just got to hold off and hope our pieces gain value I guess? Too much $ in underperforming players we can move. ,baseball
523,Impressive he held onto that as it snowconed over the wall.,baseball
529,"well we did give you an early sweep, so had to follow up with the happy bday post ha",baseball
614,"Let me lead with saying I think Chapman is/was better  overall. With that being said, this guy was a starting pitcher in 2015 and the start of 2016. Comparing apples to oranges by comparing those results to his current numbers. His ERA out of the bullpen was under two last year, as well. He can also pitch multiple innings as they were having him do before moving him to a traditional closer role in May.",baseball
620,"A week ago we were flappy boys, but now we're sappy boys.",baseball
675,"Farrell *hates* Rich Keefe, which makes me love Keefe. when he asked Farrell if he apologized, Farrell rambled on for a minute without answering, and he just said ""i take that as a 'no?'"" i almost lost it at work. 

&gt; there's pretty much a 0% chance of Eck ever doing a road game again.

it's worth mentioning that the only reason he was doing any road games in the first place is because Remy has cancer. Eck had no desire to be on that plane in the first place but he was being a good guy and helping to cover for a guy with cancer. and the message from Farrell is that he deserved to be ambushed.  ",baseball
700,I think that fan shaking in the stands unsettled him. ,baseball
713,I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/6nen8b/story_time_with_torii_hunter) the [video](https://streamable.com/ytiwi) of Torii sharing this story last night,baseball
735,"Well, we had them both for a month in the offseason, when the A's got Lowrie from the Astros, but a month later Lawrie got traded. 
So we did have them at the same time, but they didn't play in a game together. 
But OP's question was about ""the same lineup"", so technically you are correct. ",baseball
789,"I believe tbey primarily want pitching, so I'd sub out Wong or Bader with Weaver or Alcantara probably. Also, they have Gordon locked up for a while I believe and Wong has only played second (unless you count his stint in center...)",baseball

905,"Cease has very high upside, he was coming back from TJ but has fantastic stuff. If he gets his walks under control a bit he could be great, he's been lighting up the low A leagues for a couple years regardless. The other 2 are just filler. ",baseball

948,NBA needs to address this guys taking massive pay cuts shit. It is making the league massively imbalanced. ,baseball

970,by rule the correct call. Doubt it gets called with only 4 umpires though,baseball
976,We need to get the word out to him then,baseball
996,"2 prospects: Mauricio Dubon and Josh Pennington. And Dubon is the only interesting of the two. 

I still agree with the logic. Could not have seen Shaw being this good and relievers are very expensive right now. Just didn't work out. ",baseball
1019,Dennis Sarfate. That's a name I've not heard in a long time. A long time.,baseball
1033,Wtf? We just traded for Garcia two days ago. Is two losses on the road against the best team in the league really that big of a deal that it would make us go from buyers to sellers?,baseball

1158,Definitely let us know when the Rockies one is ready!,baseball
1164,"It took Theo 4 years to completely overhaul our farm system, which is roughly how many years we have left before all our young contracts come up. I think he can do it again.",baseball

1188,This can't be emphasized enough but the organization will never admit it.,baseball
1194,"Oh yeah /r/baseball hates this guy because he was into dog fighting, right? Oh no, he was alleged to have raped a girl right? No. He took roids? No.  He bet on baseball? No. Right, it's because people think he's an overexposed attention-whore for trying to have fun even though his high school yearbook shows him doing similar antics.  ",baseball
1216,"Look at the return JD Martinez got. Now realize that the market for Lynn is way lower, and he is also a rental like JD. Now realize that the Royals don't have a consensus Top 100 prospect.

1316,That call by Joe though. It's true though. This team won't stop.,baseball
1336,"Stroman's was one of the nastiest pitchers I've ever seen. Sale's was good, but not that incredible compared to Stroman's. Can't believe it won.",baseball
1394,This was my question too; I feel like it's easy and beneficial to compare them. Take a look at the outsides and also do a cross-section to check what's inside. Shouldn't be too difficult for a trained eye to pick apart any differences. ,baseball
1415,Not really talking about Lester or Greinke type deals. We need back of the rotation arms. Only 3 starters are needed in the playoffs. If Quintana works out then we're set for a few years with cheap back end guys,baseball
1422,"Nice, haters gonna hate. You Giants fans are known for your wit aren't you? ",baseball
1424,"Why wouldn't a MLB caliber player, and like 3-4 mid prospects land a pitcher who frankly hasn't been healthy over the past two seasons ",baseball

1457,"Haha, right.  Like I said... DC had no interest in baseball in 2009 and definitely before.  It was glorious for the more serious baseball fan... besides the shit tier team they produced year after year.  I mean it was a decent plan... advertise until D.C. caught on and then cast away their division rivals.  Can't blame them nowadays when they don't need those ticket sales.    ",baseball
1463,This isn't a flash of brilliance.  This is a guy taking a slow route to a ball and making it look harder than it should be. ,baseball
1468,When Moylan comes back that should improve the quality of the pen by sliding one of the worse guys out.,baseball
1515,I've been listening to the Mets broadcast crew for a couple weeks now and I love 'em.  I'd like to discuss a trade.  I swear I'm authorized to handle such things,baseball
1535,"Yea, I'm all for beating up water coolers to release some anger but punching something with your pitching hand is a really bad idea. I think it was Kevin Brown who punched a wall in the dugout and broke his hand. ",baseball
1541,Whoops my bad. How could I forget about Big Tim Timmy Tee,baseball
1554,"Last I checked, fans don't like opposing players, nor should visiting players like the opposing fans. I know here in NY we definitely try and give visiting players as much hell as possible",baseball

It's not exactly shocking that a guy of that frame can crush baseballs",baseball
1649,"TBH I'm looking at 110+ pitches per outing and wondering what that looks like long term. Maybe not injury per se, but nobody's immune to fatigue.

5505,"between the dbacks and rockies, i still think one of them will fade in the second half. 

nationals have their own issues. a hobbled outfield and a still questionable bullpen even with recent additions. however, they are the team that scares me most in the NL, other than the dodgers. 

i know there is some bias here but the cubs' roster is very similar to last year's, it just took the first half to shake off the effects of last year's postseason (elongated season, shortened off season, myriad of off the field sponsorship commitments, appearances, and distractions that are generally front loaded at the beginning of the season).  

they're finally starting to play up to their potential, and have added quintana who i think will only get better as he builds more confidence as a result of finally getting some run support.  starting rotation is kicking into gear, the bullpen has been very good all season and i hope that continues, and offense taking more quality at bats and scoring runs consistently.

Out of his 19 starts, he's given up 2 ER or less in 11 of them. If you take out the dreadful starts, that's only 5 below average starts, which I could live with from a 35 year old guy. 

In addition, he's posted his highest K/9 since '13. Without stats to back me up on this (just going off memory), it seems like most of his runs are given up by walking a guy or two and then letting up a homer since his BB/9 and HR/9 are all career highs.

Looking at his pitch/fx data, it looks like his success depends on the movement of his curve (surprise, surprise). His velo for his curve is also down about 5mph since his peak, but he's also losing about 1-2"" of horizontal run of his curve while his other pitches remain the same. He's also losing about 1-2"" of vert movement from his curve. In turn, this makes it less deceptive which generates more takes, which equals more walks.

Anderson has more promise than Schwarber in my opinion, in 173 games Anderson has a career WAR of 2.7, compared to Schwarber's .5 in 135. Schwarber is just a bat in the NL, he can't field, he can't run, he can just hit, and right now he's not doing the good of a job. Anderson needs work but to give up on him in the next 2 years is dumb, when he's showed a lot of promise last year.

What is harder now is to stand out, to be a star. Your assertion that today's pitching is diluted is just absolutely ludicrous; we have more pitchers now throwing harder than ever, with filthier stuff. We integrated in 1947 and now MLB is more global than it ever has been; therefore, even though there are more teams, the talent pool is exponentially bigger. And, given the argument that you make (""video rooms, charter flights, modern medicine, year round training staffs, not needing to work in the off-season""), more pitchers today can make themselves extremely good. Before the game was played more on pure ability and talent. Now, the game is much more a skill game, as most if not all the players are extensively physically trained.

The ""Juiced"" era was a direct and logical extension to the ever-evolving training of the players. We had reached a point where training more was not giving the players the gains they wanted, and for those not sufficiently skilled, brute strength gave them an edge. Eventually, star players realized *they* could get even better, and started using, which is what happened with McGwire and Bonds, among others.

The next closest this year are Keuchel and Kershaw, respectively .143 and .145 averages against with runners in scoring position. Since 2002 (that's as far back as FanGraphs' splits will take you) no qualified starting pitcher has has this dominant an AVG against with RISP.

And for teams that have a lights out bullpen and a terrible starting rotation (i.e: the Orioles and Royals the last several years, both consistently underrated by Pythag.), the teams are more likely to get blown out early in games, leading to a wildly skewed run differential, but are also more likely to win close, late games.

Now take a 300 pitch game, which is about average, and take the average time between those 300 pitches as 23.8 seconds -- as it has been so far this year -- it comes out to a minute shy of 2 hours.

This is why they might get a lot of hits in a game but only score a few runs.

Other times, they simply can't get on base, like today where they had 3 hits for the whole game. They have a few guys who are regular starters that are batting in the low .200s. 

To compound the problem, this lack of runs takes its toll on the pitching, which is the team's only saving grace. It is way easier to pitch with a lead because you can go after the hitters by throwing strikes and getting ahead in the count.

17144,"1. I highly disagree he's looked as good as you can hope. He lacked hustle on a play last night from Phillips and gave AZ a 4th out because of it. That's one thing Dansby has that no one can knock him on. Hustle. Dansby's Def. metrics are all also way better as an SS. Errors are garbage (I know you didn't mention them, just to note).

2. Much bigger sample size from Dansby this year than Camargo. Expect Camargo's to drop too the more he plays. He doesn't have any plate discipline, he's not all that fast and his BABIP is high. That's the worst recipe.

3. I agree. I've wanted Dansby in AAA for a week now. Just think it's funny they waited until he came in and went 2-4 and played better than Johan lol. They do this any time before today and it goes unquestioned.

4. You're right, I am being incredibly condescending. It's just frustration from reading every GDT and seeing the exaggeration put into Johan's play so far. Fool me once (Dansby), shame on you. Fool me twice (Camargo?). Well... y'know -- Anywho, I apologize. I will say the initial comment was in jest obviously.

NESN decided that the voice of the Red Sox for the last 15 years whom everyone loved, and made the losing seasons the Red Sox have had recently, bearable, wasn't good enough. They instead brought in the dry personalty of Dave O'Brien who is admittedly a great commentator, but is just so freaking boring. I swear he couldn't make the end of the fucking world interesting.

Why NESN got rid of Don isn't fully known, but I do know that they
asked him to lie about the decision, and say that it was a mutual agreement. (It wasn't, Don grew up a Red Sox fan, and loves them, in fact, it wouldn't surprise me if part of the reason he choose a NL team was so that he wouldn't have to commentate against his favorite team very often.) Don himself said that they asked him to do this, and that he refused.

All I know is that Don handled the whole situation with the absolute class, and until his final game was the same Don Sox fans had known for the last 15 years, never once making it seem like the announcement was made public 2/3 of a way through a losing season. NESN looked like fools in the end, and honestly, many people are still bitter about it (including myself)

*The Astros are boycotted

*The All-AL trade is completed

*Some other teams are boycotted for unboycotting the Astros

*The Mariners pull out of the all-AL trade

*All boycotts are lifted but those on the Astros

*A new megatrade, scaled back from the initial proposal, debuts. The Red Sox do not immediately join. Why? See previous item.

*The Indians choose a new GM

*The Mariners ~~are back in~~ ~~pull back out of~~ can't make up their fucking minds about the All-AL trade. Now we hate them.

*The Red Sox and Astros still don't make up.

*The Mariners might be out of the AL!

*The players demand a union and subsequently ask that no one talk about unions after the thread was spammed relentlessly.

*The Mariners are back in the AL, and the all-AL trade. We no longer hate them

*The Red Sox and Astros still haven't made up.

*The AL and NL refuse to trade during the ASG.

*As a result, an early closing of the commissioner's office (6:00 PM MDT) is announced.

*The Red Sox and Astros are still not speaking, but at least the Mariners are back.

**TL;DR: Everybody hates the Astros, some people decide the Astros are okay, others decide the second group mentioned isn't okay, everybody's okay except the Astros, the all-AL trade is announced like ten times as being completed, mega trades are negotiated and negotiated some more, there's a new guy in charge of the Astros, the players don't get a union, the Red Sox still hate the Astros**",baseball

&gt; ""I've seen the reports about GM's being chosen with clearly no prior experience and I can't say I'm surprised. When you have /r/SFGiants GM's running around like headless chickens making crazy alliances like #RetakeTheSkies you can't help but wonder what the hell is going on in the OotC.

&gt; I think we all need to take a good look at what's going on in our league. We've got illegal and unprofessional alliances running around like the retake the skies one and we've got a crooked Commissioner too. I'm very afraid at what this means for our league and you should all be too.""",baseball
25099,"I think when people say a ball rises is because hitters expect a fastball to drop a certain amount. But some pitchers probably throw with enough RPM that it can seem like the ball rises.

25255,"Fair enough. For what it's worth I'm not the one who downvoted you. 

I think xFIP is a little flawed. I think it takes longer than a season for a pitcher's home run rate to normalize to the league average, so I don't really consider it when looking at Cy Young awards. Sure, it's possible that Sale will have a little bad luck on fly balls for the rest of the season but it's a gambler's fallacy to assume that he'll give up more home runs over the rest of the season just because he's given up fewer than average so far. If you average Sale's xFIP with his FIP so far this season, it's still lower than Kluber's FIP/xFIP average. ",baseball

[This is why I don't quite see why someone would spend a ton on Gray. Wacha is a solid pitcher, but I wouldn't give up a top 10 prospect for him. Everything is super similar. The only thing that is somewhat significantly different is the ERA, but they were much closer before their last starts, and Wacha was plagued by poor defense last year (3.91 FIP for a 5.09 ERA). They have the exact same years remaining and both have an injury history.](/spoiler)

25677,"That one fairly egregious high strike is a lot less egregious when you realize he was giving a little bit extra at the top all together. Especially since he's a callup guy, this makes sense since the MLB umpires refuse to call the rulebook strikezone (not represented by Brooks) but the MiLB guys are encouraged to do so. 

As for the handful of strikes balled, without watching the video I can't say but MLB, not even MLB Umpires but MLB encourages umpires to manage the game, one of their tools for doing so is balling strikes that catcher fucking murder. Without watching the video, it's hard to say that he actually missed any strikes. Non are egregious enough that the catcher can't have merced them. 

Also, fairly egregious? It's like 2-3 inches high at most. Consider his strike zone was probably 1-2 inches above the Belt+4 inches that PitchFX used to determine the top, then it's 0-1 inches inconsistent.

Pretty. Fucking. Fantastic.

31064,"From across the pond, welcome to pretty much the best sport ever!  We're glad you're here :)  I'm gonna try to keep it general, cuz I think once you've got the basics down you can just watch some games and refine it from there.  Also, I learned a lot of stuff about the game by playing video games like The Show, so if you can get a copy of that and wanna get more in-depth that's actually not a bad way to come at it from a different angle.

Let's start with the overall structure of the game.  One of the things that's different from most sports is how many games there are in a season, and to accommodate that two teams will play several games in a row against each other.  That's only really important if you don't want to look silly when talking to another baseball fan.  As far as actual game structure, there are nine **innings** a game.  Each inning has a ""top"" and a ""bottom;"" in Major League Baseball the away team gets to hit in the top of an inning and the home team defends (""fields"").  

Arguably the main competition happening within a game is between the pitcher and the batter.  Whenever a batter steps up to take his swings, that's called an **at bat** or AB for short.  During an AB, the batter will try to swing at pitches in what's called the **strike zone**.  The strike zone (and correct me if I'm wrong on this guys cuz it has changed some) is the width of home plate and the height is between a batter's belt and his knees.  It's important to understand the strike zone because then you can understand **balls** and **strikes**.  A ball is whenever a pitcher throws outside the strike zone and the batter doesn't swing at it.  However, if a batter *does* swing and either misses the ball or fouls it off, it counts as a strike.  A **foul** is when the batter puts the bat on the ball but it goes out of bounds.  This can be into the seats, behind the batter's box, outside the foul lines (those little white lines that go straight out from home plate, cross third and first base, and extend all the way to the edge of the outfield), etc.  

The total number of balls and strikes in an AB is called the **count**.  The count's important because once a batter gets 4 balls, he takes first base on a **walk**, which is also called a ""base on balls"" in ye olde lingoe and why the stat is abbreviated BB.  But if the pitcher throws him 3 strikes, he's out!  That's called a **strikeout**.  However, a foul ball never counts as a third strike, it's only a strike out if the batter doesn't make contact (either swinging and missing or not swinging at a pitch in the strike zone).  

There are other ways to record an **out** too; strikeouts are by far the least common.  First let's talk **fly outs**.  That's when a batter gets the ball in the air but it's caught by one of the fielders.  There are two ""special"" fly outs, one being a **pop fly**.  That's just a fly ball that doesn't leave the infield (i.e. usually it's caught by the pitcher or a baseman rather than an outfielder).  There are also **foul outs**.  Like  I said before, fouls are balls that aren't in the normal playing field.  But pretty much all stadiums have what's called ""foul territory,"" which is space between the foul lines and the seats.  If a fielder catches a fly ball that stays out of the seats, that's a foul out!  Second, though, there are **ground outs**.  A ball is considered ""live"" as soon as it touches fair ground.  All that really means is that the batter-cum-runner isn't out yet.  Anyway, if the batter hits the ball on the ground, one of the fielders can pick it up and throw it to first base.  If the ball gets to the base before the runner does, he's out!

Obviously if every batter got out all the time the game wouldn't really have a point, so there are also **hits**!  There are really only four flavors of hits: Singles, doubles, triples, and home runs.  As the names imply, it's just what base the runner can manage to get to safely.  If there's a runner on second or third base, we say he's in **scoring position**, which means that any hit has a pretty good chance of getting him home.  Incidentally, that's how points or **runs** are scored: having a runner cross home plate. 

A batter is credited with a **run batted in** (RBI for short) when he gets a hit and a runner makes it home.  There are other ways to get an RBI, too:  If there's a runner in scoring position (usually third base but sometimes second if the guy is REALLY fast) and the batter hits a fly ball far enough into the outfield, the runner can still score if he **tags up** and runs home.  Since the ball hasn't hit the ground, it's not live yet.  Once it hits the fielder's glove, though, we're off to the races!  The runner first has to tag the bag he's on, then when the ball comes alive he can score.  If he does, then the batter is out but he still gets an RBI.  However, the fielders have a chance to throw the ball home and try to tag the runner out before he touches the base.  

There are other **sacrifice plays** besides the sac fly.  Batters can also hit sacrifice ground balls, but these aren't always to score runs like the sac fly is.  Explaining this part requires a lot of strategy talk so I'll steer clear of a lot of it since I'm just trying to go through the basics, but a lot of the time it's just to move a runner into scoring position.

I'll finish out by just talking about a couple of the stats you'll hear a lot about.  Ima start with hitting stats!  The most common one you'll hear is **batting average** or just ""average.""  This stat is just what percent of the time a batter will get a hit.  Also, even though a lot of these stats are shown as decimals, they're really percentages.  So like if a batter has a .250 average, chances are he'll get a hit every fourth AB.  If he's got a .333 average, it'll be a third of the time.  So on and so forth.  If a player is batting over .300 that's generally considered really good.  Jose Reyes right now has a .350 average and that's the highest in all of MLB, so that's really good.  As an historical note, batting .400 is kind of a mythical achievement that not too many guys have managed.

I've already explained RBIs, but just FYI that's the other big stat that most media outlets highlight as the most important one.  Home runs are usually the third stat that rounds out what they show you on TV when a guy steps up to bat.  It's becoming more common, though, that a player's **on base percentage** or OBP is displayed.  That's the average number of times a guy gets on base either by hits, walks, or being hit by a pitch (if a pitcher hits a batter with the ball the batter automatically gets to take first base no matter what the count is).  Some people consider OBP to be the most important stat, but that's something you can [read more about](http://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1311262914&amp;sr=8-1) if you want.  

And now here are some pitching stats!  Probably the two biggest stats commentators highlight are **earned run average** or ERA and **wins**.  The ERA is the average number of runs that pitcher would allow in nine innings.  Say, for example, his ERA is 3.00.  That means, were he to throw all nine innings of a game, he'd give up 3 runs on average.  Anything lower than that is usually considered pretty elite.  Wins are becoming more widely regarded as kind of a meaningless stat but, nonetheless, can be a big impressive number we like to ooo and ahhh at.  The stat itself is just if one pitcher gave up fewer runs than the other.  That's kind of a gross oversimplification, but I'm not sure I can really articulate the nuances much better than that.  The pitching equivalent of OBP is the **WHIP**, or walks plus hits per inning pitched.  I say ""equivalent"" because both are stats that are really important but only just starting to be talked about during an average broadcast.  WHIP is a really crucial stat because it reflects how many baserunners the pitcher allows during an inning.  A WHIP of less than 1.00 is suuuuper good, but becoming more common in the post-steroid era.

33040,"&gt; On the first point, the point I'm making is that one of the reasons Colon has been so durable and consistent is precisely because he doesn't throw 95. So yes, those guys are better on a per inning basis, but who cares if they can't stay healthy enough to pitch as many innings as Colon?


And my point was, what if those injuries were freak accidents, not because they were injury prone?

Look at Colon's career before 2012: plenty of seasons where he didn't even manage 100 innings and plenty of injuries.

Look at other pithers that throw 95 and don't have injury histories, or ones that throw about as hard as Bartolo and do have plenty of injuries — including Keuchel, who's not really a flamethrower.

Sometimes injuries are just flukes.

&gt; On the second point, this just highlights what WAR is measuring. Who cares who's the better pitcher or throws harder or whatever. Just concentrate on actual contribution. 

Sure, and on a per inning or per game basis, Bartolo contributes less.

&gt; By that measure, if you know the future, you would obviously select the guy you know for a fact will contribute more. 

Pointless hypothetical. If you know the future, you pick the guy you know is better and do everything in your power to prevent injury so they can continue to contribute.

&gt; Saying Colon isn't as good as these other guys misses the point. The original point was he is underrated, and the support for that assertion was that he ranks 23rd since 2012 in one popular measure of contribution (this by the way includes his crap performance this season).

And you seem to have missed my point that by rWAR — a measure that tells you how they actually performed rather than how good they were at limiting walks and home runs while getting strikeouts and infield fly balls like fWAR, those players were all more valuable than Bartolo in that time except for Gerrit Cole, which is probably because he didn't even pitch in the majors in 2012.

How does fact that he's 23rd in fWAR in that time frame prove that he's underrated? It doesn't make him the 23rd best pitcher in baseball in that time or that he even contributed the 23rd most wins among pitchers. It means he has the 23rd best combination of strikeouts, walks, infield flies, and home runs for the formula.",baseball

33480,"When I was 7 years old, I lived in NJ.  My granddad was a big baseball fan, and had this love/hate relationship with the Yankees.  Like he was born in Greenwich Village in the 1920's, and lived upstate a bit and loved the Yankees since childhood.  But then Steinbrenner bought them and he just *HATED* steinbrenner, but still simultaneously loved the Yanks.  

I watched his fandom and the ups and downs he had in the 80's, snd it was confusing to me as a small child.  Then in a magical year, the METS beat the Red Sox in the world series, and in strange, improbable fashion.  The ONLY baseball thing my granddad hated more than George Steinbrenner was the freakin' Boston Red Sox.  So he was understandably gleeful at this turn of events, so I sort of 7-year-old bandwagon hopped on the Mets train.  

I figured all my friends (who were universally Yankees fans) were in for years of disappointment and failure - I was sure to be on the right side of history!  As a side note, I now have 3 kids and live in Virginia and they are all Nationals fans.  I could not force Mets fandom upon them, as that would be grounds for child protective services to be called.

Now I am a 38 year old Mets fan, and I am pretty sure that there is a God, and there is a Devil, and they made a Job-like pact to screw around with the Mets fanbase as a test of our faithfulness.  It's worse than being consistently bad.  It's like, here is a taste of potential greatness, then it gets yoinked right away.

33942,"You're right in your intuition that field conditions and equipment are important considerations when comparing their defense. Fielding percentages were much worse in Vaughan's day as fields were poorly maintained, gloves were smaller, and balls would often become warped after continued use. For that reason it's difficult to compare historical fielding percentages.

Evaluating Jeter by fielding percentage will paint a favorable picture. He's very reliable and sure handed and as a result appears to be an excellent defender. In actuality his range (particularly to his left) is very poor. [This](http://www.billjamesonline.net/fieldingbible/jeter.asp) is an excellent article by Bill James regarding Jeter's defense. He concludes,

&gt;I have to say that the case for Jeter as a Gold Glove quality shortstop is a dead argument in my mind. There is a lot we don’t know, and Derek Jeter could be a better shortstop than we have measured him as being for any of a dozen reasons. He is not a Gold Glove quality shortstop. He isn’t an average defensive shortstop. Giving him every possible break on the unknowns, he is still going to emerge as a below average defensive shortstop.

Using numbers provided...

1) Gordon home to 3B + 3B to home: 11.1 + ~4.5= 15.6

2) Crawford ready to throw + Time it takes ball to travel to home and tag: ~11.75 + 2 = 13.75.

3) Subtract these times and we get: 15.6 - 13.75 = 1.85 sec.

I feel like if he's running hard out of the box and to third base (you can see him slowing down as he approaches on the video clip) he could have found that 1.85 seconds somewhere.

If you just looked at the guy in front of him, David Wells, you would have seen that it took him 660 games to accumulate as much fWAR as Kershaw did in more than half the time.

Then you could have synthesized that data internally and realized that if he made it to 54 in only 285 games then yeah, he's probably one of the best all time.

48463,"kimbrel is ahead of hoffman in most non counting stats. era, era+, whip, fip, h/9, hr/9, k/9, and k/bb. he also leads hoffman in most of these by a mile. hoffman had 2 full seasons where he posted an era+ of over 200, whereas kimbrel has only finished below 200 in 3 out of his 8 seasons. 

kimbrel pitches in an average 68 games per 162 game season, has put up 16.8 total WAR and averages about 2.5 WAR in each season. hoffman also averaged 68 games per season and put up 28 WAR, or about 1.8 WAR per season. thats an average of .7 WAR more per season, or almost an additional 40 percent of hoffman's yearly WAR. thats huge for pitchers who generally only throw one inning and who accumulate so few innings per year.

kimbrel obviously has an astronomically far way to go to be considered the best closer of all time, but at the rate he's gong, he will be in the conversation in a few years if he doesn't have a drop off in production. my one concern with kimbrel is his longevity. pitchers like mariano and hoffman were able to keep their careers going long after their pitch velocity started to drop, and kimbrel definitely relies heavily on his overpowering speed. he also does not have the control that mo or hoffman had, and has a bb/9 of 3.4, where mariano's was 2.0 and hoffman's was 2.5 (this is one of the only rate stats where hoffman is better than kimbrel).

if you still really care about saves, you still better prepare yourself for a future that will probably still be full of arguments of kimbrel vs *insert historically good reliever here* because of the insane save rate kimbrel has had since he started pitching. in hoffman's first 7 seasons as a closer, he accumulated 266 saves in 491.1 innings. (he also saved 10 games over 180 innings in his first 3 seasons as a non closing reliever). in mariano's first 7 seasons he saved 278 games over 475 innings. (he also saved 5 games over 175 innings in his first 2 seasons as a non closing reliever). in kimbrel's first 7 seasons he's so far saved 280 games in 423 innings and only has one other save in the year before his rookie season where he pitched 20 innings. 

this means that kimbrel has a very very small lead in saves over mariano and hoffman at the same point in each of their careers. he will probably add a bit to that lead before the end of the season, but he's still far from what i would call having a ""comfortable"" lead. he's also pitched a ton less innings than the other two closers did in that time, basically an entire season of innings less than either of them. this bodes well for kimbrel as its a lot less stress put on his arm early in his career. the biggest advantage that kimbrel has though, is age. through their 7 full seasons as a closer, hoffman was 32, mariano was 33, *and kimbrel still isn't turning 30 until next year*. he's 3 full seasons (at his rate 120 saves) ahead of hoffman and 4 full seasons (160 saves) ahead of mariano. if he keeps up his career average of 40 saves per season, he'll reach 600 in 8 years (when he's still 37) and pass mariano by the time he turns 39. this is definitely not a sure thing, as injuries and down years happen all the time, but if kimbrel can find a way to maintain his healthiness, improve control, be on a decent teams, and not lose too much velocity, then i can definitely see him being crowned the new saves leader before he retires. remember that hoffman pitched until he was 42 and mariano until he was 43. its remarkable that each of them were able to remain so productive until so late in their careers, but the head start that kimbrel got on each of them still puts the 600 save club exclusivity in danger of acquiring a new member.",baseball

49213,"As a first baseman Howard's WAR was never going to highlight his value as a hitter. He was still a consistent 120+ wrC+ hitter with plenty of power left before his injury. Sabermetrics may have proved still that Howard was overrated given that he was seen as a much bigger impact bat than he was, but that doesn't mean he didn't have meaningful value anyway. 

Also remember that other first baseman were being resigned at that time too. Prince Fielder, Joey Votto, and Albert Pujols all eventually extended/resigned/signed significantly larger deals than Howard that same offseason (Howard resigned during the season iirc, before his injury). While Howard may have had the Subway-commercial star power of those actual premier first baseman, the difference in their contracts definitely exemplified their difference in expected production from 2012 onward, even if Howard made more up front. 

You bring up a good point that Howard still had 2 years of team control, but for RAJ to fully commit to the team as it was, first base needed to be filled for that window. Howard's contract was likely going to have an ugly end if he didn't have his achilles injury anyway, however, Ruin Tomorrow Jr. had already committed to an aging Roy Halladay and Ibanez, and in one 365 day period resigned Howard, Rollins, Utley, Hamels, and nabbed Papelbon in FA (all while the team completely fell apart in 2012 and RAJ decided to go all-in anyway). In committing to that likely historically awful plan, Howard's extension compared to his contemporaries wasn't as bad as hindsight currently makes it.

55980,"It is a combination of the  glass and the ceramic together.

""Safety Glass"" is designed to fracture into small, non jagged polygons.  It does this by having a high surface tension layer relative to the rest of the glass.  A similar (or at least analogous), ""macro"" version of this is what happens with [dried lake beds](http://i.imgur.com/4l3xgUG.jpg) but instead of at an atomic scale, and instantly, like glass... it is at a relatively massive scale, and very slowly.  Safety Glass also has a property called ""Hardness"" (as defined by a material's resistance to scratching) which is sometimes measured using ""Mohs Hardness Scale""... a score from 1 - 10 (higher is more hard, pure diamond is the hardest with a score of 10).  Safety Glass in side windows is ~7.

These ""Ninja Rocks"" as they are sometimes called are made from Aluminum Oxide which has a Mohs score of 9... so almost diamond level hardness.  That means when it fractures, the edges and points are extremely durable to impact.  Just like a knife is better at cutting meat than a flat bar made of the same steel, those points can, with a minimal amount of energy, penetrate the less hard glass surface, thereby releasing the tension inherent in the glass and ""popping"" it like a balloon.

So while density (mass to volume) is a way of putting more energy into impact (depleted uranium rounds for example), that isn't the most important factor here.  [Here is a dramatic demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=44&amp;v=h_QeBqyWuDE) of where ""more energy"" is trumped by ""sharp and hard"".

56026,"The thing is... Bonds pre-steroids blew Griffey out of the water. For the whole of the 1990s Bonds averaged a 1.036 OPS. His triple slash was .302/.434/.602.

Griffey posted a higher OPS than Bonds' 10 year average only once in his entire career and that was the strike shortened 1994. Griffey hit .323/.402/.674

Next closest was 1993 where Griffey hit .309/.408/.617

That 1994 season was also the only year of their careers where Griffey ended up with a season long higher OPS. Bonds hit .312/.426/.647 Griffey again hit .323/.402/.674 meaning Griffey had an OPS 3 points higher, but with a much lower OBP. The net result is that Bonds wRC+ was still a full 10 points higher than Griffey's 163 that year.

I've lived in six metropolitain areas thusfar in my life. I've gone to countless games in all these markets and also seen a handful of games in miscellaneous areas around the country. San Francisco Giants fans have been my least favorite. I'll counter this by mentioning I made several life-long friends who have been Giants fans, and are for the most part good fans. For the most part, their fans are huge douchebags. Every time I've gone to a Giants game has been a poor experience. When the games were at Candlestick, it was nothing but thugs and assholes. I've never heard so much profanity and vulgarity as the Candlestick bleachers. When they moved to AT&amp;T (Pacbell), the stadium was loaded with uppity Marin County douchebags that showed up in the 2nd and left in the 7th. It's still prevalent to this day, although there's the legion of bandwagon fans that showed up last year. When the Giants lost the World Series in 2002, I saw many, many people I know look down on those talking about the games like they were somehow above it all and acted like we were stupid just for being interested in the World Series. When they won, the same people were claiming they've been hardcore fans forever. It's not just the general asshattery, every fanbase is guilty of that. More than any other fanbase I've dealt with, however, Giants fans are incredibly stuck-up and talk more shit about other teams and fans while claiming they are God's gift to baseball. When Brian Stow got beat up, the Giants fans all came out of the woodwork saying ""This would never happen in San Francisco! Dodger fans are just a bunch of gang banging thugs!"", proving that they never went to a game at the 'Stick and probably haven't been around the city all that much. They berate Dodger fans for leaving early, and yet 2/3 of the Giant ""fans"" in the stadium wouldn't recognize Brian Wilson because they're all out wine tasting by the 8th inning. They yell profane, disgusting things at players and coaches, then hire Gloria Allred when someone says something back. They talk about Oakland A's fans not being loyal and just being Raider fans in green, when really, they're just as shitty in every respect, if not worse. I can't stand Yankee fans, but when I think of Giants fans, I just laugh. Then puke.",baseball

Unfortunately, I'd have to disagree with you. Some of the most significant money in baseball is coming from the cable television contracts. While the population in Oregon is greatly surpassed by North Carolina, there is only one professional sports team in the state, and only two professional sports teams on the west coast outside of California. 

In terms of the value of a regional sports network cable TV contract, it's worth lot of money. The fan base in NC and VA would be regarded as torn between other baseball teams and other professional sports teams, while the team in Portland will have a lot of the fans from the west coast, stretching pretty far east into the midwest, and as far west as China/Japan/Korea. 

So, fiscally speaking, the value of putting a team in Raleigh isn't quite as high as you might think it is.

Next year is another transition year since I don't see the Mets making any major moves in the offseason due to their financial situation.

What financial situation?  They have 55 million dollars coming off the books, their own regional sports network, a brand new stadium where everything costs more money than God, where they're drawing over 30,000 a game for the year and close to 40,000 over the past 6 weeks, and Citibank pays them $20 million just to slap their name on the front door every year.  Anyone who writes a lazy article about how the Mets have no money are gonna have to explain all that to me.

68086,"I honestly don't know who the best players in the world were at the time and no one can say so definitively. Other than the Negro Leagues, there were lots of leagues out there (tons of independent teams and leagues) in the early days of baseball and presumably some of those guys made it to the AL or NL, and many did not. But it's kind of nonsense to assume there were other players who would have been playing in the American League and would have been so good that Gehrig would have been dragged down substantially. Who knows? Maybe Gehrig would have performed well against them too. I think if the talent pool were expanded, you would probably see the average player's skill rise but I think the top guys would still really, really stand out.
  
I don't want to diminish Albert's accomplishment at all, he's an all-time great and had a shot to be the best player of all time. He'll just have to settle for being one of the best.  
  
And I am not sure I agree that the gap is smaller or bigger. I thought WAR accounted for things like era and ballpark differences?  
  
There are just so many differences between these eras that we'll never know. I think there are definitely some guys who, if they played today, would still be very, very, very good (if not elite) ballplayers. The same things that make people good baseball players (baseball IQ, reaction time, strength, speed, etc.) --- people had those qualities in the 1930's too.   
  
Though to be fair, we have seen many scrub MLB players go to like, the KBO or the NPB and absolutely dominate. Can we compare the MLB of the 1930s to AAA? To NPB? To the Mexican leagues? How do we come up with a good comparison?
