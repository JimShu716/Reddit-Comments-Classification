1230,"&gt;. If the PCs are running a bunch of shit in the background and it's causing them to struggle to run CSGO to the pro's standards then all of them will be running the same background stuff.

But that doesn't mean the background things are running properly / configured properly for everybody. Each player has their own SSD's meaning a certain players SSD might have not have been configured probably. Also just because everything is there doesn't mean it's running properly, look at Shroud with his NVIDIA. It crashed and it caused his PC to lag but it didn't happen of every other computer.

No it's probably not seeming as they're using high end i7s.

1772,"SK is ranked higher than Fnatic. Do you think its entertaining if SK wins that matchup every time they play? With how SK killed Fnatic in the BO1, would that really be more entertaining as a QF, than seeing an underdog in Optic play SK?

If you only want the 'best matchups' at events, why even invite 16 teams and have a group stage? Might as well just invite 4-8 teams and go straight to BO3 playoffs then. 

Remember when Optic won Eleague Season 2? C9 won ESL season 4? NIP won IEM Oakland? Dignitas won Epicenter? Na'Vi won ESL New York? VP won Dreamhack Vegas? All of those finals were exciting, and not because the ""best 2"" teams were in the finals, because good CS was played. 

Just like in my OP 
&gt; I think part of this problem people have is that CS is so competitive now. The #15 team actually has a chance against the #1 team.

There is a very high level of parity in professional CS right now. Anybody can beat anybody, and that's what leads to interesting matchups and entertaining CS. I'm okay with underdogs having deep runs into playoffs, with #1 teams getting upset. Part of the excitement going into tomorrow is wondering if Liquid has what it takes to continue a deeper run.

If you get placed in &gt;gold 4 than you should watching videos about economy, nades, holding angles, the a little bit more advanced things as it seems you got the basics.

From there you can start practicing your AIM, but not the hardcore way, just a little bit of DM here and there but mainly stick to Matchmaking as for lower ranks this is IMO the best way to improve.

* If your aim is good enough to win a majority of 1v1 duels then you need to focus on playing a more selective map pool and learning a few smokes/pop-flashes for these maps. 

* Recognize common spots where you die from consistently (ex. Awper playing fence on Cache) and learn how to smoke off these spots.

* Most common advise is that you should be able to frag your way out of Nova, but truthfully not everybody can frag-out or be a DM gym rat. Sometimes it is best to learn proper utility usage even in lower ranks - be a team player and help your teammates get their frags as well.

ESL has a rule in place that would cover this exploit:

 4.1.7 Clipping is not permitted. A player will be considered to be clipping if they boost their character through a solid object or manipulate their character in order to see over, under, and/or through a solid object. 

The conversation is: BIG exploited to get to the tournament, they're a t2-t3 team that uses exploits to get ahead. You've seen them use it vs Faze and C9 this tournament and now have seen proof of them using it vs SK. They've so far used this exploit in every single game they've played in this major. These are base moral values, I don't understand why you defend them? They're clearly doing wrong... Like what do you not get about being able to see over a wall and not be seen isn't game breaking? Are you aware how the peeker advantage works? Are you aware of how much of an actual advantage it is to be able to KNOW where enemies are?

Similar happened with this major but it was much too short. I only had like 3 days of habit worthy watching. Then it started to be a bit messy and then the finals came and buh bye major. 

1 major per year, massive pool, lasts for at least 2 weeks. It's a win-win. 

There's enough space between each major for you to really develop a thirst for it. 

It's only one major so if the hosts fuck up THEY DON'T GET another CHANCE. Imagine if PGL was the only major of the year and 50% of the time we should be spending watching we were bored to death because of endless problems. They would never get the major again.

29224,"I actually happen to be a programmer. While I do not work for Valve, I have many years experience. The problem is not with the game's code so much. I will do my best to provide some insight.

WALLS: The game has to send the data to your computer when someone is on the other side of a wall. Otherwise, wallbangs, footstep sounds, etc. wouldn't be possible. A ""wall"" obviously isnt a real wall, but rather an image of a wall. Your eyes care, but the computer does not. Think of Photoshop and layers. If a layer below the layer you are on is covered, you cannot see it, but the computer knows it's there. The only way to stop this, or even prevent it, would be to encrypt and/or obfuscate the memory address pointers in the game. This is possible to do, whether valve did automated tiny updates every 10 mins, at the start of every match, etc. However, this goes beyond the scope of many programmers and is not nearly as easy to do as it is to say. 

WALLS tl;dr: Could be prevented, wouldn't need reprogrammed, would need smarter programmers.

Aim / Trigger Bot: This is next to impossible to stop from a programmers standpoint. Again, changing the memory address pointers would be the only way so the bot wouldn't be able to know what to aim at. And even then, pixel differences, etc could still be made. The problem with these is there not so much a ""hack"" into the game, but automation of user input. 

So what CAN be done, and how do 3rd party sites do it? Well of course none of us know for sure, but I would imagine first off they do signature scanning. They simply go to the major cheat providers, buy the cheat, know its signature, and detect it. Not very high level, but does the job. Second, and perhaps more ""invasive"" is it looks at memory and api calls. A far cry from looking at your browser history for example. For example: WriteProcessMemory is a common windows API used to modify the memory and thus the game. Anticheats can ""hook"" this api, so that when it's called, if it's target is the game, it's blocked / detected. A challenge here for programmers is that some things such as Antivirus could produce false positives.

What would be best, in my opinion, is do what the Governments do when they catch hackers. Hire them. Hire the people who are making these cheats, who know the exploits well, and use them as defense. Also, instant ban and/or shadow ban them. No more of this play for hundreds if not thousands of hours, eventually get a ban someday.

33229,"They failed in the event that mattered most, the majors. The other tournaments don't matter nearly as much, especially when they ultimately couldn't win and kept coming in 2nd. 2nd place is sometimes worse than last, as seen from the breakdown of Zeus na'vi where there was a lot of tension and frustration and blame on the team which couldn't win and always came in 2nd during the zeus era, which lead to them backstabbing and kicking him behind his back. I think a few members like guardian/seized even publicly said that Zeus lost his team and the team was in disarray and they stopped listening to his calls and lost trust in him and Zeus has said it himself that he lost his team and they no longer accepted him as their leader and stopped listening and trusting him anymore (and if you look back in their interviews, they were all very unhappy and even seemed resentful with the results and blamed Zeus for not being able to pull his weight). Guardian also said once that he felt coming in 2nd all the time and not being able to win felt hopeless and that it felt good to finally win and to prove to himself they can actually win (after their win at ESL ONE NY with s1mple).

There's also been studies done (google it if you don't believe me) that show that silver Olympic winners are the least happiest out of all the medalists (gold, silver, and bronze) and are most likely to be disappointed and angry at themselves and bronze medalists were overall happy and much more happier than silvers (because most were happy to just to get a medal) while silver medalists felt that they failed or fell short. And obviously gold medalists were the happiest overall. The even worse part was let alone getting 2nd, they bombed out at the most important event of the year 0-3 in the group stages and failed to get legend status. And faze's twitter (meaninglessly) tweeted that this result was unacceptable right after, which seems odd since most teams don't usually release statements regarding their failures or address it publicly, so I felt the faze management must have been distraught or severely disappointed in this team and their results at the major, and no longer believed in them to ultimately be able to win, which lead to this change.",GlobalOffensive

Loading shaders from disk will 99.999% of the time be faster than compiling them from scratch (compiling is a slow process, no matter how fast your CPU is).

Regardless, this will have zero, zilch, nada impact to your FPS since it all happens during load. This never happens during gameplay. It literally has no impact on FPS ever under any conditions in any game. That's just fundamentally not how this works. This setting does exactly what it says it does - it ""optimizes 3D application load times"".

First thing - In my opinion anyone guilty of either of those crimes should also get a permanent ban from all sport competitions. Not my decision but those are also easy calls for me. If you beat on women or torture animals for kicks, get your piece of shit ass out of my league and don't ever come back.

Second thing - Those crimes are committed against other people (or animals). They are outlawed for a reason, but they don't harm the sport that the guilty parties are involved in, beyond the bad optics of it all. So they are not comparable offenses.

Match fixing harms the competition *itself*, not a single individual. All of the other players, the organizers, and most of all the fans are harmed when someone intentionally loses a match in exchange for money.

40591,"Aiming is overrated because even if you are good at putting your crosshair on the right part of the body, it doesn´t matter if you don´t hit your shot. And this is the part you can just grind out ad practice in workshops. The problem is that people MOVE to much in the moment of hitting the trigger. You need to learn counter strafing with fast stop. 

For example I found a Deagle workshop map with pretty open spaces and sat for a couple of hours just focusing on moving for example right and then just hitting left really fast to stop before pulling the trigger. I started to hit some insane Deagle headshots even on long rage, I was just laughing with love haha. That really made it click for me even if I have played CS for a long time. Be patience and don´t stress the shots. If the body model is still you will hit where the crosshair is placed. If you move while shooting it´s more luck and you get frustrated and tilted that you don´t get a frag. It´s really hard to get used to counter strafing, but when you master it including holding angels and peeking you will become a BEAST. Better hitting the shots then slamming the mousebutton and pray. And yes, you can still be very active in moving, but you just have to master the ""move and stop"" technics and practice offline alot at first. 
Trust me, you will be amazed how easy it can be to for example hit 3-4 one Deags. Another challenging practice mode you can try is finding a smaller workshop map for Awp where you can also use Deagle and try to kill the Awpers witch only Deag. Very good practice and you really have to use all your skills in moving/peeking and having patience. The reason I use Deagle as an example so much is that you get great feedback fast.

42596,"Valve implemented the new spray pattern on the Negev as a 'suppressing fire' type weapon, something which counter strike hasn't had before. People aren't using it because that style of weapon doesn't match the current play style of the game. 

It doesn't fit the pistol 'adadad' or the SMG 'run n gun' or the lurker, etc etc etc. 
Usually the new play styles are derived from the pro scene downwards ('top down') but in this case with the Negev banned at the top, we aren't seeing a new play style develop in the lower levels. 

For example, a suitable use of suppressing fire would be on CT side cache mid, laying out unlimited bullets from white box in to a smoked mid warehouse so the T's can't push while 3 T's push b and one self boosts mid. Another strategy for suppressing fire could be on T side, where the Negev clears angles by crouch walking, forcing the CT's out of some positions and making them play safer angles, then the rest of the team using utilities on those angles to force them in to the open. 

I'm not saying either of the above would be great, or even slightly good at all - but I would love to see the Negev opened up at the top level (allowed for pro's) to see what 'new meta' they can come up with. If they can't find a valid use for suppressing fire, then valve need to go back to the drawing board... And if they can, let's enjoy! Reward to the forward thinkers!

And besides all the aim practice, demo watching, ect.. that you can get (and a lot of people here gave awesome advise in that chapter) for me there's two keys to go against a smurf:
First, mindset. You know they are better than you so start the game playing safe, not taking too much risks. This helps to build some confidence (and you really have to have a lot to go against them). Maybe they are just a guy having a awesome day. If you start to get frustated you will make a lot of mistakes and give them free frags. In the end of the day, we are all human.
Second, if you can't outaim them, just outsmart them. It's easier to say than to do, but if you start thinking the game you can mess with their heads. I started to play as a lurker with my friends because of that. It's almost impossible to lurk in MM as you need a team to do it properly, but if you find some off-angles, start review your demos to see when to push, or not to push, teasing them with some false info ect, you can get one or two kills that start to make them frustrated. And in the end, all that a smurf have is pride.
Point of the story: keep positive, it's a david vs goliah thing. You can do it, just work hard and play smart. ",GlobalOffensive

Build your team on a basis, many teams have a basis that they work on. Faze would be using their star players, while SK would be an execute or a double awp setup. Create something that you know you can fall back on.

Practices should be your team spectating you and you showing them. Once you have shown them, do a dry run and use the strat in a game to practice it.

The tournament is held in Korea, but some of the top teams from the West were invited . This season we had only two of them, the fully-French Rogue and EnVyUs' international mix, but neither reached the finals. Regardless the match-up will be quite insteresting and in this article I break it down by comparing the two finalists, Lunatic-Hai and KongDoo Panthera, to well-know CS:GO line-ups and players.

At DH Summer they went out in groups, with IMT, SK and Singularity in their group. (This was the tournament IMT beat SK in the groups.)

58202,"&gt; i dont understand why people are mad at big for using this, it's in the game so why not abuse it

Because in a lot of CSGO tournaments, the abuse of a bug is strictly prohibited by the rulebook. While no one has a ruling against this exact bug, in the case of ESL it would have been up to the admins to decide whether it was game breaking or affected the outcome of the game.  

As it says here, in section 6.5, use of bugs and glitches: https://gfx.esl.eu/media/eu/csgo/eslone/katowice2015/ESLOne_CSGO_Rulebook.pdf  

&gt;The intentional use of any bugs, glitches, or errors in the game are penalized with six (6) minor penalty points per incident, up to a maximum of eighteen (18) minor penalty points per match. Furthermore, it is up to the admins discretion whether or not the use of said bugs had an effect on the match, and whether or not he will award rounds, or the match to the opposing team, or to force a rematch. In extreme cases, the penalty for abusing bugs may be even higher.  
&gt;The usage of the following bugs is strictly forbidden, if any bug is used which is not listed here it is up to the admins discretion whether or not a punishment is necessary.  
 

&gt;Generally, the use of any bugs in the game is strictly forbidden. (For example: spawn bugs).
An exception are the following bugs which are explicitly allowed:  
- Defusing the bomb through walls and items etc.  
- So called “surfing” on tubes  
- So called “fireboost”  
The tournament directions reserves the right, also retroactively, to add more bugs to the list of explicitly
allowed bugs

Even a gentlemen's agreement is so freaking vague that it is going to cause further drama. There is no way to police at what point it is an abuse. What happens, if there's even one guy who does this by accident? Do we throw the gentlemen's agreement out the window?

Being mentally prepared for a fight is the best thing to react better in cs. Sometimes you can already feel when the enemie is gonna peek so you are mentally prepared for the shot and this leads to a faster reaction time if you can even feel that the enemie is gonna peek at that moment you could even blindly kill him. Kenny is insane when it comes to reaction times because he A: has an insane reaction time and B: has really fast and precise flicks which leads to enemies dying faster than usual. ,GlobalOffensive

**What does the current value for var represent?**

*Value for sv var when server performance is meeting tickrate requirements represents the standard deviation of accuracy of server OS nanosleep function measured in microseconds over the history of last 50 server frames. The latest update relies on it for efficiently sleeping and waking up to start next frame simulation. Should usually be fractions of milliseconds. Value for client var near fps net graph display is showing standard deviation of client framerate measured in milliseconds over the history of last 1000 client frames. By using fps_max to restrict client rendering to maintain a consistent fps client can have framerate variability at a very low value, but keep in mind that system processes and 3rd party software can influence framerate variability as well.*

You may be confusing the cause with the symptom; something is causing your computer to stutter/rubberband, which causes var to rise.

Investigate software(s) interfering with the available resources.",GlobalOffensive
