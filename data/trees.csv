3072,"Doing edibles is the WORST choice when you're getting high for the first time - if we are talking about the well known methods. Since your ingesting it, the THC hits you all at once. That's probably how you felt how you did. I also wouldn't get high when sick, even if mildly - much better to get rest. 

If you do go back, try joints or a pipe. You could hit a bong, but it has the capability to really mess up newcomers. I stay away from edibles. My brother and one of my friends split one. They had pretty bad trips. Another one of my friends took an equivalent to 30 dosages to the regular serving by accident (his brother really messed up the measurements) and he got sent to another dimension for 48 hours. It sounded horrifying after he was explaining it when he was finally sober. 

Bad trips eventually happen to everyone, but the good trips make it so much more worth it. Take it slow.

In other words, there are conceivable situations in which firing someone for using medical cannabis as part of doctor-approved treatment would indeed violate disabilities statues.

Noise - the first thing that comes into mind when viewing this one. Both visual and acoustic noise. Energetic, colorfull, it even has a bloody theramin into it, with a most gorgeous blonde girl playing it. It's a video that makes you want to go out and dance all night, endless amounts of energy flowing through your veins, nothing can stop you. An experience, in the true meaning of the word. Light one up and start making a few little ones for the road. The adventure begins now!

39.  [God Is An Astronaut - Suicide By Star - Fan Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZltd_nz2ag)

An exquisit fan video made for an awesome song, that is most of all, entrancing. I think that word describes it best. The wonderful choire-like string in the background and the reverbe give the song the necesary depth to transform it into a soundtrack of life. Sticking to the movie's story line, this really is ""A Space Odyssey?"", a voyage through space, light and color, with the right sound to match it. A cold an harsh space oddysey, but that's space. Really makes you realise how amazing it is for us to be sheltered by Earth, and how lucky we are to even exist in such a harsh enviroment.

38. [Mogwai - Friend Of The Night - Official Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC_3alnTE9g)

Not the greatest Mogwai song, but definetely their greatest video. Art made out of everyday objects, connections being made between feelings and inanimate objects. Such a bold move on the behalf of the director, to try to really find common grounds between the abstract of feeling and the touchable material realm. The sentiment, enclosed in the most absolute subjectivity and uncertainty, not ever knowing if what you call happiness or sadness is universal when you express them verbally to another person, these are themes that are depicted in this amazing video. The music has no words, and the director uses fantastic images and objects to reproduce the mood of the song, chasing a chaotic trail of thought. A journey worth loosing yourself into.

37. [Titiyo - Stumble to fall - Official Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkbh0_juEGg)

You might want to watch this with your significant other, but not necesarily. An amazing song, fantastic voice and instrumental, with scenes of what's basically, people making sweet love. As the case with Parov Stelar's ""Powder"", this song can go both ways, depending on what you feel, or what you maybe want to feel. Clean, simple video and huge, passionate sound make this video go above average because of the haunting calm it resonates. Enjoy, miss or wish for - now, in the past or in the future. These are six out of the eight facets of a geometrical shape made out of time and feeling, with it's bases being the two lovers. This is what you'd expect to find yourself pondering about when watching this video. 

36. [Benga and Coki - Night - Official Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNStVlJWy88)

Got something for all you dubstep lovers out there as well, a gift for the love of bass that I began to feel once I heard my first proper dubstep track. For all the skeptics, there really IS good dubstep out there if you're patient enough to find it. This is a legendary tune, a stepping stone for what would be the great commercial coming out party for dubstep, with a video that matches it's simplicity but imagination-provoking capabilities. As a special treat, for all of you who love dubstep, you should not miss [THIS ONE](http://www.mixcloud.com/erwtenpeller/a-dubstep-version-of-war-of-the-worlds/). Erwtenpeller's War of the Worlds dubstep remix is a piece of art. Couldn't put this on the list, for it has no video. Unfortunately, dubstep and drum and bass videos are scarce and of poor quality, so many will not make the list, but if there are requests, I can make a top 10 or top 20 dubstep/dnb list. 

35. [Ghost in the Shell: Innocence - Original theme remastered - Fan Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YhFhbrgrH8)

Don't quite know if this will make the cut, in the end, but it seems to have made it this night, we'll see about it when I finish the list. Just a great anime, with a huge soundtrack, I promised a little something for every taste, so this is my personal favorite anime video. Almost like a battle shout, this song makes hair grow on your chest, man or woman, it doesn't matter. All that matters is that at the end of it, you'll feel prepared for pretty much anything. Epic war drums along with haunting antique vocals almost lamenting for war, teach you that discipline is key. Your eyes will probably develop diabetes from this one.

34. [Gabriel Rios - Broad Day Light - Official Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_Dy79bXK9I)

Man, I just love a good wake and bake! And this, is the perfect song to do it to. The vocal's just light and smooth, the video somewhat crazy, and the instrumental jumpy and energetic. The kids' voices really bring out the optimism and hope in someone. What could possibly go wrong on a sunny Saturday, waking up with a strong black coffee, some nice dank and this song playing in the background? Whoa, LET'S DO SHIT! Cheese omlette, orange juice, quick shower, and the world is yours. Maybe you need to clean the house up a bit, or maybe it's too nice to stay indoors and should go outside, in the park, everything's a journey from now on!*Lloyd who's got them Polaroids*

33. [Various - Hater - Official Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UA1DuuJ6ymc)

Another awesome equalizer-video created by ""Kandle Design"", that goes perfect with the song. The graphics are just amazing, the creator focusing mainly on shape and dynamics rather than color and depth. The complexity of this is mind blowing, and so is probably the number of hours put into this awesome 3D video. A treat for the eyes, but for the ears as well, this will surely take you on it's shoulders and show you what sometimes the Earth looks like to all of us. The phrase ""this means the world to me"" will get a whole new dimension for you from now on, because sometimes, an object, a person, or an activity will get your full attention and it will literally be your sole purpose.

32. [65daysofstatic - Radio Protector - Live](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cjbA1rGb2k)

Not really much to say about the video, except for some really cool close-ups of the guys, helping you see the dedication and concentration on their faces. The song is just huge and powerful, intense would be the word I'd use if I only had one to describe this song. Also, the lights. It's a purple haze, guys.

31.[Queens Of The Stone Age - Go With The Flow - Official Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcHKOC64KnE)

Man when I first saw this one on MTV2 in 2003 or 2004 I was blown away. Not only was the song unbelievable awesome, but the video was just great. Rendered in black, white and red, it's dynamic, fast and full of adrenaline. The high school boy that I was would never be the same after experiencing this video blazed-as-fuck on a hot summer Friday night, munching on caramels and drinking cold home-made ice coffee, enjoying the few moments of comfortable silence I had back when living with my parents. The song's wiki page says the video has been filmed in England, which is totally surprising. It gave me the impression of a long interstate desert road from the States. The symbols, sound and band starring this clip are the epitome of epic bad assery. This video is, if I dare say it, cool! Yes, I said it, gonna go out and buy myself one of those hats with a tiny fan on it now.

30. [Dirty Three - Some Summers They Drop Like Flies - Live](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbWTUtScWa4)

You really have to be patient with this one, it has a slow start, and the audio is kind of bad to begin with anyway, so when I first found this I was quite skeptical to be honest, but I really enjoyed what I stumbled upon. Dirty Three is an Australian band, creating some entrancing, gorgeous, romantic, lustful, optimistically melancholic instrumental music there to sooth your ears if you are in the right mood for it.

Work with your local community's trash pickup force that is already in place (ya know when you see people following a truck down the side of the road holding trash bags looking mad af?). Offer people to volunteer to work with them and in return have something set up where people get their work signed off. This system is almost assuredly already in place because most of the people doing it are fulfilling community service. In return, dispensary gives free weed to people who bring slips from the trash pickup team.

Be kind of funny that just a few years ago people would get caught buying weed and have to pick up trash for community service, and now people can do that same exact community service and get free weed instead.

First two rips, I definitely felt something but not the whole effect. I took another and sat in my chair with Radiohead playing on itunes with the visualizer open. I felt as if I was on a rollercoaster when you're slowly going to the top of the hump. The visualizer felt like it was almost coming at me and I was moving towards it, it was very enjoyable so I decided to take one more hit. The instant I opened the bathroom door after the hit, time froze and I felt as if I was barrel rolling at light's speed. At the same time I thought I was stuck in that moment of time for eternity, and kind've accepted it. I don't think I snapped out of it until my friend grabbed me and asked if I was alright. Even after I felt as though I was in a disney world for the next ten minutes, I specifically remember thinking the fairy god mother was with me leading me along. After I synced back with reality a little bit I got unbelievably cold and sat in my bed, crying over the thought of my dog that died a year earlier.

You read somewhere on the internet that the ionosphere (yeah, that's up in the sky, way above the /r/trees - REALLY high) can *bounce light back to the earth* if the light is the right color. You read a bit more and find out that different heights do different things and that if you get just the RIGHT color, you can actually bounce it down, up, down, up and then down again to the *other side of the planet*. Like god's fiber optics in the sky. Deep shit.

So you screw around by adjusting the color and you send a message in morse code. Or if you're really fancy you change the color of the light depending on the waveform of your own voice. You actually get *just* the right frequency so that the light is visible (just barely) to somebody that lives 8,000 miles away.

And here's the really crazy shit: not only does somebody over there see the light and decode the morse code (or your voice), they *send you a message back*. Apparently this guy (or hot, sexy blonde danish woman, if you prefer, but you know it's a guy so that's just a fantasy) saw the same instructables article as you and bought the same kit from some website somewhere. 

And you guys talk for a while. But really it's way more fun to try and see if you can find somebody in a whole different country on the other side of the world. Eventually you decide that if you're really a badass with this thing that you can reach somebody in every country in the world if you really try hard enough. So you sit up late at night, or you spend your entire weekends morning and afternoon, trying to reach people with your little light (which you put on top of your house now, just because it's easier). And, well, you start to look like somebody that hasn't come out of a cave in a while, but you're sort of obsessed and you just can't stop now anyway.

But it's not enough... you decide to bounce that light off of the moon (OK, you need a slightly brighter light here) or bounce it off of freaking meteor trails. Or you decide you are only going to use ultraviolet light that doesn't bounce of of the sky, but that's cool because you can use your grow light and a filter and it doesn't cost you any extra and hey, that thing's pretty bright maybe it will work. Or maybe a blacklight if you started smoking trees in the 70s.

I advocate waiting until your animals are grown as we're not sure of possible issues with childhood use, so I'm not really for intentionally getting kittens or puppies baked, but if your grown animals always seem to hang around extra close when you're smoking, it's likely because they too, enjoy getting baked.

This is an 18+ subreddit, so you're obviously 18+.  You've attained your majority.  That means your parents have discharged their legal obligations to you.  The fact they still allow you to hang around, and presumably buy you food and other material goods, likely means they give a shit about you.  That makes you lucky.  Not everyone who wants that gets to have that.

Part of becoming an adult involves taking responsibility for your actions.  That means if you live in your parents house, then you should have enough respect for them to follow their rules.

Once you're off their property, then they no longer have any legal interest in your behavior.  If you want to smoke weed off their property, this then becomes a matter between you and your government.  So if you want to smoke, go for a walk.  Figure out a way to keep your stash out of your parent's house.

If alcohol were to be invented tomorrow, it would be illegal, and that is a fact. However, abuse of any drug (Alcohol, cannabis or any other) is dangerous. Weed is great for unwinding at the end of a stressful day, or hanging out with friends, but it's not good to become dependent on weed at all. Weed should enhance a good life, not be the focus of it.

It is also a historic symbol found in almost every culture with different significance. It is known outside Asia as the Hakenkreuz, gammadion cross, cross cramponnée, croix gammée, fylfot, or tetraskelion. A swastika generally takes the form of a symmetrically arranged equilateral cross with four legs each bent at 90 degrees.

Reddit is a place that is pro weed. It's like pointing out to High Times that there are other times to focus on and not all High Times are good times. They're not going to dedicate an issue about baking and going to a wake. 

Frankly, the downsides are no big fucking deal, especially compared to almost any other popular substance. People like to dump their problems on substances and associate certain behaviors, but that's usually a correlation made by the person. Also, crazy fucking idea, maybe how it affects one person doesn't apply for everyone else?

99% of reddit anti-weed stuff is all bro-science and popular opinion (e.g. ""I stopped smoking and X happened.""). Well what about the sober person lighting up that stopped lighting up? Could it be something else that changed in the person that *coincedently* changed how they thought about getting high?

26499,"&gt;you are insiting on ignoring what falsification actually means.

Actually it is you who is ignoring what it actually means.

     Falsifiability or refutability is the logical possibility that an assertion can be contradicted by an observation or 
     the outcome of a physical experiment. That something is ""falsifiable"" does not mean it is false; rather, that if  
     it is false, then some observation or experiment will produce a reproducible result that is in conflict with it.

People do not rise from the dead. It has been observed that no one ever has. Your theory, claim, hypothesis what have you, is falsified. 

&gt;You don't try to prove a hypothesis right. You try to prove them wrong. 

No one has ever risen from the dead after three days. You need to show proof that YOU are making a valid claim. You cannot.  Like I asked, and you ignored, what about all those other ""gods"" who ""rose"" from the dead? Are you saying they exist and are true because they are not falsified? Hmmmm? Can you answer the question? My guess is no.

I couldnt believe he said that being against weed, but it made me happy my brother loves me enough to support me too.

edit after found out youre 19: damn man, it might be a bit late to rebel.

Flower power was a slogan used during the late 1960s and early 1970s as a symbol of passive resistance and non-violence ideology. It is rooted in the opposition movement to the Vietnam War. The expression was coined by the American beat poet Allen Ginsberg in 1965 as a means to transform war protests into peaceful affirmative spectacles. Hippies embraced the symbolism by dressing in clothing with embroidered flowers and vibrant colors, wearing flowers in their hair, and distributing flowers to the public, becoming known as flower children.

Stop smoking 48 hours before your test.  Buy yourself some kind of multivatmin(make sure its a multimineral as well, pretty much all of them are, but some are werid), but some B12 pills, and buy yourself about half a gallon of gatorade.  You are going to want to drink about half a gallon of water starting hour 48 prior-24.  After you have finished that first half gallon, start on the gatorade, drink about a quart the day before and take two multivatmins, one in the morning, one in the evening, same with the B12.  Wake up the day  of your test at least 3 hours before, drink the rest of the gatorade (NO WATER), take one multivamin as soon as you wake up, and one right before you leave to go to your test, same with the B12.  Now make sure you have pee'd at least 2 times the morning of the test (do not count your first pee of the morning.  So ideally the pee for your test should be your 4th pee of the day, make sure you are not holding it in.  If you have had an overwhelming urge to pee for more than about 30 minutes, you may pass the 20ng mark.  But most piss tests test at 50ng anyway, and if you pee diluted they go for the 20ng in a lab.",trees

This kind of cyclical coverage happens because many in the trees community are not active consumers of media/news, which actually diminishes their standings in the democratic process (one must be informed to have an effect within the halls of representative governance). 

To that end, encouraging these kind of articles (even if they are outdated) engenders the standing of the individual person in the lawmaking process, as the point is not so much to break a ""new story"", but rather teach all in the community about something they may have missed due to the transient nature of reddit's day to day userbase.

To that end, we must inculcate an ethos which encourages (not shames) posting information about ongoing political issues; as, in this way, we take back the halls of government and force the bells of democracy to toll once more.

To do otherwise invites a literal conflagration of monied faction to take over the law making process (as Madison warned of in Federalist no.10-http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed10.asp), which would end up swallowing whole the very oxygen the union needs to breathe (that essential freedom and liberty for which it was first conceived).",trees

""Well you see,"" Roshi replied, ""for most people, and especially for most educated people like you and I, what we perceive and experience is heavily mediated, through language and concepts that are deeply ingrained in our ways of thinking and feeling. Our objective here is to induce in ourselves and in each other a psychological state that involves the unmediated experience of the world, because we believe that that state has certain desirable properties. It's impossible in general to reach that state through any particular form or method, since forms and methods are themselves examples of the mediators that we are trying to avoid. So we employ a variety of ad hoc means, some linguistic like koans and some non-linguistic like zazen, in hopes that for any given student one or more of our methods will, in whatever way, engender the condition of non-mediated experience that is our goal. And since even thinking in terms of mediators and goals tends to reinforce our undesirable dependency on concepts, we actively discourage exactly this kind of analytical discourse.""

To me dabs have always been WAY harsher. I am coughing for like 15 minutes and my eyes water. My lungs usually hurt for a day or two after. Not to mention all the butane and often hexane used in making shatter that people love. But CO2 extraction is probably way more common now. I also have rarely done my own dabs. It's usually when I am over at one of my ""stoner 4 lyfe"" friend's house and they offer and I once in a while say sure.

For me dabs have been even harsher than a blunt or a joint, which I really only do at concerts now. I have gotten to become an expert at cornering flower in pipe on the other hand so that I almost never get ash at all. I have greens always in the second to last hit and often in the last one.

I have a question though, on principle what's wrong with a regulated free market with social services as an underlying stabilizing force?

We must realize as an emergent form industry will always fight state ownership, so why not build a system from the ground up that regulates the market rather than just takes it over?

To me, socialists, social democrats, democratic socialists, and liberals are all united by two common enemies; neo-liberalism (which masquerades as ""modern liberalism"", but is in fact hard right conservatism on par with the 1980's....as Francis Fukuyama found out when he realized that PNAC and the neo-con/neo-libs manipulated his theory in ""End of History"" to justify american fiscal (rather than ethical) hegemony)...and neo-conservatism.  Both of which we can only beat as a unified liberal base (as the last election showed). 


I guess my question to you becomes; why can't all rational social leftists accept John Rawls (Political Liberalism/Law of Peoples Rawls, not Theory of Justice Rawls) as the happy medium which will allow (at least in America) the party to unite behind a core moral/ethical maxim as to the markets and actually take back power in 2020 with Warren?",trees

Its quite useful, and poses a huge threat to vested corporate interests. In fact, hemp was once the largest and most important industry in the United States, even before the US was a country. 

Facts:

The first 2 copies of the Declaration of Independence are on hemp paper, a paper which proves to be superior in nearly every way to tree pulp based paper.

Ethanol from hemp is far more carbon efficient than corn based biofuel, plastics from hemp are biodegradable and stronger than petroleum based products. In fact, [this](http://hempcar.org/ford.shtml).

Hemp seeds contain lots of amino acids and vitamins and are considered a ""superfood"".

Cordage and fabric from hemp are much more durable than their cotton counterparts.

Cultivation of hemp has lasted as long as human civilization and it is one of the most useful and important crops we have. However, it is profitable to some corporate interests to have weed be illegal, every industry where hemp has a potential application as a competitor product will fight to keep it illegal because such a transition would be expensive and destabilize the market.

I give you this preface because as a result of this I've put a LOT of time and thought into discretion at home. Your best bet is a handheld vape. No scent, isn't immediately identifiable as paraphernalia, healthier, and keeps the smoke from clinging to the walls and creating an unhealthy environment for your child. Keep it in a safe along with your bag - Yes, bag. If you want to be as safe as absolutely possible, you need to come to terms with the fact that bags are simply a lot easier to hide and with a safe you won't really have to worry about the smell getting through. Say goodbye to your stash jar, or spring for a larger and presumably more expensive safe. A lot of head shops sell stash jars that are soda cans. They are perfectly weighted to feel like a normal can of soda and it's nigh impossible to realize what your'e holding unless you already know they exist. OR..... Just move to a state with medical =D That's my plan. With 1 in 3 states experimenting with some form of legalization or decriminalization, you can expect your options to expand significantly in the coming decade.

Here's some rules, people:

1 - First meeting needs to be in a public space, like a bar, cafe, festival..etc

2 - Don't mention anything incriminating during your Reddit correspondence. This is good = ""Wanna grab a beer?"" This is not good = ""Wanna meet and smoke some marijuana?""

3 - When you meet in real life, talk casually first and when you feel it's safe to proceed, ask each other ""Are you a cop?"" or a variant of that. This is important because a law officer must tell you the truth, even if it's a drug arrest sting. Otherwise, it will be very easy for your lawyer to have your case thrown out.

4 - Until Cannabis is legal, we have to be careful about what we say and do in front of strangers. But we must remember that there are some of us out there who are friendly.

I was a little crazy as a youth (15 years old) and I got sent away to be evaluated at a hospital and they would up drugging me and I woke up in some ward and they kept me there for 3 weeks.
Then I was able to go home for the first time. 
I went down to my room, which was in the basement and I was stuck there as a bunch of adults sat upstairs.
I knew that I had some weed, somewhere, even if it was only rez. Then I realized that I had nothing, no papers, no lighter...nothing.
Feeling like shit, I decided to search everywhere and I eventually stumbled upon a CD case with a pack of rolling papers in it.
Minutes later I found a lighter.
It was a little frustrating because I now knew that I had everything in the making except for the weed. I had no escape from the basement, but the basement had windows. All I needed was some herb, even if I just found a roach, I could empty it into the new paper. I had been nearly a month without smoking, I knew that shit would get me high.

So I am digging through all my drawers and I began to notice small accumulations here and there and I start to put them together. This may be the smallest joint ever, but it *will be* a joint.

So I began to realize how hard it is going to be to roll this thing. But I have nothing but time on my side. I figured I could really take my time and produce a perfect little pin-joint that will probably burn to ash within 2 hits. But I *would* get two hits.

Fuck. This is going to take a while. I should put on some music. I press the CD-tray eject to put in a CD but nothing happens. WTF? I begin to try everything, from sticking a knife into the ejector to banging the top of the player. Nothing works.

O' Hell No. You can take my weed God, but you wont take my music too. Not today. I unplug the CD player and begin to go nuts trying to get the ejector to open. Now that it is unplugged, I really cram the knife into the slit and I begin to work that shit. Remember, this was back in the 90's where the CD went on a little tray that sucked in and out of the machine.

So I get it to budge and I grab the tip of the CD tray. I am pulling but it feels like something is stuck. As I yank, I realize that there *is* something stuck inside the CD player.

I then get a flashback to the last 15 minutes before being sent away, my parents bugging out, me thinking I needed to find a place to hide my stash. A place that nobody would ever find it. I was also at a solid [10] while planning this out, because I knew that they may try to keep me at the hospital for more than a night, I knew my parents tricks.

As I finally get the CD tray to come out, what do I see? A huge quarter of bud in a plastic bag that is nearly ripped to shit.

It sounds like your version of a blunt is what we would call a joint, and your version of a joint is what we would call a spliff.",trees

You take your weed, use a blast freezer/grinder to dash freeze the weed and then literal turn it to dust. You then measure out a small amount of that weed dust, add a set amount of MeOH and then vortex. The MeOH pulls out all the canabanoids and we inject a small amount of that into an HPLC. The HPLC has an isocratic method so the most polar compounds go though the column fastest, which the less plait stuff taking longer. Because the polarity of each canabanoid vary slightly we can use this to separate out all the different canabanoids and get a distinct peak for each one. For edibles and other oil beard stuff we use a different solvent besides MeOH. Usually NPA or 2-butoxyethanol (sp?)",trees

63003,"Here's an account of my first breakthrough Salvia experience (which is also the first trip I've ever had):    
    
Back in 2005/06 I played around with Salvia a few times. It was legal in PA, although the main reason I was doing it was because I was already being drug tested as part of signing up for the Navy. I tried hard to get regular dried leaves to work, but I didn't really feel anything substantial until I got my hands on some 13x extract.    
    
Set/Setting: Friend's House (Basement)  
Time: Early Evening    
    
T+0s: Took a large hit via bong of Salvia 13x extract. I looked around at my 3 friends as I held it in (we were all sitting in a circle around a candle on the floor), and I exhaled shortly after.    
T+10s: Lost track of peripheral vision; candle flame began to smear; tracers accompanied movement.    
T+20s: Was zoned out on a tingling sensation all over my body, along with what sounded like howling wind all around me. I saw the candle flame fall down and disappear, which briefly startled me, until I realized it was ME that was falling backwards, because gravity decided to change on me. I found this funny, so as I was falling I looked at my best friend on my right and giggled.    
T+30s: I didn't know if my eyes were open or closed. I was flat on my back looking up at the ceiling, yet in my mind I was looking down through the floor I was laying on. Gravity got really heavy. I felt as if I was being sucked into a black hole. My legs and torso were stretching out like a piece of taffy, into the floor.    
T+?: I lifted my neck to look at my feet, but I couldn't find them. They were already sucked into the floor, being pulled into a completely separate dimension. This dimension was cubic in shape, yet all sides stretched off into infinity. I was looking at the center of this cubic universe, from which a thin, flat ribbon stretched from one end to the center, did a loop, then continued on to the other end. Upon closer inspection I realize this ribbon was made up of tiny squares with a single dot in the middle. They resembled plant cells, yet instead of containing genetic material, these cells were the building blocks/instructions for our reality.    
T+??: With horror I discovered that my body has already been stretched out all the way up to its waist, and was being sucked into this ribbon, slowly becoming a part of it. I felt for my arms, but couldn't feel them. The floor was up to the bottom of my rib cage now. I summoned every remaining ounce of strength I had left to open my eyes (I guess they were closed), look at my friends, and blurted out a weak, ""help me...,"" to which they all laughed. I then realized I was at the butt end of a universal joke.    
T+???: I felt played. I was devastated. Not only was I about to stop existing, all of my friendships had been a lie. With this I silently resigned to my fate, my eyes beginning to tear up. The floor was up to my neck when suddenly...    
T+?!?!: It stopped! I finally stopped being sucked into the floor! I quickly start feeling my arms and torso again, to which I promptly shot myself right up off the floor, tripped and fell over, stood up again, then nervously paced around for about a minute, afraid that if I stopped I'd be sucked back into the floor again.    
    
Total experience time was about 5 minutes, although ever since that experience I've always had some slight level of disassociation with reality. It was so real it caused me to completely question my existence. Hell, sometimes I ponder if I'm still in the middle of the 
same salvia experience to this very day. After all, time is completely meaningless on salvia.

I use index cards, cut into maybe half inch strips. Fold the end (maybe like an eighth inch), and again a few times until you have a little zig zag. Roll the paper around that - the tube should have some zig zags in the middle. Put that in the end of the rolling paper, so that like a little bit is protruding from the end. After you roll you'll push that into the joint to help pack. Put your ground bud in the rolling paper, enough so that you can wrap the paper around. Lick the glue, tuck the paper at the filter, and carefully roll it. Stick it, and pack the weed into the joint. I use the end of a pencil since it's what I have. Carefully load some more bud until it's *almost* full, then twist the end to close it up. Light up, enjoy.

I have about 20 subreddits I go through and I try to spread it out.

Most likely I will be adding binging with babish as people love those, but I am unsure if it should be included.

When it comes to cannabis I have about 10 subreddits I go through.  I always try to add at least 2 international pieces.  Then I look at the publish dates for top stories.  Determine if they are news or not.  So for example a TIL is not really news as its not happening in the previous week, but a study just released about a TIL would be news.
