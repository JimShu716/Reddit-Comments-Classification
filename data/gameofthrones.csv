I felt like that and threatening to burn Varys were both pretty intense. Those actions don't align with the ruler she claims to want to be, but I feel like a lot of things she's done don't align with that vision, so it's hard to call for me.

Yeah, I suppose she has. That said, she tends to be consistently calculated. She understands human behaviour and plans accordingly. That was seen with Varys, she understood he may betray her if he doesn't like what she does, but she snapped that in the bud. She acknowledged that the people of Westeros aren't just anxiously awaiting her return, and have their own problems.

Having said that, if you didn't ride hard but instead conserved your mount's stamina and also didn't load it heavily then you could probably travel twice as fast as on foot because you'd be moving more quickly (on average) and require fewer rest breaks.   ",gameofthrones

I have seen the Redding Scene like almost 15 times and the first 5 times Will went right past me, after that I kept looking ""oh, that dude sure looks like Will"" and forgot about it.

It botters and brakes the immersion. My girlfriend didn't recognize him so it wasn't that bad for her, but she thought that this must be new important character cause he's so much in screen.

Also Jon is just getting lucky with his choices and has plot armor. Otherwise he would be fucked because of his bad choices in the past.   
He got captured by the free folk, he got the head ranger killed by the free folk, he got himself stabbed to death, he got his army surrounded and slaughtered before the vale came and saved him. If not for luck, the help of others, and literally the plot requiring him to be risen from the dead, right now Jon would be 6 ft under, a white walker, or burned.   


In reality giving those kids their castles isnt a good move. Like sansa said it rewards houses that betrayed you, punishes those that stood by you, and they are kids so those houses will be weakly led.     
Would be much better to give them to allies and cement their loyalty, allow the kids to remain in the castles as adopted orphans of the new ruling family, and everything and everyone is happy.   
  
As far as going to see danny it is debatable who is right. Both make good points but if we go on only the knowledge they have and not the knowledge that we have. (They dont know Danny's plan or that she is nice. In fact they assume the opposite and she takes after her father.) With that knowledge the choice is very clear. Jon shouldnt go. In fact danny if she wants his support and is asking him a favor should be coming to him. Not ordering him to come to her and bend the knee. I think that really shows that danny isnt a good ruler but a good conqueror. She doesn't say ""i need X from you so i will give you Y in return."" She says ""give me X or I will end you.""

Sansa has been through 6 seasons of hell and just when she finally has family and someone she completely trusts, he wants to go, in her eyes, the path of honor that got the rest of her family killed.

It comes off as stupid because we, the audience, knows what she doesn't, and are super hype for a DanyxJon meeting, but from Sansa's POV, all of her resistance comes from trying to protect Jon and keep him alive. That's why it doesn't bother me.

It's on my list of worst scenes in the show because a conflict was immediately resolved in one of the most unbelievable, strange and bullshit methods possible.

6480,"That was her reply exactly. My interpretation was that she feels like she is an experienced leader or at least someone capable of advising a leader while her only experience is being in proximity to Kings and Cersei, and not while they're doing anything related to leading.  

Meanwhile John has been Lord Commander for who knows how long, he convinced a council that lead the free folk to trust him and betray their ways in doing so.  Then he convinced the free folk and several northern houses to fight with him and take Winterfell (with help from Davos, the only thing Sansa did was completely misread Leanna Mormont and insult her as a potential great beauty and insult Lord Glover after his mind was made up, a move Jon visibly knew had 0% chance of working).  

Sansa's only contribution (while obviously not minor) has been the Nights of the Vale.  Even with that aid, she left Jon completely in the dark and she is lucky he didn't get killed again on multiple occasions (Cavalry charge timing, arrows falling around him, crush scene, etc), unless of couse she wanted him to die.  I don't think that's the case I think it's just a good example of how oblivious she is about the impact of her actions. 

TLDR:  My interpretation is that Sansa thinks she's qualified to advise when in reality she has very little practical experience. She may know some nuance about how people like Cersei and Littlefinger work, but in general Jon has much better leadership capabilities from practical experience. ",gameofthrones

7764,"I think it's entirely possible that Robin is LF's son.  It would explain why Lysa fawns over him so much.  She is and has been obsessed with Littlefinger her whole life.  Jon Arryn was light haired and a hearty if older man.  Physically Robin favors LF.  Perhaps, Jon began to suspect something peculiar and that's what lead him to the book that records all the births of noble houses.  I'd wager Jon was investigating his own house's genealogy (at least initially) and that is what prompted LF to get Lysa to poison Jon. 

Littlefinger plays the long con. Always several steps ahead.  Suppose Jon was sterile... Littlefinger to the rescue!  He gives Lysa an Arryn heir that is his son. This keeps Lysa in his pocket for as long as he needs. And makes it easy to convince her to murder her husband.  Because then she murders Jon Arryn to protect herself, LF, and their son, Robin.  

Also, her son is named after a bird.  Lol, while Robins don't look like mockingbirds.  It could be a little nod to his true Biological father. Both are small aggressive birds.

Both the Hound and Arya are refugees of a cruel and violent world, made violent killers by it. The difference is that over time, the Hound has started to see some good in the world.

Last year when I was trying to understand the events of Hodor's story in 'Hold the Door,' the only way it made sense is to imagine the entire 8 seasons as a book that has already been written. It's going to play out the way it is supposed to. Bran is someone who can freely flip through the pages and revisit any previous points in the story (as we've seen him do multiple times last season), as well as flip forward and see what's to come before the story actually gets there. 

He was able to visit a younger Hodor and open the gates for him to experience his older self, which fried his mind. What Bran did is very similar to how while reading, sometimes we hold the page we are on with our finger, and flip back to an earlier part of the book. I'm sure Bran can hold the page he's on and also flip forward to see what's coming. That's just how I see it anyway. Open to any discussion as always.

8256,"Just had some counter-arguments I wanted to make.

&gt; Dany's dragons and her large army didn't help her much in Meereen so they are less effective at subduing a population than one would suspect.

This is saying a lot without really providing context. The problem with Meereen was how they were attacked. Also, Dany and co. didn't actually *know* the enemy, in the sense that they didn't *know* where/who to attack to stop it. Once they did, Dany burnt their fleet to the ground and killed 3 of their leaders. Pretty damn effective, if you ask me.

Unlike Meereen, Dany is going into the battle knowing who the enemy is, and the enemy isn't going to be able to hide in the shadows for long. Cersei will be forced to address Dany.

&gt; Wage a propaganda campaign against the Targaryens. Make Dany into a foreigner and a tyrant seeking to subjugate and oppress Westeros. Remind people of Dany's cray-cray father. Heck, blame Varys or Tyrion or some Targ loyalists for burning the Sept to the ground.

First off, no one in King's Landing considers Cersei in a positive manner. The general populace loathes her, and know the real kind of danger they are in with her at the helm. To suggest she could spin some shit to make the rightful Queen, who carries titles such as the Breaker of Chains, into a bad person, is just silly. Also, that isn't Cersei's style. She doesn't give a fuck what the public thinks of her, and loathes them equally as intensely as they for her. She'd rather burn them all then try and play some petty little opinion game. 

This isn't High School; Dany has fucking fire-breathing dragons. The popular kid doesn't win here.

&gt; Ally with Euron and have him raid Dany's allies in Dorne and the Reach. Make it impossible for them to aid Dany because they have to defend their territories. Make both kingdom's banners, especially the Reach's banners, restless and ready to turn on Elia/Sandsnakes and Oleanna Tyrell. Promise lands to any defectors.

Totally reasonable. Euron is obviously aiding her, and the trailer suggests he's attacking them in open water. There is far too much to be gained by trying to disrupt Dany's allies while she is still traveling/plotting. This is the most logical move, and the most likely to happen. I see her trying to split Dany's group as soon as possible.

&gt; Ally with the North. Give Jon what he wants, men to defend the Wall. Sign a non-aggression pact with the North which acknowledges their independence. This will mean that Dany has to fight a war on two fronts; she would have to subdue the North as well because she wants everyone in Westeros to kneel to her. (Of course, Cersei won't do this either for the same power-hungry reason. I don't think that Tywin would either. However, a more reasonable Lannister like Tyrion or Kevan probably would see the value in making this move.)

That will never happen. Both sides are far too gone for such a truce, particularly when the obvious choice for Jon and the North would be to aid with the chick who has dragons, and who's ancestors allowed the Starks to rule the North after the Targs took control of Westeros.


Truth be told, Cersei and the Lannisters are a sinking ship. It would take a fucking miracle to revive them now, and even a further miracle to see them survive the shit storm coming their way. Cersei's diversion/division tactics will certainly have some effect, and Cersei will obviously gain some small victories, but Dany's dragons trump it all. Even with just Drogon, who is now a certified fucking monster, she can turn the tide in her favor to tremendous effect. The fact she obviously still had enough men to have the Doth Raki in open battle in one of those scenes, shows that the division tactic probably didn't do enough to stop what is coming for Cersei.

Honestly, Cersei's only chances for survival/victory hinge on what happens in the North, or if Euron *actually* has a Dragon Horn. At this point, it seems reasonable to believe that Euron has a horn, but what it will actually do in the show versus what it is said to do in the book, make it hard to really tell where they are going with it.

Finally, Cersei has the option to level the city with wildfire. It isn't below her to hold the city and it's people hostage, knowing the importance that Dany places in saving innocent lives. I'd be more inclined to believe that Cersei will level the city rather than give it up to Dany. It makes me wonder if Arya could have a part to play in that sequence of events that will lead up to Cersei's downfall, and Dany's eventual taking of King's Landing. Arya would fulfill the theory of her being the one to kill Cersei as per the prophecy from that crazy witch, and would give a smooth transition into an alliance for a bigger cause between the North and Dany.

9781,"I can definitely see the first part happening, especially with Jon, but I think Sansa is gonna get Littlefinger got.",gameofthrones
9805,"I thought this was a pretty good episode with some really interesting themes running throughout. 

What was particularly interesting was seeing the subtle hints about a divide in between Cersei and Jaime. We see him claim that he is loyal to Cersei and that he backs her up, but does he fully do so in his heart? Cersei took great delight in killing Tyene in as cruel a way as possible. Jaime on the other hand chose to kill Olenna as compassionately as he could, without taunting her. Even when he found out at the last minute that Olenna had conspired to kill Joffrey, he still allowed her that peaceful death - leaving the room instead of being violent at the last moment. It shows how they respond differently and think differently.  

I wonder how much of an impact Olenna's comments will have on him in the long run? 

EDIT: I just recalled another difference between Cersei and Jaime. Jaime admits he cares about Casterly Rock, Cersei doesn't. What does this say about them, has Cersei moved on in a way that Jaime hasn't?

Another interesting comparison was between Cersei and Olenna. When Cersei was torturing the Sand Snakes she mentioned how she struggled to sleep at night. Olenna on the other hand said that she never had trouble sleeping no matter what she did because she believed she was right. Does this hint at Olenna being a mentally stronger person then Cersei? Does it mean that Olenna's actions had some moral justification whereas Cersei's are beyond the pale? Or that Cersei will eventually snap under the weight of ruling.  

It was also fascinating to see the difference between Sam's bravery and compassion for Jorah, in an episode filled with cruelty and violence. It does show that compassion can have a value in Westeros. Also, did anyone think that copying out manuscripts was definitely not a punishment? I would have loved doing that! 

Now we know the value of the advice Olenna gave Dany in the previous episode. Dany's instinct was to seek out Euron's fleet with her dragons and destroy it. She was talked out of it by her advisors and that reining in of her dragon instinct cost her dearly, taking out the remains of her fleet and a much needed ally, ironically ending the life of the woman who gave her the advice. 

It's going to be interesting to see how the situation between Dany and Jon plays out. The scene in which their various titles were read out could not have made the difference between their leadership styles and views on the world clearer. Jon, for all his humbleness, demonstrated that he has a much better grip on affairs in Westeros then Dany. Jon walked away from the negotiations with everything he wanted. Dany failed in her goals to get Jon to bend the knee, at least for now. In fact Dany has had nothing but failures since landing at Dragon Stone. 

We saw Cersei compared with Tywin in several ways, both in Cersei's conversation with the representative of the Iron Bank, and when Tyrion was discussing her with the others. So far Cersei's choices have appeared to be good ones, but at what cost? There is a reason Tywin didn't just take Highgarden when he needed money, he knew the cost of doing so would be too high. Tywin's ruthlessness against his own family eventually cost him his life, Tyrion wouldn't be where he is now if Tywin had not done that. Where will Cersei's ruthlessness eventually take her? 

We also got to see Sansa's leadership style contrasted with Jons. I felt this scene was slightly clumsy which was a shame, seeing her suggest adaptations to the armour felt a bit silly. Surely the armourers would have thought of that. Anyway it was still enlightening, Sansa seemed to take to command much more naturally and was more comfortable with giving orders then Jon is. Jon always seems reluctant and even admitted in his conversation with Dany that he doesn't enjoy being a leader. Sansa on the other hand seemed to relish it. Will she feel differently when she has to live with the consequences of her decisions and their effects on others - for good or ill?

My favorite is the part where the brotherhood without banners would've found Caitlin Stark wash up in the river, and instead the Hound is pissing in that river. The obvious metaphor being them pissing on the original storyline. Really reminds me of something Kubrick put into The Shining, where the cook is rushing back to the hotel in a yellow Beetle, and passes a red Beetle smashed up on the side of the road. In the book The Shining, he drove a red Beetle lol. It's a way for the writers/producers/director to subtlety say they are taking control for themselves.

You attribute that to her like she did it on purpose, when in reality it was a present that was handed to her by Illyrio who was an advisor to her and her brother. The Dothraki marriage was also his idea, and he was the reason she and her brother got the Dothraki army. The Unsullied was handed to her by one of those 'idiot adversaries' I mentioned because he thought he could have a dragon on a leash. She didn't have to fight for that, it it was hardly a clever ploy.

In other words, the three biggest accomplishments you attribute to her can barely be called her accomplishments. She got the second son army because its leader was blown away by her beauty. She got ships handed to her by the Greyjoy siblings because they happened to have no other option. She'd already be dead and poisoned by now in season one if she wasn't saved by Jorah, yet another advisor. Her imprisoning of her dragons was a huge mess up Tyrion remedied. He was also the one who got the Harpy leaders out of hiding and in one spot to deal with. Yet another win thanks an advisor because she couldn't handle enemies she couldn't see.

As far as attacking the Unsullied, I think he only arrived after the seige of/battle for Casterly Rock had taken place. You see him starting to attack the Unsullied ships in the bay. We sort of just got a quick rundown of how it went down but I imagine the Unsullied didn't take the Rock on the day they got there. It probably took a while.

Many people believe the fire is from Dany's dragons, but it could be that Dany's dragons are not there at all and it was some sort of guerrilla-like attack by Euron in the middle of the night. The fire might be from Euron's men using fire arrows or something with flammable liquid (Westerosi molotovs, made out rum maybe?) to burn down sails and immobilize part of the fleet?

15976,"Well i dont think Olenna was involved in getting tyrion framed. She wanted joffrey to die and for it to look like he choked on a pie. Littlefinger had his secret motive to frame tyrion because he wanted sansa to become a widow as its vital to his plans. And in the books basically everyone(well besides stannis and tyrion) thinks that littlefinger is this friendly helpful guy so I doubt Olenna even knows he framed tyrion. I dont think its explicitly stated that he framed tyrion in the show but heres a quote from the books:

&gt;Tell me of the feast. The queen took such pains. The singers, the jugglers, the dancing bear . . . did your little lord husband enjoy my jousting dwarfs?"" ""Yours?"" ""I had to send to Braavos for them and hide them away in a brothel until the wedding. The expense was exceeded only by the bother. It is surprisingly difficult to hide a dwarf, and Joffrey . . . you can lead a king to water, but with Joff one had to splash it about before he realized he could drink it. When I told him about my little surprise, His Grace said, 'Why would I want some ugly dwarfs at my feast? I hate dwarfs.' I had to take him by the shoulder and whisper, 'Not as much as your uncle will.'""

I wondered if Cercei was going to die this season, but I think she will make it until the end with Jon and Dany.  Her being killed by Jamie would have been huge.

They are big-boned and massively muscled, with long arms, sloped foreheads, huge square teeth, heavy jaws and coarse black hair. Their broad, flat noses suggest snouts. Sothoryi women are said to be unable to breed with men from Essos or Westeros, only bringing forth stillbirths or malformed offspring.*

&gt; *The Sothoryi mostly known to the corsairs of the neighbouring Basilisk Isles are those who dwell closest to the sea on the Northern shore, who have learned the Trade Talk. The Ghiscari consider them to be slow of wit but fierce fighters that make good slaves. Farther south, the Sothoryi from these regions are more savage, known for cannibalism and worshiping dark gods with obscene rites. There are also unproven reports of other races and forgotten peoples that were driven out, destroyed, or devoured by the Brindled Men, as well lizard men and eyeless cave-dwellers.*

She bluntly told Jon she's more worried about Cersei and so is playing the best southern game she can (personally I think her attempt to ""undermine"" Jon might have been part of a show for Littlefinger). She learned from Cersei you have to be cold and hard if you want to survive the game of thrones because although Cersei might not be in the best position now, she survived damn longer than Sansa's family. Jon is focused on the war to the north, which requires a strategy of unity.  Neither of the Starks are wrong,  they just are focusing on two different problems.  Perhaps with Jon's military command and Sansa's machinations they can stave off the conflicts they are sandwiched between. ",gameofthrones

He only hear about him king slaying.

16337,"Why would Euron lose any ships? He has ranged capability with those catapults. He would have won at sea with little to no cost. He completely destroyed the other Ironborn fleet, and the ships that the Unsullied took to Casterly Rock weren't exactly empty when they were being destroyed by Euron. There hasn't been a single justification that makes sense with the information the show has given us. ",gameofthrones
16416,"Dany's had some pretty serious advantages her whole life. She definitely earned the respect of the folks that followed her through the Red Waste, but honestly, where are those folks now? Does she even know? Does she care? If she does, why isn't she still in Slaver's Bay, fixing those problems, making those lives better? 

This isn't a college application, where she mentions that she helped some folks in Essos once, so now has freedom to move on to bigger things. Conquering the world does tend to take time away from seeing to the needs of the people. Helping ""the people"" seems to have gotten lost in her obsession with conquering the kingdom that overthrew her family for being prideful, overly ambitious, and tyrannical - which are kind-of the very characteristics she's beginning to display.  

I'm not saying that she's not admirable. She's one of the best characters on the show. The scene where the people begin calling her Myhsa and touching her is one of the best moments in the early seasons, and to be honest, through all of the Jofrrey and Ramsey mess, I've been dying to see her finally tear into the Lannisters.

It won't be revealed to Jon before he meets Dany and I can't see it being revealed until it makes it tragic. i.e. He falls in love with her, fights against her and wins, fights against her and loses or has some power dragon over a dragon.  

Jon's luck is always a bit shitty so can't see it changing.  

Plus it would make more sense for LF to tell Sansa to show how Jon has more legitimacy than her as she would seem more likely to want to rule than Jon who only really wants the position to fight the WW.  ",gameofthrones

16518,"I wouldn't say everything was handed to her. From a storywriting perspective it just seems too often too convenient.

She needs an army? Oh, how good there is one to buy in the middle of nowhere. She does orchestrate a plan to steal this army, yes. But again: How convenient that the unsullied follow without further question the one who is carrying the whip.

She lost her dothraki? Let's get abducted, how convenient that there is this giant dothraki army. Again she DOES actually do something (although it is only burning some guys) but again: army just waiting to be taken.

She needs ships? Here are the Greyjoys. She has to bargain with them. But again, how convenient of them to show up.

I would not say she is handed everything. But the story hands her a lot of opportunities (which she actually does take - that's on her). It starts to feel like lazy writing sometimes and her cocky behaviour does not reflect how much luck (meaning the opportunites that she was given not her skills in using them) she had. That makes a lot of people (or at least me) not like her.

EDIT: Let me add one thing because people want to compare her to Jon: Jon never felt too strong to be harmed. In Danerys story I never had the feeling that there was an enemy who could seriously harm her (now that she has come to Westeros that is starting to change). Jon was killed, Jon almost lost the battle against the Boltons. He feels less overpowered.

I remember the moment when the Stark-banners were put on Winterfell after the battle of the bastards. For a second I thought it wouldn’t be the wolf of house stark but Littlefinger’s bird because he actually had the strongest army at that point and could have taken Winterfell easily. In Danery’s case I just would have thought ‘whatever, if someone tried to do something like that to her, she’d just burn them and take their army - because people tend to follow her when she burns their leader.”

24696,"the book and show might be blurring together in my memory on some of my points

joffery: she takes his side during the incident were the butchers kid gets killed and her wolf has to be put down, it is pretty clear at that point that joffery wasn't very nice. however she keeps looking forward to being married to him even after they get to kings landing. 


convincing ned:in the books she asks ned to confess and take the black and works on cersei's behalf to get ned to publicly admit that joffery is the legitimate heir. i think she visits him in while he is imprisoned too. I guess i got the book and show mixed up. sansa thinks she is saving her dad, but she still is a cog in the machine that gets ned killed.


manipulated/victim/boltons:I think sansa has spent most of the show as a victim, either trapped in kings landing or trapped with the boltons and having a bunch of bad stuff happen to her over and over. There isn't a lot of forward momentum in her storyline until very recently and it gets boring watching nothing the same thing happen over and over again to a character, especially when the same thing is unpleasant. it doesn't have to do with what the character could do differently, it has more to do with the storyline that the writers put her in. a lot of fans had the same problem with daenarys doing the same thing over and over in slavers bay and the storyline feeling slow. its more frustrating when the character, who is one of the good guys, just keeps losing over and over again and is never able to do anything, especially when the she got out of kings landing but then agreed to go back into a similar situation.


yeah those are fair criticisms of jon, and i think fans have talked about that - especially him not listening to Sansa about ramseys psychological warfare.  but that doesn't change salsa's actions and she has done more annoying things with bigger consequences and her storyline has not been as satisfying so far.



I am not saying anything should be changed in the story, i think Sansa is a good character, just most of the time the character is making mistakes and the reader/watcher wants the good guys to win. Just like everyone hated joffery, but also thought the character was well written. Sansa is naive and idealistic and keeps losing and getting hurt because of that. 

The only thing that doesn't really make sense to me is that she would go marry ramsey. that is different from the book so it could be explained by the show runners trying to hit a plot point from the book without adding another character that would just confuse things and take up more time. a related complaint people have about her arc is that she goes through hell at kings landing, gets out and the character appears to be moving forward, and then she seems to backtrack to a vulnerable position again. her arc in the book will probably be different and more satisfying because she doesn't marry ramsey in the book. I understand that the show runners can't put everything from the books in the show but i think they could have found a better way to cover the bolton plot line without undermining salsa's character arc.

Doran had a decades long pact to marry his daughter (yes, he had a daughter in the books and another son), to Viserys in exchange for supporting his return and making her Queen. Sure, that ended in season 1 - but he wasn't done. 

When he heard of Dany in Mereen, he sent his elder son to court her and marry her - though she went missing soon after he got there. This was the guy who thought that maybe he could control the chained dragons and tried to smuggle them out - only to set them free and get roasted for his efforts. 

Instead of trying to kill Myrcella, Doran's daughter and the Sand Snakes tried to crown her Queen as a move against Cersei. Doran decisively put a stop to that and confided his real plans in his daughter. 

Meanwhile, another Targaryen has already landed on Westeros with a large army - Aegon, Rhaegar's elder son who was saved by Varys when Tywin attacked and who had been raised in secret all this time (or so he says).

I can't remember a time where she joked or smiled at something that wasn't about killing a bunch of people. Jon of course is the king of brooding, but we've seen him be happy. Ygritte's death still gets to me because he was so close to staying in that cave with her. I don't think Daenyres has had anything like that aside from Drogo, which I still never really felt their relationship the way I did with Jon and Ygritte, and back then I liked her. 

Yes of course people act differently with different people, I should've been more clear. The way it appeared to me is that she was this super stern ""do what I say or you are against me"" thing, and then did like a 180 and said yeah it's cool take the dragonglass. It is important for someone to listen to their council as she did with Tyrion, but I feel like that happens a lot. She only realizes her error when it's pointed out to her, and rarely questions her choices. Jon questions everything he does, can both listen to his advisors and ignore them, crafting his own decisions all of the time.

I see this counterargument brought up, against the theory I presented, quite often. I'm glad you bring it up.

Because I would challenge the notion that them turning Craster's babies into WW is inherently contradictory to them wanting to become human again/die. Why? Because they are also *practical beings*. They're intelligent. They organize. The reason they are turning babies into wights/walkers, is because they need stock to their armies. The destruction of Westeros, as well as dying in peace, is just a long term end goal for them. In order to get there, they need to strengthen their position as much as possible, even if it means doing unto others what was done unto them.

all the female examples you've listed are women who play traditionally masculine roles, can't you see it? Arya, Meera, Brienne, Lyanna, they're all a bunch of tomboys, aren't they? And apart from Arya and say, Brienne, they're all way too minor to even make an impact on the viewership.

Basically the only leading female characters on the show are Sansa, Daenerys, Arya and Cersei. Arya is 100% a warrior semi-psychopath tomboy who just murders people at will, Cersei is Tywin 2.0, crazy af and murders people at will. The writers have gone to great lengths to tells us just how masculine they are, and how much they don't like ""girls"" (remember Arya disguising as a boy or saying shit like ""girls are stupid"", or Cersei blathering on and on about being Tywin's true son or whatever?)

Sansa and Daenerys instead are both very feminine characters (which doesn't mean weak) who have feminine concerns, act feminine and generally follow a ""feminine moral compass"": Daenerys is a Mother (of Dragons, of slaves, etc.), Sansa is the archetypal young Lady who wants to protect her family. Edit for clarification: I don't think people hate feminine characters *because* they're feminine, what I think is that characters who embody generally feminine traits just get given *a lot* less leeway than masculine female characters or men (e.g. all the actual murderers and psychopaths who get a big cheer every time they appear on screen) and get criticised a lot more and a lot louder for whatever opinion they express.

Like cersi said, there is food in high garden. Also while surrounded by enemies none of them are going on the offensive soon. So they will attack high garden for supplies. Then possibly deal with dorne somehow. Then there will be 4 major sides. Danny, lanisters, the north, and the walkers.   
The north is too preoccupied with the walkers to do anything against cersi so really the lanisters only have to fight danny and if they do so after defeating high garden and dorne then it should be a decent fight considering they will be well supplied and rich off loot.   
I have full confidence that the lanisters will attack high garden and win. It would be bad story telling for the lanister army to be defeated by attrition and lack of morale. Considering cersi and Jamie both mention needing a victory to boost morale and allies, and also supplies that high garden has. It just seems like a certainty.   
Danny didnt bring 3 dragons, the unsullied, and a horde all the way across the ocean to defeat a shadow of what the lanisters army used to be. No. They will become stronger than ever and itll be a big battle.

29573,"To me its fairly applying the ""rules"" to everyone. Euron is highly competent and skilled but the same is applied to a lot of the characters in the story. Brienne hasn't lost a fight yet. Jon has killed everyone he's gone up against, etc. etc.

So to say that Euron shows up and it's just a forced bad guy, well, to me that's just ignoring the whole host of forced good guys who also don't get killed. Part of that is just storytelling. At the end of the day Daenerys Targaryen isn't going to be killed by some Son of the Harpy with a lucky spear throw. 

It's applying these made up ""rules"" to a bad guy rather than a good guy which is at least fairer than simply having all the good guys have plot armor. In this, the good guys have plot armor but the bad guys do too.

I would at least say Euron is far better than Ramsay in this regard given that we've got plenty of backstory for *why* Euron is good at what he does. He's the master of the seas, a famous ship captain with a decade-plus of experience, probably the best sailor in the world. He's very well established as ""good at ships,"" so it's not a surprise that in a ship battle, he did well.

The only thing that bothered me about Ramsay, was that there was no real reason for him to be hyper-competent at war. He was a young lord, sure he would have some martial training, but where would he have infiltrated an enemy's camp with 20 men and set fire to everything? Who taught him to fight with no armor on, etc?He didn't have nearly the experience that Euron had.",gameofthrones

Maybe, but Jon is understandably not concerned with uniting the kingdoms against the WWs at this very moment.  His focus is on the imminent arrival of the WW army at the Wall and how to defend/survive against it.  Jon certainly does not need advice from Sansa about how to unite the North and prepare the defenses.

Sansa advice in this first episode was really shortsighted and rudely given, in my opinion.  When it comes to King's Landing and Cersei she probably does have some valuable insight to give but the way she forced it on him now and tut-tut'd him (publicly, no less) works against her.  It is pretty clear to me that the writers are intentionally creating a small but widening riff between Jon and Sansa for Littlefinger to exploit somehow.  That's fine, but I wish they had come up with a way for Sansa grievances to be more plausible rather than the departure from logic and embrace of irrational emotion that they are.",gameofthrones

The face of the man who killed his brother, Willem, was crystal clear in his memory though. Yoren's desire for revenge consumed him so much that it blotted out what should have been a cherished memory of his family.

That story foreshadows Arya's own descent into vengeance. Right now, if she wanted to, she could be with her own kin, people who love her and miss her. Instead her pursuit of vengeance has overridden her familial bonds.

&gt;Do any of you think she actually will kill cercei?

31054,"This is connected to the Great Empire of Dawn theories. These proto-Valyrians roamed the Planetos on dragonbacks and got destroyed during the Long Night. The Seastone Chair is described as oily black that is found in a lot of sinister places (Asshai, Yeen etc.). If you have read ""The Forsaken"" sample chapter from TWOW then it is expected that Euron is planning some huge blood offering at the base of Hightower (also a black stone) and give rise to the Great Other.

Also, the legend of Long Night in Yi-Ti mentions the Bloodstone Emperor killed his sister and startee worshipping a black stone that fell from the sky. Euron seems to parallel this.",gameofthrones

34128,"You are looking at it from a Lannister perspective. The Lannister way of playing the game is to get one over everybody, to bend them to your will and walk all over them proving themselves to be the top dog. This gets you results, sure, but it also ends up making you a lot of enemies. This fits with their sigil of being a lion - something that goes around conquering and crushing everyone. 


The Tyrell style isn't to make great moves, its to make a lot of small and subtle moves by expanding their influence. Like a rose (or more accurately, weeds) you won't see them making sudden power grabs. But their power would still keep increasing and before you know it, the place is covered in them.


Their ""great play"" was already done with their introduction when they managed to make Margaery Queen. They managed to put their people on the small council and they made alliances in other places without making enemies. They tried to get North on their side through Sansa, which almost worked. And Margaery was working on the High Septon by making sure that she and Loras got to go free after Cersei's trial was over. 


Their ""weakness"" would be that they expect others to act rationally as they do. Crossing certain line would end up destroying them as well as their enemies - so they assume their enemies would be smart enough not to go their.

Sansa seems to be on point with the logistics, so I see her staying on that. Keeping everyone united and keeping home base secured, letting Jon to set up the battle plans.

So its Bran the informant, Sansa the logistics, Jon the fighter, and Arya the stealth assassinator.

Or do you think Rhaegar just yelled at her and got salty for her asking that question lol. Also if I recall from the books Rhaegar was sick and tired of Aerys's shit too, and didn't agree with the incest, so why would he want that for his kid? TPTWP didn't say anything about incest, other than that he would come from Aerys and his sister's line.

And if the Knights were there, they'd all be dead because of it. Them surprising Ramsay's people when they thought they'd had Jon and Co. cornered is the **ONLY** reason that the Knights of the Vale swooping in worked. Otherwise they'd have broken from formation to help him too and also ended up cornered.

I agree 100% with Jon about not taking the castles away. Sansa isn't perfect. But the OTT demonization of her and refusal to give her credit for anything gets tedious. As does this ""Jon can do no wrong"" narrative. He underestimated Ramsay, he's underestimating Cersei. And Sansa's not wrong to call him on it. He has been routinely dismissive of all the advice she offers",gameofthrones
38638,"I feel like a lot of people overlook how smart Sansa actually is, honestly. It's easy to write her off as a whiny, stupid little girl who had nothing but fantasy and dreams in her head. She started showing her ability to manipulate and play her situation to her advantage back in season 2. She tiptoed around Joffrey, feigned her loyalty to him to Cersei and everyone else in KL because she knew she couldn't trust any of them and she had to play her cards right. I especially now look back on and love her treatment of Joffrey: goading him to go ""where the fighting is thickest"" to get himself killed in Blackwater, saving the Fool's life by appeasing to Joffrey's sadism, etc. 

Despite how much she's come to despise Littlefinger, her behavior in BotB makes a lot of sense. Yes, she was trying to outwit Ramsey, and yes she beat him at his own game. However, we have to keep in mind that she probably wasn't even positive that Littlefinger would come through with the Vale. She'd just rejected him and basically told him to GTFO. He could've just easily written her off as well, so she likely didn't tell Jon just in case he became hopeful for reinforcements that might not come. Add that to the fact that if Ramsey saw their army was bigger than his, he'd have bolted for Winterfell like the coward he was and waited them out. 

A lot of people seem to have a misconception about her motives during that episode. She wasn't needlessly trying to sacrifice men for no reason. People were bound to die, anyway. It's war. And if the Starks didn't reclaim Winterfell, then the War for the Dawn would be barely possible especially since I believe Winterfell is going to be the base of operations in a way. ",gameofthrones

There were still lots of cool spots in Season 5 - the ruins of Valyria and the stone men were pretty cool to see brought to life, because that was a good part in ADWD. I hated that they killed Barristan though, especially since he's still alive in the books and being a badass.

He did his job just as well if not better than Tywin did and his primary political enemies were his nephew and his sister, who he could not tear down like the rest because they are his primary family.

39096,"&gt;Sure she manipulated the Vale lords but there's no indication she was doing the same to Littlefinger.

She did by publicly declaring him as her guardian. Now LF was kind of bound to protect her - he found a way around that, though. 

&gt;Jon's strategy never would have worked on Ramsay anyway, he's too smart for that. It would have proceeded differently as I already told you, the Vale could bypass Jon and go straight for the remainder of the Bolton army. Infantry don't typically do well when they are outnumbered by heavy cavalry, they would be completely enveloped as they were out in the open without any form of terrain advantage.

Then the number of Wildling casualties would've been the same. And the Vale men can't bypass Jon - take a look at the battlefield. 

&gt;What about the people who live on the Umber and Karstark lands?

Keep the 2 lords as hostages to ensure their loyalty. That's the best way to achieve unity. The loyalty of these kids isn't certain - they might appreciate Jon's mercy or they might resent him for killing their fathers. Its a gamble right now - but holding them hostage will keep their men in line. 

&gt;By ""resolving"" the issue Sansa's way you open up the chance for more infighting.

Not if Jon is smart about it. 

&gt;Under normal circumstances sure the Umbers and Karstarks could have been punished more harshly but the long term effects are irrelevant if the Night King isn't stopped.

You have it backwards. Jon's decision is better for the long-term stability. His decision is what is done under normal circumstances. But like I said, Sansa's suggestion opens up too many political opportunities for someone in crisis and that's why Jon should've taken it. 

&gt;As for the threat of Cersei she would have to be a complete and utter idiot to attempt to invade the North during winter.

That she is. Or more specifically, she'd be too arrogant to consider the downside of what she'd think of as a brilliant plan. 

Her most dangerous option would be try and follow Tywin's example - send a small force of 500-1000 men via the coast. Instruct them to burn the villages and the granaries. Hope that either Jon rides out with a small force to deal with them or he marshalls his forces, taking men away from Moat Cailin which would give her an opportunity to invade. 

Jon wouldn't actually have to do much here - Winter will kill these men pretty soon. But they'll burn enough villages and destroy enough granaries for that to become a problem in the bigger war. ",gameofthrones

what a plot hole truly is, is an event in the plot that defies the logic laid down previously in the plot, or violates the laws of logic and physics that determine the universe in which the story takes place.

for instance people claim that Batman putting up a flaming bat signal on the bridge in TDKR is a plot hole for the simple fact that it takes too much time away from him fighting Bane to reclaim the city.... but that's not a plot hole.  waste of time? yes.

No.  But.... it does not defy any laws of logic or physics...  there was nothing in the universe, or in the story, that already happened that should have prevented him from doing it........

now, a very small minor plothole can be seen in the Shawshank Redemption when the poster that hides the escape route it secured tightly on all 4 corners after Andy escapes.... that's not physically possible as Andy would be in the tunnel while reattaching it, and would be able to attach 3 corners, but not all 4.


So, yes, Edmure's fate would be a loose thread....


As for the people of Riverrun who ""currently don't have a Lord anymore""....  what people are these?  The soldiers that control Riverrun?  Nope, they're Lannisters.  If they're Freys, that's different.  If you mean the army of House Tully.... well their fate is unknown as they surrendered to Jaime on Edmure's orders.  If you mean the residents who live in the River Lands....... well, are we sure that Edmure can unite the River Lands the same way that Jon united the North (assuming we're talking strictly about the TV show)?",gameofthrones

Silica: Silicon Dioxide*. Obsidian is glass made of silica and oxygen, and other heavier metals found in 'mafic' (magnesium/ferric [iron containing]) rocks, such as basalt.  The volcanic glass is cooled very quickly, which mean no time for crystal formation at all, even the basalt spewed out of volcano cools ""slowly"" enough that small crystals form.  The crystals serve to muddy the glassy appearance, and also bind the rock together more thoroughly, which is why lava flow (aa) rocks are sharp, but hard, and sound glassy when broken.  Volcanic glass, much like manufactured glass, is easily broken and simultaneously can have extremely sharp edges.

it sort of depends on your definition of ""novel."" if you're considering the potentially 7-book-long cycle as one unit, then of course it seems unfinished until the last one is complete. but if you view them as individual novels with their own arcs, then the fact that a sequel has been promised is just that... a fact, something to look forward to and perhaps rue if it somehow doesn't come to pass, but why should that change anything about the present? 

The new national obsession with completionism and instant gratification is unhealthy and kind of strange. writing and publishing a novel is a job, and completing that is worth some money if people are willing to pay it. there can be subjective assessments of how well that novel stands on its own, but acting like the promise of future installments makes anything less than 100% of the promise meaningless is silly.

Basically, if you enjoyed the first book, or the first five books, then nobody but you can take that enjoyment away.  and reading the book in the first place was certainly your choice, presumably done with the full knowledge that it was part of a proposed cycle. if you consider that to be ""taking a risk,"" then it's entirely your responsibility.

I think littlefinger is trying to revive that old character in her, and she can be manipulated due to all the stress she's endured with Ramsay, etc. as a reminder, her hair is now styled like Cersei's was when she had long hair.

45272,"I love the flagrant spam tag, this is way too clever to remove",gameofthrones
45278,"Assuming that the two events happened in the same time period (episodes can cover events over many months) the Lannister/Greyjoy fleet would not have the strength to attack Dany's fleet and therefore wouldn't attempt to when they have a city and a defendable port to hole up in. One has to to put the strength of the two fleets in perspective to truly get a grip on the strategies employed by both sides. 

1) The Iron fleet numbers one hundred ships according to the wiki, weather this is with or without bannermen is unknown so for the sake of this speculation I'll assume it's with because many ironborn are sailing with Dany. One hundred ships is a huge armada (The Spanish armada consisted 130 ships) and if we're going of the base that the average historical combat longship has 20-30 rowing benches each sitting four people we could say that the iron fleet is 8,000-12,000 sailors strong. These sailors are some of the best marines and boarding specialists in the world and are experts in naval warfare.

2) Dany's fleet is large enough to transport roughly 100,000 dothraki and their horses, as well as 8,000 unsullied, and I'll estimate 5,000 ironborn. They obviously aren't using the same ships but to put it in perspective thats about 942 of the largest historical longships without the horses in the equation. Plus dragons and the Dornish fleet that will probably link up with Dany.

So the idea of the lannister/greyjoy fleet attempting to engage Dany's fleet is insane. Aegon conquered Westeros with around 1,600 men and three dragons. Ships are wooden; dragons breathe fire. The greyjoy fleet will get smacked by Dany. Even if Dany had no dragons she would win the naval battle. She would take enormous casualties due to the greyjoys being naval experts and it might be enough to make her lose the war farther down the road, but she would still make landing at dragonstone with a sizable army. The cost far outweighs the reward because Cersei needs all the troops she can get to hold against the rest of the seven kingdoms. The greyjoy attack would be an effective suicide charge without the dragons. With the dragons it would be similar to the charge of the light brigade. Extreme cost for no payoff.",gameofthrones

It could be possible for Euron to be sailing south 50-100 miles offshore in a storm to catch up to Yara and Yara staying within 10-20 miles of land in less wind and better conditions.  

If we consider that the weather in the stormlands is similar to that of the equator on earth (I'm not to versed in westeros geography) it would be common to have short thunderstorms with wind and calm areas in between.

&gt; With the end of Game of Thrones in sight, showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have set their sights on their next TV project.
&gt; 
&gt; The award-winning duo will reteam with HBO for the drama series Confederate, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.
&gt; 
&gt; The drama chronicles the events leading to the Third American Civil War. The series takes place in an alternate timeline, where the Southern states have successfully seceded from the Union, giving rise to a nation in which slavery remains legal and has evolved into a modern institution. The story follows a broad swath of characters on both sides of the Mason-Dixon Demilitarized Zone — freedom fighters, slave hunters, politicians, abolitionists, journalists, the executives of a slave-holding conglomerate and the families of people in their thrall.
&gt; 
&gt; Benioff and Weiss will write the project and serve as showrunners. Nichelle Tramble Spellman (Justified, The Good Wife) and Malcolm Spellman (Empire) are also attached as writers. The four will executive produce with Carolyn Strauss (Game of Thrones) and Bernadette Caulfield (Game of Thrones, Big Love). Production on Confederate will begin after the eighth and final season of Game of Thrones, which is expected to air in either 2018 or 2019.
&gt; 
&gt; ""As the brilliant Game of Thrones winds down to its final season, we are thrilled to be able to continue our relationship with Dan and David, knowing that any subject they take on will result in a unique and ambitious series,"" HBO president of original programming Casey Bloys said Wednesday in a statement. ""Their intelligent, wry and visually stunning approach to storytelling has a way of engaging an audience and taking them on an unforgettable journey. Confederate promises to be no exception, and we are honored to be adding the talented team of Nichelle and Malcolm Spellman to the mix.""
&gt; 
&gt; Confederate joins original dramas Westworld, which just nabbed 22 Emmy nominations, as well as the forthcoming David Simon period drama The Deuce, which is set to premiere in September. While the pay cabler has expanded its comedy offerings with recent entries like Insecure and Divorce, its drama offerings have dwindled in recent years with the recent third and final season of The Leftovers and the upcoming end of Game of Thrones, by far the channel's most-watched series ever.
&gt; 
&gt; HBO's other upcoming series include Succession from Adam McKay (The Big Short), Today Will Be Different starring Julia Roberts, the Amy Adams-led Sharp Objects and family drama Here, Now from former True Blood and Six Feet Under boss Alan Ball. As with Ball and The Wire's Simon, HBO has worked repeatedly with several of its most acclaimed creators, making a second collaboration with Benioff and Weiss all the more logical.
&gt; 
&gt; In anticipation of Game of Thrones' upcoming final season — the seven-episode seventh season launched on Sunday — HBO is already hard at work on four (potentially five) possible successor shows, with different writers attached to each project. Benioff and Weiss, however, will not have a role in any future Game of Thrones projects, opting instead to focus on ending the original series and now, seemingly, Confederate.
&gt; 
&gt; For Benioff and Weiss, Confederate would mark only their second TV series, the first being Game of Thrones. The Troy scribe and Lucky Wander Boy author, respectively, found enormous success with the adaptation of George R.R. Martin's beloved book series. They have each won four Emmys, including two for best drama series for Game of Thrones.
&gt; 
&gt; ""We have discussed Confederate for years, originally as a concept for a feature film,"" said Benioff and Weiss. ""But our experience on Thrones has convinced us that no one provides a bigger, better storytelling canvas than HBO. There won't be dragons or White Walkers in this series, but we are creating a world, and we couldn't imagine better partners in world-building than Nichelle and Malcolm, who have impressed us for a long time with their wit, their imagination and their Scrabble-playing skills.""

We don't know that Jon is not a legitimate son of Rhaegar and Lyanna.  There are two books yet to be written, and there are plenty of theories out there that, because the Targaryens often took more than one wife, Rhaegar very likely married Lyanna - the daughter of Ned Stark who, in my own humble opinion, wouldn't bring dishonor to her family by having a child out of wedlock.  It is beyond a stretch of the imagination to believe Lyanna would consent to have sex without the benefit of marriage.  The strong reality is that Jon is NOT a bastard son of Rhaegar, but a legitimate son of his and Lyanna's and, therefore, the TRUE heir to the Iron Throne.

That did not  do good for anyone as it caused the Dance of dragons between two potential heirs. 

So if Tywin marries again, who's to say the offspring from his new wife won't try to push over Jaime and Tyrion's claim for Casterly Rock? If Jaime is made to quit the kingsguard, he would end up being threatened by the new heirs.

Cersei was queen mother and a queen mother can potentially rule as queen regent on behalf of her children until the heir comes of age, but the queen mother herself has no claim whatsoever.

A villain is a bad person who does bad things. 

An antagonist is a person who opposes the protagonist. 

Since Cersei is technically the protagonist in King's Landing during Seasons 5 and 6, since we're mainly following her story, she's classified as a villainous protagonist due to her wicked actions and personality.

The High Sparrow is thus the antagonist, since he's opposing Cersei. However, his interests are of the people, of the greater good. What he's doing is good by purging corruption and making things as the gods will it (which is seen as very good in Westeros). Thus, the High Sparrow is the heroic antagonist to Cersei.

When he was killed she could very easily have gone to live with the rest of the wives but she stepped into the flames and eventually ended up heading her own khalasar. I could go on. I personally think she has managed to do a lot especially given her alienation from most of Westeros and her inexperience. The fact that she made it home the way she did is incredible.

Sansa to Jon: I'm not positive LF will come through with the Vale and I don't want you to get your hopes up for reinforcements that might not come....but you have lots of horsemen and they have to be coming from the south, why don't you send out a bunch of riders to be sure?

Your second point assumes that Jon, Davos and Tormund have all been lobotimized simultaneously. Why would they just give up the element of surprise?

So now you're back to the beginning and need to question her motives. (At this point Sansa fans try another tact - that she has developed preternatural powers about the future in addition to becoming the incarnation of Irwin Rommel).

Also, in the episodes prior to this, it is clear she was offering opinions on strategy and being listened to, if not always getting her way.

Then she questions his orders, publicly, and refuses to let it go after he explains himself the first time. Contrast that with another fan favorite, Danaerys. In season 3 her advisors (Jorah and Barristan) question her in front of Master Kraznys. She (rightly, imho) tells them after that that while she values their opinion, if they ever question her in front of strangers again they'll be advising someone else. 

Why is this accepted coming from Danaerys but not from Jon?",gameofthrones
50216,"Nowhere did I say it might not be more visceral for people, that's certainly understandable. But notice my list also pointed out the many times the show had used rape in the past. Including in the first episode, where a rape occurs in a very similar circumstance (the new bride raped by her husband). That episode, is, for instance, ranked very highly on this same list. As are other episodes where characters are raped. Those same viewers would feel that same discomfort.

Something making you uncomfortable or causing a visceral reaction doesn't make it bad or a misstep. To me, the entire conceit of Game of Thrones is that it goes for those visceral reactions, George R.R. Martin has said for instance that his series is a response to Tolkien, where the evils in the world are by and large inhuman monsters - orcs - who, as you say, nobody has to worry about coming to attack them at night. In Game of Thrones, by contrast, the horrors are by and large committed by real people and they commit the horrors in the way real people commit them. Rape, murder, betrayal, these are all things people recognize from the real world, and so the evils in Game of Thrones hit closer to home than high-fantasy escapism. The discomfort *is the point*. That may not be everyone's cup of tea, but my point is that 5 seasons into the show, there were more than enough depictions of things that should make you uncomfortable - even if we just limited to rape - that I don't get why the reaction to that scene in particular was so drastically different than all the others.

So this is the point where you will undoubtedly make the point that it's not the rape, it's essentially an argument about shot selection and Theon being featured last, which we discussed yesterday. If that's the case, it's more of a technical or cinematic criticism than a moral one. First of all, recognize that while that might be *your* criticism, for other people *it's just about the rape*, which I still don't get for the reasons above (see, for example, the person I was responding to, who states it gives him/her a primal disgust, it's an emotional, non rational response that they just don't want to see it). Like I said, I understand the response - I understand it less in the context of a show that has served that up for five seasons, but I understand that people will react that way. Fine, but it doesn't make it a misstep.

For the people in your camp, who say it was more about the fact that the last shot somehow makes it Theon's moment or makes Theon into more of the victim, that's fine too. That's not how I read the scene nor do I think it was the intent, but that's fine. But these people are ultimately taking a minor point about how they should have structured the scene cinematically and then girding themselves in the armor of moral outrage. Yeah you may not have liked that shot selection, but to then describe it as a ""disgusting choice"" as you did yesterday brings us right back to the fact that you just plain old don't like seeing rape more than anything else. It's essentially a [motte-and-bailey argument,](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Motte_and_bailey) you begin by saying the scene was disgusting, someone responds and says ""OK, so we shouldn't show rape then?,"" you retreat to ""it's not the act of rape, it's the way they ordered the shots!,"" people reasonably disagree on how the scene reads, and then you go right back to claiming the moral high ground and calling on people to stop watching the show. It's a blending of the two positions. I might not like how a director framed a scene, the shots they chose to use, but that's not the kind of disagreement or criticism that then leads to this being ""the worst episode in the history of the show"" or a ""disgusting choice."" So, to me, ultimately all the arguments about *how* it was carried out, ring rather hollow because I think this is much more about the way people react to something they don't want to see. It's sort of like Gamergaters claiming their crusade is about ""ethics in gaming journalism"" - it's a minor issue that doesn't line up with the type of rhetoric and outrage that people are offering up.",gameofthrones

I'll reiterate. Nothing but creative writing or using her dragons on King's Landing has her win this war. Episode 3 was fantastic because they stuck to a character's nature. Jaime, the good tactician. Tyrion, the guy who thinks he's smarter than he really is. They also employed basic tactics. If they keep this type of writing up, the war is over.

50665,"&gt;You know, we have always assumed both Jon and Dany would be ""Good Guys"" on the same side. It's entirely possible that Dany ends up a villain still, though. It would be an incredible twist, but an entirely possible one nonetheless. It would be easy to do, too: have Dany lose a few battles, and decide to torch King's Landing with her dragons as the only way to get the throne.

888

&gt;I think it's almost inevitable at this point. Her visions in season 2 had her at a barren, snow covered iron throne, there's been multiple glimpses of a dragon flying over king's landing, multiple references to 'ruling the ashes'. There's no way to reconcile the fact that the Dothraki only value strength through rape and pillage.
At the very least we're going to come to a point where Dany realizes she can't have her cake and eat it too. Whatever she does from that point will dictate how the series ends.

I think it's far more likely Cersei sets off the rest of the Wildfire, leaving nothing left for Dany to rule, hence her vision and in it her walking away from the throne to join the fight at the wall. ",gameofthrones

His belated agreeement of Jon's challenging him to single combat wasn't necessarily just mockery on Ramsay's part, but he might have felt that he could achieve a moral victory of sorts if he were to fight Jon one-on-one, even though he would almost certainly lose that match-up.

Ramsay's final conversation with Sansa suggests that the prospect of fame was something he concerned himself with. He's effectively resigned  to the likelihood that he was probably never going to leave that cell alive, but taunts Sansa by insisting that he is a 'part of [her] now' that even in victory she will never truly be able to forget. Sansa counters with a taunt of her own, telling Ramsay that both she and history will forget him.

Finishing a giant shortly before dueling Jon was about as impressive a legacy as he could hope for at that point. I'm sure he also knew that even if he did kill Jon, it would make little if any difference. His army was completely decimated, and Sansa was well-positioned to assume Jon's leadership role had he been killed that day.

Of all the Starks, Arya is the most social and connected to the people. Her journey at the moment is not at its completion, she is gradually opening her heart again after all the tragedy she has faced since losing her father. Once at Winterfell, there is a lot of healing she can do there. 

And to go back to your earlier point, what purpose will she have in Winterfell? Protecting her House, rebuilding her home and keeping her pack together... even more so in the books, her future is hinted at more clearly and it won't be something she has ever wanted. Just like Jon never expected to be anything more than a Bastard, or Bran wanting nothing more than to become a Knight. George denies the Stark what they wanted and chooses to challenge them instead. These endgames are not going to be predictable at all. I think it's safer to not think ""What would Arya want?"" when predicting her future. ",gameofthrones

How to wrap a ""divine miracle"" around his survival is eluding me right now. We need to establish the drowned god somehow visually in a TV show. We probably have no priest to explain it, no other actors to play off of and only Theons actions to work with. That is not a lot to work with unless we go into visions/dream territory that GoT completely reserved for Bran.

Maybe just show him drowning in the black ocean or even hit the ocean floor softly then cut away. Then later wash him up on a beach, apparently dead, suddenly choking back to life. 

Then either let him act erratic/ extremely determined or surround him with heaps of visual symbols, cues and omens that this is the working of the drowned god.

Just because it didn't happen to you doesn't mean that the people who it happened to are wrong, it just means you have different thresholds for suspension of disbelief. If Ed Sheeran also had a giant green mohawk, as a silly example, then maybe you might be able to see yourself losing immersion.

The biggest issue with Ed himself was that he didn't have a character. If Ed was the dude who talked about his wife and kid or the dude who made the wine, I'd be much less pulled out of the world than I was. The other (bigger) issue was that along with Ed pulling me out of the world, the scene itself did too. 

Throughout the *entire goddamn series* we've been shown that the world is fucking *merciless*. It's a horrible place to live, and even in the same episode we see the peasants who Sandor stole from have perished. Hell, we've seen multiple scenes where soldiers just straight up raped and killed girls because they could.

And yet here we have a band of happy-go-lucky young men who drink wine and hunt and eat their catches, sing their merry songs, greet and host travellers, have children, love life, far removed from the people they're fighting for. 

I get it, it was trying to remind us that ""soldiers are people too"", but it was so ham-fisted that compounded with Ed Sheeran it shattered my suspension of disbelief. There were so many other ways to show a lighter side to the world, but they just shoved it in with a shoved in cameo. I mean ""Are you old enough to drink""!? Like come on, this shit is not good writing.

I want to clarify: Ed Sheeran did *nothing* wrong and anyone who says anything bad about him are fucking idiots. I actually thought his song was really well done, and I would've loved if he was actually a bloody character. My issue is with the creators of the show making the scene immersion-breaking by making some shoddy mistakes.

It's the same reasons people are frustrated at the weirdness surrounding Dany's army and Euron's army. It doesn't make sense with respect to the world we've been shown (although some of the explanations are quite good).

As a side: Compare the scene to Jim Broadbent's scene. Jim took me out for a second (as all new, famous actors in the show do) but he developed his character within a few lines.

In the show, the sex comes isn't used to advance the characters/stories, but as a way to smooth out the clunky exposition that the writers wedged in. Especially in the particularly clunky scenes like Littlefinger and Varys/Doreah. It's not integral to the plot, it's a distraction FROM the plot.

On the other, the people in the north mostly value honour and respect and sparing these two kids might only be able to be repaid with absolute loyalty in the eyes of these kids. I think there is no right or wrong in this scenario. 

These kids that Jon spared might end up crossing him again. After all, he is the illegitimate son of a traitor of the crown, who brought an army of savages, known for raping, cannibalism and pillaging into the homeland of the people he is supposed to protect and all that because of a seemingly fairy-tale threat that most people don't really believe in, making him look like a lunatic.

But if Jon kills them too, he will probably squash the last remnants of some ancient houses in the north, meaning there are two life long allies of the Starks that were repaid for thousand years of loyalty and one moment of weakness, in which they only hoped for the best outcome of their own people, with the absolute oblitaration of their ruling family.

1) Why would Lyanna tell Ned that Robert would kill the baby if he found out about him if the child was his? He'd be ecstatic to know he and Lyanna, his one true love, have a child together.

2) This is the biggest one, there is no way Robert and Lyanna had sex 9 months before the birth. Robert's Rebellion lasted close to a year, the kidnapping of Lyanna by Rhaegar happened *before* the rebellion even started. The rebellion started after Lyanna was kidnapped, Ned Stark's father and brother rode to King's Landing to demand her back, and Arys demanded Ned Stark &amp; Robert's heads from John Arryn. There's just no way Robert snuck off to impregnate Lyanna, left her with the man he thought was raping her and then went back to the rebellion.

Now, you can argue that someone else might be Jon's father, but as far as the show as concerned, we know it's Rhaegar Targaryan, because HBO put out an [infographic](http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/got-connections-ned-promise-tower-of-joy-infographic) with Jon Snow's family tree and it lists Rhaegar as the father.

66975,"Depends on what ships they got from Dorne and from Highgarden. I'd assume a larger warship with possible multiple decks you could potentially fit that many horses on a ship. I'm pretty sure that when Varys showed up in Dorne, part of what we didn't see was explaining to them specifically what Dany needed. He had the measure of the ships that were already available to her, and I'm sure at some point his little birds told him about Theon and Yara popping up and joining forces too. The biggest roadblock for Dany at that point was having ships that could accommodate horses. I think between Highgarden and Dorne, Highgarden had the trees that could be felled to make the larger ships to carry horses.

Of course when I rewatched the last scene of Season 6, episode 10 it looks like they just accommodated the horses by doing a slight modification in the holds of a standard ship. Looks like the holds are basically open, with some cross beams going across the opening so you can sort of balance across and walk from one side of the deck to the other instead of going around the open holds. I was thinking they'd pack them into a larger ship like the Spanish did when they'd transport ponies and horses over to the Americas (and probably what they were thinking with their calculations) but the Dothraki revere and respect their horses much more than the Conquistadors did so of course, they'd not pack them in really tight and also give them access to fresh air. Looks like maybe 8 to 10 horses per ship, per the final scene.",gameofthrones

While the Conclave does choose the Seneschal, they do so by drawing lots. However, the current Seneschal, Archmaester Theobald, volunteered after the senile Archmaester Walgrave was chosen.

Part of the reason Pycelle has been Grand Maester for so long is that about half a dozen Grand Maesters died in as many years immediately before his appointment, the last dying of a cold before reaching King's Landing. The Conclave then chose an unusually young Pycelle to try to prevent another quick appointment.

&gt;Pate

68689,"Copy and pasted from my theory post

I know others believe this but idk if they have presented this evidence.

I think his name is Aemon and here is why, besides slowing down Lyannas whisper scene and watching it repeatdly.

First off the popular Jaehaerys theory is based off the name of Jon Snows great grand father Jaehaerys II (from the novels) and he was a good king and he was named after the greatest king, the original Jaehaerys I. Well in the tv show Jaeharys II does not exist they cut his whole generation out.

In the books its like this Maekar&gt;Aegon&gt;Jaehaerys&gt;Aerys&gt;Rhaegar&gt;Jon In show it is like this Maekar&gt;Aegon&gt;Aerys&gt;Rhaegar&gt;Jon

So you see an entire generation has been omitted in the TV series a generation which was in part the foundation of the Jaehaerys theory. Maestor Aemon is the brother of both of the Aegons book and TV series. Being Jons Great Great Great Uncle in the Books and Jons Great Great Uncle in the TV show.

So if Jons name was Aemon he would bear the same name as his great great uncle Maester Aemon who in turn was named after his great great uncle Aemon the Dragonknight. Aemon the Dragonknight also had a brother named Aegon who was also king. ""Prince Aemon the Dragonknight has been referred to as the noblest knight who ever lived, and his skill with a sword is legendary throughout Westeros."" Noble and awesome swordsman sounds like our Jon.

The Dragonknight was also a LORD COMMANDER but of the kings guard instead of the Nights Watch. So Jon was a Lord Commander of the Night's Watch which gives him a trait of both of the previous Aemons. Since one was a Lord Commander and the other was a member of the Nights Watch.

Maester Aemon was also the one who believed in The Prince that was Promised prophecy he believed Jons father Rhaegar was TPTWP. Rhaegar later believed that it was probably his son Aegon but he died too.

So if Jon was named Aemon, him and his brothed Aegon would be third set of Aegon Aemon brothers with Aemon being king instead of Aegon.

So if Bran told Jon ""Your Aemon Targaryan"" it would be the same thing Jon told Maester Aemon when he found out his identitiy.

Also to consider, Rhaegar and his Great Uncle Maestor Aemon wrote each other frequently and he told his uncle how he no longer thought he was the TPTWP and that he thought it was his son. Meaning he liked his Great uncle and confided in him and probably would be willing to name a child after him.",gameofthrones

69229,"Heh, Davos is my *favourite* character in the series, narrowly ahead of Tyrion. I think it's quite significant that he's the only not-noble-born PoV character (well, unless you count Areo Hotah and the prologue characters) - he provides a valuable perspective.

I don't think there are any POV-characters I dislike. Cersei and Theon are the least likeable ([ADWD spoiler](/b ""though Theon's chapters in ADWD were fucking awesome"") ), but their chapters are still interesting.

I like Brienne as a character, but I have to agree even more with [Ravenloft](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/iz31v/for_those_complaining_about_sansas_chapters_being/c27tadj), [TheYoungGentleman](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/iz31v/for_those_complaining_about_sansas_chapters_being/c27vmku), and [pixeldavid](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/iz31v/for_those_complaining_about_sansas_chapters_being/c27tk3q) - her chapters in AFFC provide some fascinating background to the whole saga (*and* [AFFC spoiler](/b ""she gets to kill some really nasty Brave Companions"") ). Her chapters are even more effective than Arya's in providing an adult perspective on the post-battle plight of the refugees and other seemingly-powerless commoners... and the potential power of the new Faith Militant.

Euron was the mastermind behind the naval battle cus his navy is the best and he needed to prove his worth and he knew where his sisters navy was, all he had to do was wait for them to move. The Iron Bank made Cersi get very active (in terms of winning the war) and, just as, if not more importantly, weigh up her financial options, Casterly Rock is broke (unthinkable for anybody in Westeros to believe), Highgarden is flush, and sacrificing Casterly Rock for Highgarden makes perfect strategic andfinancial sense, especially easily done as nobody was expecting it. Jamie and Cersie also knew (or were expecting) they were coming by boat to take it (according to Tyions monologue) so they knew Euron could use is navy to wipe out their boats when they were unmanned.",gameofthrones

The scene cuts with Cersei still in Maggie's hut. Book readers know that Maggie gives the last bit about the Valonquar for free not as an answer to one of the questions. Not showing Cersei leave the hut leaves room for more that could have been said but not shown. Jamie doesn't know about the prophecy so he doesn't have the same hate for Tyrion as Cersei does. She has already asked him to kill Tyrion after Joffery and Jamie refuses. If she asks again he might ask why the hate, Jamie doesn't believe Tyrion killed Joffery. She then could explain the prophecy to him. The show only reveled the first half of the prophecy because that's all that was relevant to the current seasons story plot. The books introduce plots and leave them hanging for a long time. 
R+L=J was known by every book reader for years now. Not directly but in the book there was plenty of clues. If you only watch the show and never google book spoilers then it would've been a huge revelation! The show makes it clear Jon is lianna's baby by cutting to him from the babies face.

69643,"I never thought of it quite like that, but I'm not really down with it all the way.  See,  the reason so many threads and ideas like yours are popping up is because they are associating Ned's conversation with Arya about being a lady, thar being a Stark at Winterfell means a specific fate,  but this is very baffling to me since other high born women do as they please.  

But let's look at the high born women we know: Cersei Lannister is our evil queen,  she had princes and a princess and that's done now. 

But who else did?  Yara Greyjoy? No. She became a leader of the family's fleet,  chosen by her father.  

Brienne of Tarth? No. Her father raised her to be a fighter. 

Lyanna Mormont. She may be expected to have children,  but she intends to fight alongside her men, just as her mother did. 

Sansa Stark. Well she's been married twice now and both marriages I would say ended badly,  I don't imagine her marrying ever again. In fact,  she'll likely insist one of the men do so. 

Dany Targaryen. Conquerer and queen. Opted to never bare children age her still born,  and doesn't seem to want to marry again, but will use it as a bait tactic.

Margery and Olena Tyrell were not one for sitting back and letting the men make decisions.  They recognized their role, but rose above that to meet their own desires. It was only one other woman of a powerful house that took that away from them: Cersei Lannister. 

Ned's ideas were antiquated,  much like everyone else's ridiculous idea that Arya in Winterfell means she must marry and bare children. Westeros has changed since season 1, let's stop pretending that everything is just as it was back then.  Remember, they need to train women and children how to fight.  Wouldn't that be a more poetic way for Arya to serve her house?  To train little girls how to fight and shoot arrows?",gameofthrones

See you in the next episode where there will an army of the dead, Sam doing things, Jon wields a pick axe. Another character dies. Another castle falls and four more 3 minute major plot points which will whoosh past.

We don't need to see travelling. However big things have happened so quickly this season. How can you care when characters and castles change hands as quickly as pogs in a playground?

I felt last season was slow, too slow. This season feels like I am watching a highlight reel. Also the dialog this season so far feels kinda forced. I can't put my finger on it exactly.
