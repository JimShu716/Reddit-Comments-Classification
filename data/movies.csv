55,"&gt; Deserve: These characters are interesting enough to deserve their OWN movies instead of a movie that has to lean on a number of movies.

Even without references to The Avengers, Capt America is a successful stand-alone story. Moreover, Captain America is *literally* its own movie. 

&gt; Parts of the story are simply hijacked, especially in Thor, in order to talk about SHIELD and so on.

You were initially complaining about CA, not Thor. I agree Thor has more SHIELD stuff, but there's less stuff in CA to get irritated about.

&gt; I'd just rather it be cluttered with fleshed out characters.

How are Captain America and Thor not fleshed out? What more would you require of the earlier screenplays? Each of them has a personality, clear-cut values, and most importantly, they ALL undergo character development. Iron Man was the most successful at this, yes, but Thor and CA also succeed as standalone films.",movies

Even this is done in the most boring way. It's a thing that comes, hits cars, characters look at it, and we're supposed to be impressed. The narrative purpose is that it's Dom's problems coming into the mission, which is fine. But as evidence of creativity this is weak, especially for the setting.

I think the movie really shoots itself in the foot with the earlier training sequence with the cafe explosion and the city folding on itself. These are the money shots, but they happen when it doesn't matter. Narratively they're just a demo, and nothing as remotely interesting as that demo ever happens. Imagine if during their mission they're dealing with driving around on streets folded up like that, or having firefights with people on the other side.

3734,"Film was not essentially filmed theatre back in the 50s and 60s. It was a very well established medium with its own conventions, even before sound was introduced, to an extent, and definitely by the end of the 1930s at the least. There were certainly periods of time in different national cinemas where it was popular to emulate theatre (and other forms of art/entertainment). Think film's relation to vaudeville in the US in the first 10-15 years after it was introduced here. Or the distinct influence that literature had on early Russian cinema. Film wasn't really respected as an art form for awhile, so outside influences and wild experimentation were rampant (which made the silent era really exciting) and the lack of conventions or an established filmic language really let those influences take over. For example, when the Lumière brothers started shooting moving pictures, there wasn't much to go off of other than what they knew because nobody had done this before. So when you look at their work, you can really see their influences from photography come through. The same can be said with Méliès and his background as a magician. This wasn't really the case by the 20s and 30s (there was the introduction of sound and that was obviously a drastic change, but it would be unnecessarily dismissive of the silent era to claim that it hadn't become an established medium with its own conventions).

Sound plays an important part in this question though, because I think we as modern viewers are so used to great video and sound technology and that almost everything we watch is perfectly synced and comparable to what we experience in real time. It was a real pain in the ass to develop sync sound and it is expensive and difficult to shoot. Directors like Godard and Fellini would dub some of their films after shooting and they were not alone (although there were other reasons for this too, like shouting directions and lines). That said, everything isn't as obvious as something like *8 1/2*, but I would argue that there was often just enough of a disconnect for a modern viewer to think that something might be ""off"" even if they can't pinpoint it. This gets covered up a bit with films in a language you don't understand, but even in Hollywood productions that had access to better technology something might still feel off because the sound technology wasn't as good or as reliable as it is today. And even today, sound is one of the hardest technical aspects of filmmaking to get right. So while sound isn't the only reason, I'd argue that it's part of the explanation for it and I definitely disagree with the claim that films and the acting in them were just filmed theatre, especially as late as the 50s and 60s.",movies

I agree with theaxeasssasin the director is shit, but I just could not stop thinking about this movie for some reason. 

So the way I see it Jonah has multiple personality disorder. One being Jonah who's religious, kind and saved. The other being Buster the hermit Y2K conspiracy theorist. They both wanted to leave but Jonah couldn't leave his family and he was too poor to take him with him. Buster was impatient, so he disguised himself as the drifter from the hotel and used Jonah to help him get money to take their family and leave. After Jonah yelled at Buster in the car Buster got pissed because he knew that Jonah would give up on their dream for his family. So Buster came back appealed to Jonah then betrayed him and killed his wife and daughter. I would say the drifter is a 3rd personality but I'll tell you why I don't think so later.

After the funeral he splits into Buster and Jonah. A year or two passes and Buster either forgets about Jonah or doesn't give a shit until he's on the bike and sees the religious program. Buster knows that being a hermit wasn't the right choice so he comes into contact with Jonah. Jonah went and faked his death and lived on the boat to search for answers from God then gets dismayed. When they met, Jonah tried to kill Buster not only because he hates himself but because Buster killed their family.

I was really perplexed by the ""nerdiness"" of Peter, more than I was in any of the Spider-Man films. He's an attractive, smart kid, and he seems to keep to himself. There is no way this kid would get picked on at the rate he does, it's just ludicrous. It's middle school stuff. And did we ever see why Liz likes him? She likes Spider-Man, sure, but Peter is a total flake to her time and time again. I get that he's smart and handsome (as said earlier) but it seems they just made them a thing for the reveal that Vulture was her dad (which was cool). And I hope that this is not the new MJ. She was a fun enough character but I could do without yet another quirky, witty person. Couldn't there be a regular love interest? Liz was better for that. 

The lack of stakes is annoying as well. I think that one character in this entire movie died, and there was a weird quip right after.

Universal's Islands of Adventure currently employs the Avengers, X-Men, Spider-Man, and the Fantastic Four, while Universal Studios Japan employs Spider-Man. Per contract, Disney World and Tokyo Disney cannot install these characters in their parks. However, the contract allows these parks to install any Marvel characters not currently used or connected to the characters used at the Universal theme parks within the same region.

The soundtrack was forgettable; I'm not the biggest Zimmer fan and I don't remember a single memorable piece from the movie.

8178,"&gt; HAS HE MET THE KID. HE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT GOING TO LEAVE IT ALONE.

The point of the movie is Tony barely knows him and through these events gets to know him. He does expect telling him ""stay close to the ground"" is good enough. At the start of the film he sees him as a kid with training wheels on, not an avenger. And definitely sees him as team iron man, not some captain america type who will keep fighting for what's right no matter how many times he gets put down.

&gt; SHIELD? Where were they?

It not entirely unbelievable that they've been selling the weapons and not getting caught but there were people on it. The FBI were notified and then managed to get a taskforce on the ferry pretty quickly, indicating to me there may have been a team with an open investigation there.

&gt; Don't like Aunt May knowing. Just don't.

It works OK in ultimate Spidey. I think Jon Watts and Marisa Tomei can make it work, and it adds a new point of stress for Peter in upcoming films, especially since he won't be clashing with Tony. it's a risky play but we've already had 6 whole movies now where May doesn't know, might as well try something different.

&gt;MJ. That was cheap.

Agree. She'll be a good MJ though.

&gt; Oh, and suddenly Pepper's back

That really irritated me in the cinema for some reason. Then thinking about it later, it makes sense they were back together because of how chaotic and broken an individual Tony is. Of course he'd be on a break then go win her back. And of course Pepper would take him back because he's Tony fricken Stark and she loves the drama. She's had her hand in his chest cavity for gosh sakes. It would have been weird for them to mention it in that context because they're in a private setting, just them and Happy.",movies
8192,"I didn't go in expecting Halloween (1978). I knew it was going to be a different idea. I basically thought of it as fan fiction. 

If you think of it like that, it's an ok movie. It's not great, but it's ok. There's some good stuff in there. There's also some really just... forced... not good stuff in there. 

It's fun to watch around Halloween time, for me. But it'll never touch the original. 

I will say, the scene where little Mikey Myers is beating the kid to death in the woods with the stick, that's Rob Zombie at his best. He really knows how to drive home a brutal scene and give it some emotional resonance. But once he gets out of that comfort zone he's very hit and miss.

My biggest problem is that it felt too rushed. The slow, methodical pacing of Alien was essential to its success, and while we shouldn't just copy the original (it wouldn't work anyway), the rushing around makes a lot of the character deaths lack much weight. I only cared about the death of maybe three characters in Covenant (the two women in the shuttle and the incompetent captain). Alien made you care about all seven members of the crew.

8664,"I think part of the reason is that CGI is in the same place electronic music was in the 80s.

A whole world is newly opened to people and (to quote Jurrasic Park) the director and artists are making decisions bsed on what they *can* do not what they *should* do.

Despite it being held up as an example, I think the hallway scene clip (under 2. Room Scanning) is still a little in the uncanny valley. As the narrator says at 2:45 - ""with animation complete the director can design more compelling camera work for a scene"". But personally I think this is one of its main weaknesses. Just as *Polar Express* looked wrong back in the day because audiences instinctively know how humans move, we also know how *cameras* move and here they neither feel right nor emphasize what the action *means*. It's just ""interesting"" camera movement for its own sake. With all that's happening in an action scene - in the middle of watching, this could be missed but when focused on - it stands out.

Similarly, I think the claw swipe is week. - Sure it's a cool idea, but swiping through half a dozen lockers involves putting each claw through multiple layers of sheet metal that have different thicknesses and different angles at different moments through the swipe. The smoothness of the move contradicts physics principles audiences have experienced their whole lives and feels inauthentic. Much better to cut and show the swipe in a different way, possibly with more power for the audience.

8673,"First of all, how do you interpret me disregarding all other influences from me saying the movies are incredibly closely related? that is literally putting words in my mouth. mind you, it is stemmed from a break down in your logic. In other words, you don't think you're putting words in my mouth. you assume that when one movie has an influence, it could not have another. especially if they are closely related, my god! they then operate in vacuum of influence in which one is a direct product of another, surely.

I don't think Tarantino ripped it off necessarily, but yes I do think he was heavily influenced. Which he was. he was the head judge on the board that gave Oldboy its award at Cannes while he was making the Kill Bill movies and was more than enthused. This interview with Park shows Tarantino's utter astonishment with the film. He supposedly cried multiple times. doubt that happens to him often. 

Secondly, don't be a dick. this is something your parents may have missed, or maybe your a ""businessman"" or lawyer so it works to your advantage in some way, but chill out. be less condescending. it helps nobody, especially not your argument.

Thirdly, how is ""mysterious initial wrong done unto the main character resulting in, or consisting of, an extended confinement"" vague.

This leaves me with a choice between seeing it a different aspect ratio than the director wanted or waiting for a Blu-Ray release that actually shows the entire picture the director wanted me to see. I tend to go with the latter. 

I've also thought about this crop issue a bit as I understand that theaters crop to help fill their screens completely for their audiences, but maybe they could do original aspect ratio times for the film geeks at slower showtimes? I'd go to a 12 o'clock matinee with a smaller picture but a full aspect ratio. ",movies

Example; Pacific Heat and Bojack Horseman exist because Archer, Futurama, and Family Guy are extremely popular shows on Netflix (though I hear Bojack is significantly better in its later seasons) 

Orange is the new Black is, IMHO, their most original and unique show. And I hear Narcos is quite good. Everything else in somewhere in the uncanny valley. Browsing Netflix is like walking though a foreign grocery store. It's like, it's not Doriotos, but it's a triangular corn chip with cheese dust, it's close enough to Doriotos. 

I'm not saying what Netflix does isn't smart, but it does lack a certain creativity and boldness channels like HBO, FXX, and Adult Swim have.

Also, there's never been and never will be a horror movie where the characters make consistently sound decisions to deal with their situation.  Characters fucking up and acting irrationally is the primary plot driver for the genre.  There's just no way to enjoy horror if you're thinking ""Why didn't they...?"" the whole time.

Second, I think the movie is a solid depiction of 12th century politics, religion and social strata.

Ultimate Pete does make it with a load of hotties funnily, but the one thing they all have in common is they're all outcasts too. If a nerdy kid watching this spidey trilogy Marvel are doing needs to see him get with a smokin hottie in order to feel better, maybe that's not a message that's even gonna help in later life anyways. life doesn't get better. It's grim and dark and full of assholes, trumps and haters.

I just think maybe it doesn't matter that Flash isn't a jock and is smart. He's still a rich, popular asshole douche who bullies Pete. This is a school where the hottest and most popular girl is also in the nerd team. I kinda like that because it reflects the value that being intelligent is no bad thing in and of itself. With the rise of anti intellectualism in the world at the moment, this is a more important thing to portray on screen than aspiring to be with the hot girl.

Maybe modeling the fact that Peter, by virtue of being a truly selfless hero, can win over a fully formed human woman with a personality instead might have more value to teach both young boys and girls watching.

Ayer changing that battalion to SS was a Hollywood move because it sounds good to beat them but it completely took me out of the movie. The SS was the most battle hardened and fiercely loyal to the German cause. This wasn't a group of soldiers who have been forced on the front lines like a lot of Germans were at that time, this was the SS. You aren't a soldier in the SS if you haven't earned it. 

So I'll put it this way, if we saw a movie where a a battalion of Marines just throw wave after wave at a tank and get slaughtered in that way most of us would say ""that's ridiculously unrealistic"" and it is. The SS behaving in a moronic way because the plot needed it was really really dumb. That's just tactics too, the true ending with The SS soldier and the main character was worse. I get what Ayer wanted to show us ""hey on the other side they aren't so different than us"" which is true in a lot of cases but not of the SS. The SS ran the concentration camps, a soldier in that battalion does not do that ever. Like ever. 

So I mean again I really really liked that movie until then which just ruined it. It was so absurd to me that i just wasn't even into the movie anymore.

And while I would still really like aspects of Brazil, I doubt I would like it nearly as much as I do with the grim but oddly funny ending it has. 

Likewise, I would probably really like and think fondly of the movie ""A.I."" If it had just ended with the boy robot at the bottom of the sea forever, instead of the surreal schmaltzy robot-alien third act it had. But that's just me.",movies

Basically, Donaldson adapted Wagner's Ring Cycle into a 5-book science fiction story.

Not so basically, the point of the story is a literary game Donaldson challenged himself to accomplish: he wanted to write a story where the bad guys are just complete scum, and yet do the most amazingly noble things. And the good guys have a noble cause, but regularly do absolutely monstrous things. And the characters switch roles a lot between aggressor/victim/rescuer. Turns out these things all happen a lot in the Ring Cycle, so he used it as a template. And didn't have to pay royalties to a long-dead opera composer - cha-ching!

No it wasn't. It was reducing Bev to a sexual object. Eleven year old girls don't ""fight back and triumph"" over fears of their emerging sexuality by deciding to have full-on penetrative sex with all their male friends at once. That doesn't fucking happen. 


You know what an 11 year old girl in Bev's situation *would* do? She would make the first move and kiss the boy she likes. Maybe hold his hand. THE END. 



In the context of the book, that would have worked fine for Bev facing her fears. For her to give voice and action to her and Bill's budding feelings for each other would have been a very brave and scary and *plausible* thing for a eleven year old girl to do. Plus, it could have acted as a ""steeling"" moment for Bill, the defacto leader of their little gang, that gives him the ability to lead them out of the sewers.

One volcano produces more greenhouse emissions than man ever has. But you saw a movie about drowning polar bears. So Science!

&gt; People like you made rational trump voters like me look like a damn joke.

You are neither rational nor a Trump voter. I call bs on both. You've already dug yourself a huge hole with the emotional, incoherent rambling. You also stated something was scientific fact because lots of people believed it. No one believes you're rational. And you seem very reflexive about the liberal thing.

Here's the problem, it's these actors, in this movie. Now I'm not familiar with the source material, but the trailers give me the impression that these two are like the best mercenaries in the business, and I just don't believe it. They're too young to have the experience/wisdom of anyone else, too cocky to want it more than anyone else, and frankly to small to be a physical threat. Everything that I saw highlighted that these two were super experienced, but they were also getting out of conflict by the skin of their teeth. 

I think this would have worked better if they were played up as *inexperienced*, who manage to overcome great odds. I don't blame the actors for the director's decision to cast them as super soldiers, and I know that's where my negative opinion of the film came from based on the trailers. 

That, and it just looked cheap. I know the consensus seems to be that the CGI is incredible, but it just... isn't. Just about every blockbuster this year has had more convincing special effects. 

But I don't think any of that explains why this one failed with general audiences. For them, there was no hook. Besson? No. Just. No. Where is the story, what is this world *about*? The most successful films with GA make you care about what's going on in the story in a 2 minute trailer, so you're interested to see the whole thing.

If you look at information for the battle of Dunkirk (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dunkirk), you will see about 400,000 troops on the Franco-British side, all under command of the Supreme Commander of allied forces, Frenchman Maxime Weygand. About 338K were rescued, the rest were casualties. Of these 338K, 100K were French and evacuated aswell. Thats almost 1 in 3 soldier on the beach being French. 

So the realistic film would have had almost as many British soldiers on the beach as French, both mingling and discussing.

I fully agree with your point about cinematography, but this is not the point here. I am saying the film shows some kind of ethnically 100% british battle of Dunkirk, when the Dunkirk evacuation involved 100,000 Frenchmen from a French city.

Its similar to portraying some major battle of WW2 or WW1 involving multiple nationalities and only portraying one nationality in it. Its pretty much historical revisionism but I accept it because I will enjoy the film as its Nolan making it.

The movie comes down *hard* on the answer of ""Yes, yes it is.  The real world is always preferable to what the Matrix offered.""  But it was also told from the point of view of fanatics (I don't mean that in a negative way; just that they're true-believers in their answer).

I mean, he does have some evolving as a character sure, there is even the Dormammu thing which worked well, but overall there was too much exposition and plain sight thing when it should have been more cyptic in the feels, more mysterious. I feel they immensly sacrificied what could have been an amazing tone for the usual quips (and bad ones in this case), it totally kept the movie from having its own thing.  

To make a mind bending movie you have to be ready to lose some of your audience and that's something Marvel can't do. They can't do psychedelism, they did pulp (and it works wonder for GotG but not for Strange). We should have had more visual storytelling, more symbolism and stuff beyond words. Here even when we are shown the beyond with those amazing visual effect, the Ancient One is giving some quite banale speech. The visual effects ended being more like fractal porn than something purposeful and interesting. Again fractal porn and trippy funky is cool for GotG (especially 2 with the spongey faces when they travel through dimension) but Strange has the potential to be so much more. 

I am even more mad at Marvel because they have all the money, all the fans and all the material to propose something risky. I usually don't care about MCU stuff but I feel close to Strange because of similar life experience, it was such a mised opportunity. I mean, especially when the movie is supposed to open to ""infinite dimension"" and bring something fresh to Marvel's universe. It ended being the same old same old.

28586,"I'd say The Prestige. Its the best use of non linear storytelling IMO because it managed to maintain an engaging linear dramatic narrative while jumping around in time and perspective. Often it cuts to scenes without even suggesting either of the characters are thinking or reading about the past events being shown. The scripting and editing is singularly focused on the audience experience. 

Best example is the scene where Johanson's character goes to see Borden. At first we see it cut off at Borden jokingly asking ""so this is the truth is it?"". Later, when its dramatically relevant, we see her serious and venomous reply. That reply is withheld to be shown at the point it would have maximum dramatic impact *for the audience*. 

It's like the ""I lied, he said it was agony"" moment. That's actually *not* a dramatic moment for Angier because he knew cutter was lying when he'd originally said that anyway. It's a dramatic moment mostly for the audience. Cutter walking away from Angier is the main dramatic beat for the characters.

I also believe some of the dreams where actually real stuff happening, but I don't necessarily believe it had to be done while sleepwalking. Maybe Travis is just that twisted that he does that kind of stuff all along because he is curious and doesn't really think much of his fathers' rules.
Another really crazy hypothesis I have come up with is that he actually had a brother or sister, that got infected before and whom the parents weren't able to kill, just as they're not able to kill Travis in the end. Maybe that brother or sister is roaming in the woods, coming back to the house every once in a while. Maybe they're so strict about the rules because they know what has happened before and can happen again, even if they act as if it never happened because they can't speak about it.

But the form is also valued, and everything that is valued is done so because of its inherent meaning. People may find comfort in a certain type of structures, those structures means something to them, may that be processed consciously or not. So it makes no sense separating meaning from anything, all is meaning, saying something can be meaningful and bad is wrong, it's just valuing some meaning higher than others. 

&gt; For what? References to things which I could actually read and learn from in the time it would take to appreciate BvS.

Now you are depreciating the use of the cinematic medium in this film. This film relies on subjectivity and therefore discovery, you have to look for things. All the movie has done and why I write those things is presenting those elements in a creative form that made me want to look for more. Reading about fertility and castration is not the same as seeing it, one is way more primal, less subjugated to reason. But the process is to understand, and understanding comes from abstract presentation to concrete. 

What the movie does is what Campbell did. Comparative mythology. Showing the links between all those myths. To show they are eternal. I don't remember another work which has done the same, to such an extent. 

Like all mythology, it takes back an existing pattern and model it to fit modern time. Hence the ""creative form"". Those are not references, they are not applied to the letter, they are digested, transformed. 

Which means the movie is meta gain. It says to us Superman is a mythological being that is relatable to older mythological being (Lex made it even clear when the list names of different Sun figure throughout history) and the movie is a mythological tale that reenacts older mythological tale. This meta aspect is pure form and substance as one. 

Same thing for say (they are many but one of my favorite): symbolism. Superman is a living symbol, a mythological being, a fantasy. Impact on Bruce and Lex: blurs the light between dreams and reality, fantasy and concrete. So the inside is out. What does the movie do: use a lot of symbolism. Symbolism is basically inside out, it's the relation of psychological processes (and complex) to the outside world. Then the viewer is transported into a movie that is realistic but imbued with a dream like logic. The viewer finds himself in the same place as the characters, the movie looks for confusion (which we never see in blockbusters as they all spoon feed you). This is a meta on symbolism and a perfect use of symbolism. Symbolism is a unique tool for the cinematic medium, it takes its root in the very magical act of the ""vision"", something that can only be translated by graphical art, and in movement by cinema or animation. 

Even more, the film reverses the trope of the Cycle of Age found in Excalibur. Superman brings the dawn of a new Mythological Age. Therefore the film uses mythological logic: I repeat myself but the subconscious is projected onto the outside world. That is how our ancestors saw the world. That why they thought that if the King plunged a spear into a hole of Holy water, the land would be prosperous. It's metaphorical. But our ancestors believed that if they did not enact or rather translated the symbolical realities of their mind into the world, things would go wrong (surprise, they did!). I don't know if you realize how spiritual this movie is and again meta. Superman brings a spiritual harmony at the end of the film, the film in its form seeks such awakening. Having a film so spiritual that shits on the rational reasoning in our day and age and that was made with 250 freaking million is ""interesting"" and it is ""new"", whatever that means. 

I don't think you can understand the message of the film without the layers, you can on a subconscious level maybe but it doesn't feel complete. The act of discovery is what is important, what is important is figuring out your answers for yourself because again that is what the characters do inside the story and what the HJ is about. 

There is definitely a lot of stupidity regarding the reception of this movie. The reactions on my post reflect it perfectly (I strived to take roots and write my post as BvS was, just omitted the symbolism because that would make everyone crazy), people reacted on the behalf of how they perceived the movie without trying to understand the logic of my post. Like nobody tried to understand the logic of the movie. It's nice to see you can't stop the meta. 

I don't care if people didn't like the movie or found it ""bad"", I don't want to change that. That's their subjective experience. I want to share something meaningful and have a discussion about it. Yet people are totally closed to stepping out of their own perspective (and we all are,w e can philosophy on that, I received the movie better because I think more like the guys who made it maybe, but that makes my envy to share all the most important), so of course a movie with a perspective that is different from the usual would be rejected (there's no absolute, I am not saying that is the only reason, but it would be foolish not to consider). Sadly, everything that is a bit alien doesn't land to good among people who like so much their ""sci-fi"". 

What is very funny is that subjectivity (meta again, I know it's beginning to be boring:""what we do is we project ourselves unto him""). That is exactly what happens when someone says ""Snyder didn't think about the quarter of what you said"". On one side there is someone like me who has thought about it and therefore think it was intended. On the other hand, we have someone who saw nothing in it and project that attitude to the Creator. So both time there is projection. And, this is where it gets funny and why I purposefully have chosen ""Creator"": that is exactly the problem of spirituality vs pessimism (materialism if you will). Was the universe (seen as a creative act) purposefully intended or was it all a gamble. And that is again something that drives the movie (I know, we drown into so much meta-ishness), that dichotomy. People react to the unknown, Superman, in two ways: 

- Fear, the primal reaction to something unknown that can harm you, harm your self-ego. The unknown is something from the outside so integrating it modifies the structure of personality (yet again where the movie is magnificent is that this alien represent something that is so deeply within us and therefore demands us to reconnect with ourselves through the stranger/the other, inside out). 

- and Hope. Hope is faith. It is the belief in the benevolence of the flow of life, of the plan of the universe. Superman is beyond humanity (he can represent God, the next step in evolution, whatever), some have hope in the inherent ""capacity of every living being to do good"", to strive for life, to preserve life (which is again why there is all that thing about birth/creation/etc)

The movie presents us with those different subjective. People reaching for the Superman, people fearing him. Now that you have all the meta I let you have the deduction regarding the film and its reception, and what is my mean way. 

This all thing about ""reaching"" and seeing more than the author is also a serious misunderstanding of what art is. Any great works of art grow way beyond the limit of what it was intended because it implies that it creates such an assemblage that the birth of new structure is possible effortlessly. Any person who has gotten into a creative flow knows she is no more in control but resting in the hands of our subconscious and guided by force greater than him, he is merely a vector for the creative flow, a gateway. It would then be foolish to assume the author is conscious about all the things that his work implied. He is not omniscient. 

... All of that is also why reading my post independently of BvS doesn't matter. It stands on its own ...

Hope you enjoyed the ride.

Extra cooki in the jar: 

&gt;People talk about watching the film 6-10+ times before 'getting it'

I have seen BvS four or five times, I don't watch it much because you need to be in the mood. But I have surely thought about it and discussed it way more. I don't know what is your point about the rewatching thing, how is that not a good thing? It's great. It's like being reborn again and again to finally have an awakening. it's very Nietzschean too I guess. But yes, it is far from ""instant gratification"". Mulholland Drive is hated by some for the same reason, but me I have enjoyed the hell out of that psychoanalytic analysis of a man who saw the movie more than 30 times, and he doesn't say he understands it. Or more, that he understands it in his way but do not deny other interpretation of the film. It's exactly what BvS does, it was the point of Sucker Punch too: create your own interpretation of what you saw: it's confronting you to your subjectivity as a viewer. In BvS it's even meta again because there is all that thing about fertility and richness of the soil (metaphor for the soul/mind): the film is fertile and rich and you can grow flowers from it. But you are confronted to your ability to do so. ",movies

35598,"Okay, I am describing the nature of the inherent conflict, and taking time to point out that the *best* parents have this issue, so I'm obviously not taking the stance that the parents in this situation are basely wrong about anything. I have every sympathy for parents who take issue with the way things are done at a school. I understand that it is their right, and if they handle themselves appropriately and approach the problems they encounters constructively, then everyone wins - student, teacher, and parent. I also see that any parent who is appropriately involved in their child's life is going to run into problems of this kind, and it would be surprising if they or their kid's teacher was right every time. This is about developing an appropriate relationship and respecting the boundaries of the role of parent and teacher.


Unfortunately, in the passive aggressive age of electronic communication, people often make the mistake of either reacting before they contextualize that which they are reacting to, or get angry instead of trying to solve problems. What happens in both of these scenarios is that they interfere with their children's education, develop antagonistic relationships with their children's instructors, and most importantly, the problems they are trying to identify usually go unaddressed. Or even worse, the problems escalate past the teacher and they teach their children all kinds of bad lessons about acting entitled and getting your way by circumventing existing systems with privilege or volume.


So listen - as a teacher, I was very open to questions about my curriculum and the materials we worked with. Further, when parents approached me with issues in an appropriate setting in an appropriate way, I worked hard to find solutions that worked for everyone involved. Unfortunately, more often I had to deal with parents calling me out in front of a group, or screaming at me with no particular agenda or solution, or trying to push an ideology or set of ideologies which had no place in public education (not just religion - also bad psychology, dogma, and 9/11 induced fear of the world).


And before there are any responses which have anecdotes in them, let's just get right out ahead of that and say that the blame in this type of conflict can side with the teacher just as easily as with the parent, and I have friends who are parents that have had bad interactions with teachers whom I sided with, and colleagues who were teachers that were out of line on issues of this kind. Shit - I've been on the wrong side of this argument before plenty of times, though I like to think I was usually able to achieve equanimity before closing out most issues permanently. No anecdote can change the basic issues at stake, however, or what can be done by reasonable people to minimize the difficulties and help kids to grow and learn about themselves and their world.

The return of Sigourney Weaver to the franchise would build a lot of hype. Fox could probably force a decent screenwriter to work with Blomkamp so the dialogue isn't shit.

**edit: couln't let this gem of a reply by u/neotropic9 get buried:**

&gt;It's no wonder The Martian took best comedy.
Damon's comedic timing was consistently on point. The role was a departure from Damon's typically dramatic films, and he nailed it. The Martian is a laugh-a-minute romp. The film follows funny man Watney across the 4th planet from our sun, interspersed with scenes of zany hijinks from his plucky fellow astronauts. Despite the superficially tense scenario, Damon is able to maintain an atmosphere of playfulness throughout, ensuring that the movie doesn't slip from laughs into nail-biter territory.
One thing is for sure, the laughs don't let up. Like when NASA director tells the audience, “Astronaut Mark Watney... was killed.” Of course, we know better! Imagine NASAs surprise when a lowly analyst finds out that Mark Watney has been moving things around on the planet of Mars. He's not actually dead, but stranded. Whoops! But if you think they're going to tell the crew, you've got another thing coming. Wait until you see how NASA's director tries to weasel out of letting the crew know -and then trying to nix the rescue mission! After that fiasco, we see one of the greatest comedic twists of the movie, when Watney's captain, deciding to violate mission orders to save the life of a crew member, says, “this is mutiny.”
Stranded on Mars, Watney's survival becomes increasingly unlikely. The people of Earth wait for the inevitable. But then, by combining the science and engineering of his friends at NASA, the bravery of his crew, and his own force of will, Watney is able to travel to another vessel and modify it for a triumphant escape, in an ending that can only be described as hilarious. Knocked unconscious by the g-force (good gracious!) and then woken up only to find he has broken ribs (ha!) Watney has to leap into the arms of a fellow astronaut on the end of a tether (that's a new one!). Needless to say, the audience was left in stitches. (Speaking of stitches, one of the film's strongest comedic moments comes when Watney is forced to sew up his own bleeding wounds, grimacing and shaking throughout.)

Even if the local foods didn't even resemble a sandwich in the slightest, I'd not consider that a major hurdle to accepting the broad detail of the story either since again, for English speaking audiences it could very likely have just been shorthand for 'light food' which also works regardless of the time of day as well.

Kowalski was fun, sure, and felt like a real Harry Potter character, but *everyone* else, bar none, felt like cardboard cut-out people being dragged about to different plot-points on pieces of string so they could interact with bad CGI animals.

Its like they decided they were going to adapt Fantastic Beasts, then got to the storyboard, drew a blank and said ""well how about we just introduce all the old Harry Potter stuff but this time its in *New York Citayyyy*, we'll have a Minister for *American* Magic, *American* Hogwarts, the Ministry for *American* Magic, *American* Three Broomsticks, *American* Muggle Slang"" and so on.

43556,"That last sentence must be some of the most pretentious crap I've read. I also disagree with your relation to Nietzsche

First of all, Nietzsche is one of the most well known Western Philosphers in recent history. Nearly all rudimentary brush strokes courses of Western Philosophy talk about Nietzsche. I'm willing to bet this guy knows about him, as do most read individuals.

Secondly, you mentioned the fountainhead so I assume you know Rand. So you should also know that Snyder has an eternal hard on for the philosophy of Ayn Rand. Objectivism and Nihilism share similarities, but Objectivism is more concerned with shedding the mediocre persons of society to become better, vs Nihilism shedding the constraining ideas of society (mostly like you said Christian morality). In the movies Superman mostly debates himself over shedding the people and forgetting them, rather than shedding the constraining higher morals.  This distinction is subtle but important, because no one in either film has much in the way of Christian or High minded morals. Instead they have Objectivism morals, where everything is concerned about people and great people and what to do with great people and how people just don't understand great people (even though his dads both say this btw, they also contradict it in other statements)

While Nietzschen Nihilism and Randian Objectivism have similarities, I like to think Objectivism is the next step. Not only is man not beholden to God, but man is not even beholden to man. Personally I think all of this is half baked in the movies and at the very base level in Philosophy and while worth talking about to introduce some of these ideas, really doesn't flesh them out.",movies

44688,"The theater experience isn't inferior as a fact, but it is less desirable for many. It's an opinion thing. There's a large part of the market that would go to the theater less or not at all if they'd have the option to watch new movies for a decent price at home. Others prefer going to the theater, or only go for a couple dates / family outings a year and would continue to do that even if offered the option of viewing a new movie at home.

Watching at home gets you the benefits /u/WeylandTheDwarf mentioned and more. It can save time (travel, organisation especially with kids), money (from condiments, parking, travel), it can prevent the annoyance of loud or obnoxious theater goers (phone screens, talking / yelling, popcorn throwing, people walking in and out) and provides more freedom (to pauze, talk / discuss more freely, choose own beverages / foods, watch the kids / be there if they need anything).

Watching in the theater is more about going out, it's a bit more of an event, the quality of picture and sound can be better (depending on the theater and the home setup), and at least for now, you get to watch newer movies.

I'm pretty sure both preferences are strongly present in the market - enough to warrant offering movie fans the choice (with movies screening in theaters and at home at the same time), instead of theaters having a monopoly on new movies. I say let the consumer choose - theaters will end up with the audience that specifically wants to be there, which should be enough for them to survive (though possibly in downsized form). And movie studios can make good money from theaters and from streaming home release, if the business model is well thought out.

I don't think big studios will be quick to work with Netflix for new movies, but over time, and with Netflix offering the right price / business model (like a per-movie fee or premium subscription that works for all parties), it may happen. Or another party, like a consortium of movie studios or another third party besides Netflix could get it done at some point. The theater-only window is anti-choice and archaic in my opinion, even though I have nothing against the theater and go several times a year. I'd just like to choose for myself for every movie.",movies

46392,"Nearly *every* movie treats its subject matter as a commodity to some degree, the exploitation ""genre"" is just more brazen about it because that's the whole point of it.

It's *supposed* to appeal to the lowest common denominator and just be stylish and entertaining in the cheapest possible way, not at all unlike the gangster pictures of the 30s, the scifi B-movies of the 50s, the vixen road movies of the 60s and the schlock &amp; slasher horror of the 70s and 80s. Difference is, blaxploitation is ultimately a specific type of exploitation made for entertainment for a specific audience, made by specific people. As such, it can only be considered empowering, since they refuse to bow to social standards. Even if it is a form of cultural segregation, it is self-imposed by the people themselves since black audiences flocked to see those films. If blaxploitation films revived today get a broader audience, great, but they won't reinforce any other sense of ""otherness"" than is already present in the audience if they don't. There are plenty of other types of cultural segregation, to be sure, like the gentrification and stratification of city planning, but all blaxploitation did was exploit a previously untouched market. It never aimed to segregate or provide some kind of social schism, it only meant to entertain those who found themselves underrepresented in film, no different than any niche audience.

For someone so quick to dismiss the genre as racist, you're subject to quite a bit of historical revisionism yourself. Blaxploitation was always explicitly geared at black audiences and by and large made by black filmmakers. Studios started backing some and tried to copy their success after the fact, yes, but were largely unsuccessful (the only studio-led ""blaxploitation-inspired"" film that was a genuine hit is to my knowledge Live and Let Die). Toward the end of the era, the blaxploitation novelty had worn off as the disco age came about, but even as black filmmakers stopped making blaxploitation films, the few white directors that took up the mantle weren't studio shills or part of any deliberate effort of anyone to water the genre down or sell it to whites. They were B-movie directors trying to make a quick buck for themselves, working either independently or for companies like AIP who didn't give a shit about content or audience as long as it made money. And if you look at the films, they're virtually indistinguishable from the blaxploitation films directed by black filmmakers - and very deliberately so. If you want to cash in on another movie's audience, you do your best to copy it. There were a few exceptions of course, but none of those were particularly successful or entered into the public discourse the way the earlier films were. There's a reason why the genre died out - black people weren't watching it anymore and whites never really were.

And the studios didn't cheapen anything. Black filmmakers did that themselves. They were originally inspired by social criticism and all, but don't kid yourself - the first of the black wave movies were still hugely exploitative because that's what they thought they had to do in order to earn money, particularly when black filmmakers actually started to go behind the camera instead of just in front. Bear in mind that both Night of the Living Dead and Putney Swope were made by white filmmakers, while the genre you're so quick to dismiss was primarily made by black filmmakers.

They threw in some violence and gratuitous nudity to put more butts in the seats, that's all. Sweet Sweetback's Badasssss Song was one of the first big black wave hits and was absolute trash, mostly on purpose. The studios bankrolled Shaft, sure, but it still remained a uniquely Gordon Parks-led movie. And even so, the primary audience remained black Americans and the filmmakers remained black. Every last movie of the main blaxploitation phase was made by black directors and any effort to copy those successes failed miserably. The blaxploitation genre died out because 

There is definitely a propagation of a media stereotype of black people among white audiences, but that's not born out of blaxploitation culture. That's born out of the post-modernist backlash/parody to social criticism movies like In the Heat of the Night, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner and Blackboard Jungle. Those movies were far more successful with white audiences and eventually led to the late 80s/90s revival of mainstream movies tackling racism and gang culture among black people (along with the explosion of hiphop and rap music) like Do The Right Thing, Boyz N the Hood, Menace 2 Society etc. *Those* are the movies that started whatever black stereotypes there are in cinema today, along with deliberate efforts of diversity in mainstream television, like the Cosby Show, Fresh Prince, Benson, Family Matters etc. None of those made any effort to copy the blaxploitation genre at all.

I dare you to find a single average white person today who's actually seen Superfly, Coffy, Cleopatra Jones or even the original Shaft. I doubt you'd even find anyone who could tell you what a blaxploitation movie *looks like* outside of cineasts.

If they're going to revive the blaxploitation genre, I'm completely down with that, because what it represents still doesn't correspond in the slightest to the mainstream media stereotype of black people. Yes, they depict violence and crime while starring black people, but it's really no different than the Hollywood mainstream action-crime genre in the first place. Are we supposed to associate white people with violence now too? Correlation isn't causation, and I think any discerning viewer old enough to watch these films can understand that.

The visuals, music and style of blaxploitation is pretty much otherwise nonexistent in mainstream media and culture depictions of black people. In fact, the only reminder I've seen in the past 2 decades of Hollywood films of the genre is when they featured the Superfly soundtrack in Captain America The Winter Soldier. That's how far removed those films are from mainstream American culture, and exactly as far removed it is from those negative stereotypes you're afraid they will reinforce.

Today we're in a different climate than the one you describe. Ethnicities of all kinds are becoming so integrated into every movie, into every TV show that it's gone beyond tokenism and pushed us into a broader diversification discourse where the new battlefield has been moved to gender issues instead. There still exists racism to be sure, but for the past year it's been taking on an overt backlash form *against* the entertainment industry diversifying, not something propagated by it. Black culture itself is becoming so mainstream that it's virtually indistinguishable from American culture at large, precisely *because* of the entertainment industry. R&amp;B is the biggest genre there is now and is appropriated by whites, latinos, even asians. Meanwhile, tons of movies and TV shows askew typical portrayals of black characters as entrenched in their own subculture. Most black characters in film and TV today could easily be switched out with white actors and vice versa and it would hardly make a difference, that's how integrated we've all become.",movies

I loved the fact that there was no ''soldier nursing his dying buddy in his arms'' scenes but hated the [ scene at the climax where the Commander closes his eyes expecting to die but is saved at the last second]. Aside from this it was almost cliché-free. I also loved the way the movie depicted the most mundane deaths - usually it's the combat roles that grab the most honourable mentions, but in Dunkirk it depicts those trapped below decks meeting their ends as much as anybody. The music was a bit cloying (too much ''something's about to happen'' quickening of the tempo) but otherwise sufficiently moody and dense. I was genuinely on the verge of embarrassing myself with tears a couple of times during Dunkirk, which is an amazing achievement given most films nowadays just do not resonate with me at all, plot and/or characters.

The main difference with Raimi's is that his *friends* were actually decent people who didn't immediately flip out for the sake of creating drama.

Everything is the governemnt (Stark is a Senator) reacting to a domestic terrorist attack by extending the law at the cost of people's anonymity and personal freedoms.

There is always an element of interpretation that one has to apply to a story, especially a deep one.

And you know what?

---

summary

---

It was ok. Completely mediocre. Visually appealing. It got a few hehs and smirks out of me. It has a lot more internet humor than the trailers shown and the variety of apps in that phone is pretty wide. Whoever wrote the movie at least *knew* what the hell they were talking about with technology. Of course, outside of dialogue, the visual representation of this stuff is pretty much Wreck it Ralph. Story-wise, it's kind of like Lego movie, only less randumb (which I'm not hating, I loved Lego movie). They hop from app to app, much like Lego hops from set to set. References are made, plot is advanced. I did not like the romance too much. I felt the love between Meh and Princess to be forced and unnecessary, and the progression to the love stage went too quick (it literally took one school day). Despite the love subplot the dialogue between the three (hi-5, meh and princess) when it *wasn't* about love was pretty good.

Voice Acting, Humor, Animation and Plot

---
The voice acting was great in this movie. Everyone does a good job in their respective roles and I enjoyed Patrick Stewart's limited role as the poop emoji. It's pretty clear he's there for shits and giggles. Although in the ending scene, there's a part where you can tell Hi-5's dialogue was forced in... his mouth doesn't move according to his line.

Sony's animation is always good and crisp. While pixar goes for photorealism, Dreamworks goes for atmosphere, and illumination is all around shitty, I find Sony's to be the most fluid and consistently good. Their movies may be on the bad side but the animation is never terrible.

Humor wasn't forced but not always funny - sometimes it connects into [this gif](http://i.imgur.com/8h51nGo.gif), sometimes it's eye-rolling, or sometimes it gives you a slight groan with a smirk. Occasionally a chuckle. It's hit or miss humor. 

The pacing was fine as far as I can tell. Since this took heavy inspiration from Lego Movie, it basically follows that formula. No one scene lingers on too long, the plot is predictable but never confusing. There weren't any obscenely stupid plot breaking things things where I'd be muttering wtf under my breath. There are 3 subplots. The main is for Meh, the second is for Mr. and Mrs Meh looking for Meh (and rediscovering their love), and the 3rd is the User (human) trying to impress a girl at school but failing because his phone's acting all retarded.

score 

---

**If I were to be honest on this movie as a grade test, it is a D. Barely passes.**

I didn't stand up and say **""that was fucking shit""** like when I did with Despicable Me 3, or Alien Covenant, or Baywatch. At complete face value, it's a passable film. I didn't care about the 'advertisements' - it's a fucking smartphone featuring today's popular apps. I don't care about who was involved in the film - that's for after the movie, not during. The rest of the theater loved it. Or at least didn't bash it. It was mostly kids and family, with some groups of middle schoolers and high schoolers. In fact, leaving the theater I heard a lot of people actually surprised it was decent. The parents and teenagers with their group said they thought it was going to be terrible but some parts were funny. I look at this thread and I see a 0% score... I think this is one of those movies the critics already hated before watching. Reading some of the reviews there, it's clear by the attitudes who's shitting on it for fun and who cared to review the movie. Those who cared to review will tell you the same. They'll give you 4 or 5/10s and tell you it's unoriginal or bland. And they're right. This is unoriginal. It's going to be dated. I probably wouldn't waste $10 like I did if i knew what I was in for, but I wouldn't mind paying $5 on a bargain day.

This movie is going to be very popular when it gets on Netflix. Then we'll be hearing on reddit ""DAE think the Emoji wasn't *that bad*?""

I will confess that I did spend several minutes early on in the film trying to figure out how eight years had passed since the battle of New York shown in The Avengers (2012) and this current film in 2017. Did I miss a time ""jump"" in one of the other MCU films? I know Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is set more or less immediately after Guardians 1, and we'll get them all caught up in time for Infinity War, but this seems like the opposite problem. Has anyone out there made a MCU timeline that explains this, or is this an oversight on the part of the filmmakers?
Anyway, I think Sony/Marvel are on the right track with this re-boot, both in terms of tone and action.
Speaking of action in general, I know that most crime (and therefore crime-fighting) takes place at night, but it is so hard to follow fast-paced, rapid-edited fight sequences in the dark. I appreciate when directors find ways to have action sequences happen during the day, and I think that night sequences are fine, but they need to be edited a little differently. Or is that just me?
Night or day, though, it's still easier than watching Michael Bay's Transformer battles, which a fight choreographer I knew refers to as ""filming forks in a blender.""

The moment she is shot the gentle smile still lingers on her face, the hit man coldly try to keep her in place as they re load even fumbling with the shells. She heads out of the bedroom to hug her cat. This small gesture says a lot about the character. It instantly humanises her, giving her a maternal side, someone that appreciates life and is able to love. We begin to empathise with her, although we realise it's too late.

65625,"&gt; Perhaps I should clarify. Nolan can put a story together, but he mainly suffers from weak character writing. He does have interesting scripts with interesting ideas, but it's really testament to his weakness when his best characters, IMO, were from the Batman films. 

Aside from the Batman movies, there are a handful of movies that really don't have weak characters: ""The Prestige"", ""Insomnia,"" ""Memento"". Really enjoyed the main protagonist of ""Inception"", even though the side characters can be considererd a bit unidimensional. Besides, his brother, Jonathan Nolan, usually writes with him, who recently wrote ""Westworld"", a fine show on character building. Christopher Nolan is a gifted storyteller, but his movies wouldn't reach the heights they did, if its characters were always shallow.

If someone had come up with a great story first, and that inspired Disney to make the movie, and then they made the movie in a way that gave confidence to the idea that it actually was a great story, then I would expect an enjoyable movie.

""Up to 2003, Joel received sole credit for directing and Ethan for producing, due to guild rules that disallowed multiple director credits to prevent dilution of the position's significance. The only exception to this rule is if the co-directors are an ""established duo"". Now that they are able to share the director credit (as an established duo), the Coen brothers have become only the third duo to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director.

The issue with watching 70mm print as opposed to an IMAX 70mm print is the cropping. You lose no detail but suddenly you're missing half the image. So personally I would say opt for one of the digital IMAX screens (in which the film is still cropped from IMAX 70mm but not as much) over 70mm because film is a visual language.

It means that when you solve a problem with violence, it tells people its ok to be violent, which causes more people to be violent.
