Even though we increased jobs by 500k it was the people who stopped looking for work that actually impacted the unemployment rate.\n\nIf you compare that scenario to how it should go including people not looking for work you get a 50% unemployment and for the job increase 46% because playing with numbers the government can make it seem like theres a much lower unemployment rate then there actually is. ,canada

Automation would imply a robot is making the burger which will soon be the case.\n\nYou seem to be misunderstanding me. Automation was great it let our economy flourish and because new jobs opened up we didn't see as many jobs lost. But what will all the truck drivers do if they're laid off due to automation? What new jobs will open up from that what about all the to Hortons and McDonald's workers? Automation in those sectors aren't making more jobs down the road because they are the end of the road typically. \n\nLike think of the assembly line. It created hundreds of jobs. But once automation hit a certain point most of those job gains were lost to robots. Efficiency grew but jobs were lost. This is the exact same thing but this time with nothing to replace it. ,canada
