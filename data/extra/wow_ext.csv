84726,They should start restricting everything like this. You can only transmog ICC gear during the two weeks around the anniversary of when the raid came out originally. Monks can only transmog at all for two weeks around the anniversary of MoP\u2019s release. You can only transmog crafted items for two weeks around the anniversary of when the character that crafted it learned the skill level required to make it. ,wow

86294,The Legion is nothing without Sargeras though. Just more fodder for rando adventurers. ,wow
86650,Antorus is great.\n\nNot Eonar tho. ,wow
86788,You could level a Highmountain Tauren to earn the armor then race change your main to use it,wow
87226,BUT THATS JUST A THEORY\nA GAME THEORY,wow
87229,I need the number of that chiropractor for my back problems.,wow
87498,As far as the game or community goes? Not really. It's controlled and limited in such a way as to be a nice perk without adding toxicity or feeling obligatory. ,wow
87770,Yeah. Hopefully Blizz jokingly refers to it in their next hotfix note,wow
88039,[deleted],wow
88273,Also no projection issues on any of our maps. That would only be possible if the planet was flat. (Or much much much much larger than we think),wow

89593,"Anduin to Velen: \""You... are not coming with us ??\""",wow

93419,People are reading into this whole Sargeras stabbing Azeroth thing way too much.\n\nIt's going to make about as much sense as giant space giants. Just go with it.,wow
93619,I don\u2019t like warframe but I play league and they do a fucking amazing job at optimising while still making graphical improvements for people with good pcs and I love them for it,wow
93974,Happened to me about 2 weeks ago on our heroic kj farm. Aggro kept switching to our holy pally even though me and the other tank were taunting.,wow
94171,"I KNEW IT! Looks much better and accessible than \""Complete 123 quests in xxx zone\""",wow
94377,I'd put money on them being in 7.3.5 but as a preorder bonus for BfA.,wow
95860,Zandalari and void elves? Probably not. The other races since they're technically all already in game and we have access to them? Maybe.,wow
97226,it will take its time. 7.3.5 is hitting ptr now. You can expect a fair amount of time and testing. But some big hotfixes will hit pretty soon so thats happening.,wow
97368,Those totems! Gives me hope that when we finally get a shaman allied race for alliance it'll have awesome totems. ,wow

113056,You seen how much space some of those apps take up?  That's a lot of space for something I don't use.  I only use the authenticator app now and I don't want to wait until my crappy little phone has loaded all the companion app assets just to get my authentication code.,wow

116059,Ol' Eagle knees now.,wow

123755,Or you're one of the folks using Madman's Luggage.,wow
124002,Also Baine and Anduin are friends. It would make an interesting dynamic for their nations to be at war.,wow
124688,They guy who leaked BFA on mmo-champion said we were getting 4 sub races in 7.3.5 so most likely we will.\n\nhttp://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2249901-Battle-for-Azeroth-Alpha-Beta-General-Discussion/page1510?p=47735674#post47735674,wow
125550,So we off Sylvanas at the end of the expansion and put Baine on the chair. All in favor?,wow
126414,F,wow
126503,I bet you're secretly a human.,wow
126923,10 separate bosses,wow
128012,That\u2019s the whole point. He isn\u2019t a film critic. He\u2019s an asshole. Or something like that. Funny is subjective of course. I would say anyone watching the EWW without having seen the movie first probably wasn\u2019t going to see the movie. ,wow
128128,Mhm,wow
128265,Make a better assumption and don't say sylvannas as she's already on her 4th life.,wow

129614,I still think it'll be a preorder thing and they're just waiting for that to announce them.,wow

137895,Uh uh they need to wait in line. SH has been through too much pain.,wow
138421,We dont know the story I dont know why you guys are defending him because he posted a picture here.. maybe he was being the most toxic in the instance thats why he got kicked,wow

140481,Garrosh as cinematic Garrosh as cinematic Thanos,wow
140585,I've put quite a bit of time into a Night Elf Druid and I kinda stuck with it. I'm only missing an 110 Rogue and I have some duplicate classes on both factions. I used to just start over constantly until I felt like I rather be playing my moonkin. Then I realised I had amassed quite a few achievements and questlines on that character. \n\nSaying that... I've always wanted to be a Highmountain Tauren. But I cannot force myself to like Orgrimmar and Sylvanas and killing gnomes :( ,wow
141030,*Thinking in Lor'themar*,wow
141270,I'm not dissing the mount. I'm just saying an allied race isn't going to have as many color options as a full race.,wow
141757,Nathanos lookin gooooood ;),wow
142690,Well my understanding is LBRS won't scale above 60 and that's one of the best farms once you get the route down ,wow
143184,Not happening,wow
143215,Yea shes confirmed as a the strongest titan and a female in chronicles,wow
143262,&gt; would make for some juicy ~~lore~~ rule 34\n\n,wow
143273,Greymane is making sure that he thinks that. Lust for revenge twisted him into a monster on the inside just as the worgen curse made him a monster on the outside.\n\nThe fact that he is willing to let the Legion win in order to get revenge against the Warchief means that there can be no peace as long as he leads Gilneas.,wow
143398,Please finish that thought?  You believe it was better to sit in Resto and heal nonexistent damage and slow our clear time?  ,wow
144131,This made me laugh harder than it should've. ,wow
144215,Why do you say that? There\u2019s plenty of evidence dictating that we will.,wow
144317,I see them going live before BfA. Maybe to fill in the gap of no content between now and then. That\u2019s just my hunch/opinion. ,wow
144865,Actually it does change something; the zones scale up not down. Finishing quest lines is how some people like to level,wow
145005,My guild wiped 4 times due to the laser beam on Kin'garoth but we one shot Aggramar and Argus... haHAA,wow
145376,The max level of the zone is that upper cap. So if you hit 81 then the BC-Wrath cluster stops scaling with you.\n\nYes also if you clear Antorus on live Argus will go ,wow
145679,I\u2019d kill for cataclysm and pandaria to scale to 100..,wow

148826,Yowzah.  I know why Sylvannas fell for Nathanos now!,wow
149299,A bit awkward that you mixed up camera distance and view distance when you made this rant.,wow
149655,YES! Bearded Elves IN :D,wow
150035,I believe that makes the most sense - I like the idea of being a hero under the command of one of the lore champions far more than being  a prominent force in Azeroth myself.,wow
151324,I think they said they were adding 3 or 4 extra character slots. Not sure when they'll be added though.,wow
151602,Aye!,wow
151931,For not blindly accepting victim mentality with no explanation? K.,wow
152874,If you go the the blasted lands on a fresh toon it displays the WoD version. You can talk to some one to switch it to the post cata version but by default it is WoD version,wow

159400,Dont feel bad. Not to long ago i would get /kicked for just being a hunter lol,wow
159597,To be honest... They probably had this sword already in mind when they increased the draw distance. Expansions are in the pipeline so early that I have no doubt this particular sword was at least one of the driving factors for increased draw distance.,wow
160252,Old Karazhan Midnight maybe? ,wow

164463,An illusion. What are you hiding?,wow

165271,A reasonable reaction ,wow

176887,Greymane and Sylvanas need a round of make-up sex.,wow
179585,I'm saying because Blizzard retcons stuff so fast that information quickly becomes outdated. Evidence from the game hints that Ner'zhul is still alive both how we see his soul inside the shards of Frostmourne AND how Bolvar has certainly changed his behaviour during the Legion expansion ,wow
180577,Theres a decent amount to see on the PTR actually.\nWhat are you trying to attempt by doing this? This can't be considered a summary if you don't include relevant information. \n\nMy point is - If you want to summarize whats available at least make sure to include everything first.,wow

187122,[deleted],wow
187702,[deleted],wow
188024,Have they announced what the racial mounts will be?,wow
188852,I would say neither of those things points to Ner'zhul being a thing. We have the shards of Frostmourne which is not attached to Bolvar in anyway. Bolvar's new attitude as Lich King also does not imply anything about the existence of Ner'zhul.,wow
189370,Impossible. They'll act like they'll give him something but then at the last minute cut him from current content. Such is tradition.,wow
190173,Not silly. You do indeed need a quest to get quest items,wow
190273,Probably January or February. There's going to be a 110 boost in the coming months (most likely with the pre-purchase) so you can just use your current one now if you want.,wow
190409,I hate the way my human and Draenei look on the Grove Warden. I'll have to give it a try on my Tauren.\n\nI'm seriously considering switching from Warrior to Druid or Shaman after seeing the new forms with new totems.,wow
190626,i guess azeroth is just a super small planet.,wow
191250,So don't go the same path? You are free to travel to another zone and level once you reach the minimum. There are always other zones available.,wow

193119,thank you. could be the most helpful advice of all haha. :D,wow

208690,Do you think old selfless bolvar would tell the Dearhlord it didn't matter if he lived or died that the Knights of Archerus were under his control?\n\nOr when you go to obtain Frostmourne you kill one of the spirits for forsaking the light and another for refusing to forsake it. \n\nHe specifically talk about things like not showing mercy or weakness. None of that is in line with original Bolvar because this new Lich King is being corrupted slowly,wow

244033,On that I agree. I personally don't care to see bolvar become a villain anytime soon. I would like for him to be a detached antihero which is sort of what he is in legion. Perhaps down the line he starts to disagree with our methods and conflict ensues. I'd like more to be explained in bfa but I'm not counting on it.

391633,I have a keyfob authenticator I've had since Cataclysm. I think my account had been hacked so I got my characters restored. I think I was even so paranoid as to buy new game cd's and transferred characters to my new account. I like the keyfob but I looked it up and you can replace the keyfob with a mobile authenticator. I don't think I'll do that quite yet but if you are interested you can view the webpage I was looking at here:  https://www.engadget.com/2012/03/31/how-to-replace-a-keyfob-authenticator-with-a-smartphone-battle-n/,wow

403126,Pretty much.\n\nIllidan just wanted power.  His entire story is wanting power and fuck the consequences.\n\nHe went to outland to escape KJ and what does he do?  Immediately enslave people and become a tyrant.\n\nIllidan is a one trick pony and that trick is betrayal.  Why do you think his allies always turn on him?  He betrays them.,wow
403383,Thrall is a worthless Mary Sue whose entire redeeming quality of being close to humans was thrown away by some hack writer to have an equally worthless wife and child. Everything bad that happen comes down to him being a joke. In the next expansion he deserves to have his family cut down in front of his face.,wow

407379,God I wish they'd let you go 1-80 in kalimdor and eastern kingdoms that would be perfect ,wow
407989,Maybe they're holdouts from the Bloodtotem that didn't go Fel? It does seem like many of the allied races are outliers within their own societies. ,wow

419912,Yep.  I'm definitely in the WoW community right now.,wow
420204,Most likely yup. \n\nA reminder for skeptics: New class combos HAVE been available prior to expansion release. Even Demon hunters were available prior to Legion\u2019s release. Allied races being playable as a preorder or prepatch bonus 2-3 months before release is perfectly possible,wow

439327,The ritual was performed by a Val\u2019kyr and also apparently empowered Nathanos greatly. So my guess is they turned his cousin into a death knight style undead and then moved Nathanos\u2019 soul over into it. ,wow

484371,Goblin chiropractor: well aimed missile to the spine,wow
485208,That means at least one model has been made. That does not mean that a whole set of customization options has been made.,wow

486889,Oh trust me I've done all that lol. Abandoned. Relogged. It let me further then kicked me back..,wow
487673,Can you still use the grapple points without it?,wow
488176,Nowhere did the person you responded to suggest being rude to them. They just said not to immediately defend someone if you don't know the full story.,wow
489041,He just ditched his hoodie,wow

503905,Oh so that was Baine in the BFA cinematic :O\n\nInb4 I'm late to the party and everyone already knew that,wow
504327,Who in here is defending anyone? Most seem to just encourage OP to keep playing and meet more people. If soilenders is opposed to that then he must encourage rudeness towards OP.,wow

510526,OPs mom.,wow
510873,If they could pull it off and it not seem weird or rushed then I guess? Personally I don't have a lot of faith. It would be nice for the Horde if the Horde didn't get another evil leader that we'll have to kill so I don't mind if it does go down like that.,wow
511117,Either that or someone at Blizz is sadistic af and keeps snatching hope away from us Wrathion fans,wow

512751,A dissimulation?! What are you concealing...?,wow
513006,A manshee ,wow
513132,Why not?,wow
513233,It's a pair of glasses not a santa hat or any holiday themed item.\n\nNext you'll be saying the Onyxian whelpling we got years back should be restricted to only being able to be summoned during the event.\n\nAlso we can use the toys from the events all year round we can literally wear a full santa outfit 24/7 if we wanted to using the toy. \n\n,wow

528943,I have to say this is about as true as it gets in wow. Once I went with pugs and cleared heroic night hold when it was relevant and we finished it in two hours and was the best group skill wise but then everyone was just a complete total cunt and arrogant as fuck. Then I tried a normal night hold later that week and it took 5 hours but everyone just extremely nice. Really is varied ,wow
529262,When?,wow
529460,I\u2019ve done everything except Outland and Northrend for Loremaster. I will pick this back up immediately once this goes live. ,wow
529611,Why yes I'll take an extra 100+ bag spots please thanks,wow
530368,Yes. So did I. But not so easily. And he killed his brethren already so it\u2019s super lame that they played such a huge part. He killed them EASILY and suddenly their dead selves are stronger than their living selves? Fuck that\n\n\nLet alone the fact that Sargeras made little to no appearance the whole expansion. Then \u201cpoof\u201d he\u2019s a fucking cloud? Then two seconds later it\u2019s all over?! \n\n\n*what the actual fuck*,wow

New level zone scaling would match with this perfectly.\n\nOf course there will be race changes. I really don't think many people are willing to level from lv 20 to get minor appearance change. Especially if all races are coming in BfA when there is tons of other things to do with your main.,wow

712115,Oh boy are you in for a surprise regarding the new UI!,wow
712550,I don't get why people want the authenticator really.\n\nI've played through 5 expansions in its entirety and don't understand.  Does blizzard gain information with this purchase?  They know your phone number... with that they'd know your name and location?\n\nIf it's for safety purposes... then if logging into a game forces me to purchase another measure of security then that isn't a game i'd want to play.\n\nEspecially if hacking an account is more than 50% likely which is absurd.\n\nI just don't understand honestly.  I've been reading most of these comments and its a bunch of yea it's great!  I'd pay for an authenticator and i get more stuff!  which by the way they said in the past was impossible or really hard to do due to code... and not one mention of this?\n\nIs everyone here just downvoting real people who could see through this bullshit.  \n\nI really don't understand.  My guess is this whole post is voted by paid employees and are just blinding themselves to the reality of... \n\npaying for a service that's not needed and incentivizing that service with bag space which was told was really hard to do in earlier interviews is just fucken pathetic... like blizzard really?  honestly... really?,wow

I stopped playing once I saw the direction the game was heading after LK.\n\nSo none of the raids are extremely difficult to complete? I thought 40 man raids were way too much but the 10-25 man raids from BC and WoTLK were still challenging to complete and I loved that,wow

817939,only 4 :(,wow

836670,All I\u2019m saying is that I don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing bad as assassination when I\u2019m pulling 1.2mil dps on average with 930 Ilvl and 2 piece bonus. Anyone can make any spec good.,wow

838445,World of wrinklecraft ,wow
838834,Hmmm.\n\nI liked long leveling back when we had so many different abilities because each level I had a chance at a new ability. I stood a good chance of being rewarded for every level.\n\nWith ability pruning I feel like it won't be as rewarding slowed down.,wow

848508,Is this like the Archimonde moose and it'll go away after Legion ends?,wow
848959,Yup! Just keep checking your garrison mission list whenever you can remember. It's a level 100 mission. As is the upgrade kit that turns the selifie cam into a Toy.,wow

850957,Wow!,wow
851079,&gt; The NElves stance on Arcane magic looks silly and hypocritical nowadays because there's been a bunch of changes in the story since then.\n\nAnd because you can literally be a night elf mage.  Still don't understand that particular change.,wow

854027,Stupid sexy void elves.,wow

864662,[deleted],wow
865697,I also really like the idea of dungeon scaling. If dungeons scale like zones currently do then in the 40+ range queuing for a random dungeon will be able to give you so many different dungeons. I like questing a lot but the occasional dungeon is nice too,wow
866966,well yeah it makes sense that the these races would join with the legions defeat the quests to unlock dark iron and the trolls probably won't be open until 120,wow
866974,I haven't done Netherstorm/Shadowmoon Valley since TBC. So looking forward to that. \n\nAlso I can finally finish old zones without outleveling it after 10 quests.,wow

870296,Thanks for the input. I\u2019ll probably just wait until Classic then because that\u2019s what I\u2019m truly looking for. I\u2019m hoping they will re-release BC and WoTLK from here too with the option to transfer up to those servers if you please.\n\n,wow
870672,You still get all the features of 8.0 without buying the new expansion so it is technically still Legion. It's a transitional patch. ,wow
871248,Alliance embassy on the PTR 7.3.5,wow
871530,My OCD is triggering hard with the change in order closer to the bottom...,wow
871659,Allied races are more powerful in the beginning which is why they start at level 20. Doesn't mean that in the end you can't have equal strength. The same reason hero classes starts at a higher level since they begin more powerful.,wow
871700,About sargeras body: do you remember Broxigar? Only living being (orc) that hurt Sargeras body during world of the ancients  ,wow
872468,This is 100% going to be easier. This won't include all those hidden one-off quests you had to do sometimes to get enough quests.,wow
872725,But C'thun got rekt by us in Vanilla... and now gets farmed each week by mog hunters.\n\nEdit: Do I really need to put a /s at the end of this shit?\n,wow

874364,I can't wait for someone to post a screenshot from the same spot with Argus and the inky black potion.,wow
874678,Because Alli players have been crying since 2007 that the Blood Elves are Horde and Blizz finally wants them to shut the fuck up.,wow

877448,I'm missing the highmountain and valarjar mount. Got the nightfallen and dreamweaver after 40 tries each. That's 400000 reputation... I'm wondering if they are going to adjust the drop rate since next expansion its gonna be a pita to farm these. Good luck everyone. ,wow
877649,In my post reference him being the only person to come in to contact with his full form,wow
878163,...That's what I'm saying. The only allied race he MAYBE could have gotten to was the Dark Iron dwarves.,wow
879440,they fixed female blood elf's weird model bug when sheating weapons and some other annoying model bugs since tbc,wow
880166,I'm a big picture guy. Randomly deciding to kill a bunch of injured orc crewmen I see for no other reason than they're orcs doesn't equate to conquering Outland to use it as a base to fight the Legion. ,wow

882325,Yes. I was agreeing with you.,wow

896419,&gt; IDK why Blizz decided to write Tyrande's response that way\n\nBecause Illidan has been trying to shag his brother's wife for thousands of years and Tyrande is said wife. Pretty sure the woman has her rights to find him a creep and dislike him.,wow

898454,But then Blizzard would be less likely to shut up all the people that have been crying for the past decade that Blood Elves are Horde.,wow

904932,Do we really need perfect balance though? 8d rather have relatively lore accurate races than every race class combo under the sun.,wow
905110,The dwarves?,wow
905526,[deleted],wow
906796,I have no idea how that aspect of it will work. It wouldn't surprise me if it went the way of the moose.,wow
907063,Dragon Ball taught me that you can always expand the Lore !,wow
908131,L...Loremaster Theron?,wow
908382,Huh. I mean I guess. Doesn't really fit the lore of Dark Iron Dwarves to be Paladins but sure I guess.,wow
908796,The light will... AAAAHHHHHHH,wow
909346,You think it would... But it wont.,wow
909768,If i understand what you are looking to have explained it the pressing of the spell you want to cast as your finishing a previous cast to essentially cast it as soon as possible eliminating downtime. For affliction warlock there isnt like an abundance of combos or anything that this pertains to other than Unstable affliction and if you use Elvui the time which to press is represented by a red bar on the cast bar (ita actually the latency bar for your ping but still can kinda be used for this purpose). So esentially you press the button to cast a second UA right before the end of the previous cast and it will cast it as soon as the previous is completed queue'ing up the spell casts. This also works for instant cast spells to queue up but affliction doesn't really take advantage of this as say a mage can.,wow
910264,I'd assume death knights if anything. Is paladin confirmed? ,wow
911630,[deleted],wow
911761,For... which allied race? ,wow
911783,Yeah I think it was said at blizzcon that you need to do questlines in the new BfA zones for each faction,wow
912213,The sorting of these pictures is /r/mildlyinfuriating,wow
912216,Yes? Someone called?,wow
912856,Ive done this a couple times - every time I could go back to the boat (outside org for horde &amp; Storming harbor for alliance) and asked to be taken to the phased Exodar where the pad for teleporting to argus will be. You can then carry on the quest normally,wow

944681,I use Exorsus Raid Tools to do this. I think to get it to work properly you have to be raid leader/assistant. \n\nPart of the ERT package gives you a bar with marking icons and buttons to do pull timers etc.,wow

I don't really use void storage but I really like the idea of being able to save on transmog costs.\n\nAlthough I really want to know what Entropic Embrace does. Could be cosmetic but Void Elves seem to be otherwise lacking any sort of stat boosting racial so it might be something really cool.,wow

1022752,She's always been about self preservation. She even says the Forsaken are dispensable until she realized that she needs them. So she worked on ways to make them grow instead of fizzle out.

1034680,This. Currently if questing you usually end up returning many green quests and also kill green mobs. Also you can't complete quest chain so moving to new are takes time as well.\n\nI think that after all it is not much slower than what it is now. But even if it is a little bit slower it is much more enjoyable because you can actually read quest texts now because you know you can finish story,wow

1047903,Not correct. You're thinking of the skeleton that their model is applied to. Many types of characters/creatures in WoW share skeletons. The Nightborne **models** are unique. their skeletons are not.,wow
1048619,I warned my guild not to stand under it but nooo. They didn't listen.,wow
1049476,Ill make an edit to the main post with some of my findings with my last couple hours on PTR as well as forum feedback. Couple interesting things.,wow
1049576,"Tyrande \""experimented\"" in her college days.",wow
1050769,what the fuck,wow
1050941,"This would go well with my priest \""Ludachrist\""",wow
1051085,I didn't bother with either. I just leveled alts and geared them up in arenas. First and only expansion I had more than 2 characters at max level. Think I had 6 by the time legion came out,wow
1051583, Nice I wish I lived there,wow
1051823,"\""I don't even look like that!\""",wow
1052107,wasn't this a moderate and appropriate proposition?,wow
1052367,Or Warcraft 4,wow
1052561,I mean it's Blizzard writing so you never know wtf will happen.,wow
1052749,I had multiple 99parse and I use renew sometimes,wow
1052821,You'll see Argus forever if you never complete Antorus!  :D,wow
1052826,&gt; Care for a glass of arcwine? I jumped on the berries myself.\n\nNot sure if joke.. or a flirt from someone with a foot fetish ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0),wow
1053962,I wonder if this will break rogues out of stealth.,wow
1054215,We 3 shot heroic Argus lol,wow
1054803,[deleted],wow
1056383,I don't get it,wow
1056401,Honestly that one is a tad more creepier....I prefer the other one.,wow
1056461,*For da Hoard*,wow
1056484,&gt; Tyrande still looks good after all these years. Know if she's seeing anyone,wow
1056669,My SO and I did this and now I feel like I can\u2019t ever join a guild on my main because the easy access to all our stuff is too convenient to give up. ,wow
1057315,&gt; Elf please.\n\n*race changes immediately*,wow
1058762,Just waking up from a hangover lmao and ah nice again sadly I don\u2019t think that the uk servers are compatible with the us servers,wow
1058926,So Zandalari wouldn\u2019t be possible?,wow
1059309,Get these VILE remarks out of my Christian game,wow
1059710,He keeps telling me that I'm gonna pay the same price he did someday.  He's probably just hinting at one of the many other demo reworks to come in the future.  ,wow
1061160,It was confirmed before Legion launched ,wow
1061496,Also if any one else has the same problems here you go.\n\n183820 Burning maw\n254760 Corrupting-maw\n248499 Sweeping scythe\n244016 Reality-tear\n250255 Empowered-shock-lance\n247367 Shock-lance\n247687 Sever\n254919 Forging-strike\n244899 Fiery-strike\n245518 Flashfreeze\n244291 Foe-breaker\n243431 Taeshalachs-reach\n248499 Sweeping-scythe\n244892 Exploit-weakness,wow

1061958,How do you get through the intermission immediately before this then.,wow
1062036,&gt;No posts specifically to share your transmog. Try /r/Transmogrification\n,wow
1062070,Achivements for them were in ptr,wow
1062809,New players get a free 90/100/110 who can buy heirlooms for them.,wow
1063087,Yeah ive played on quite a few vanilla servers so it takes me on average 4-5 days. For players coming from Retail servers to legacy servers who have never experienced vanilla it can easily reach 2-3 weeks played.,wow
1063115,Recently I noticed a ghostly dwarfen lady follow me around for a short while after using The Innkeeper's Daughter (toy). I've been using that damn thing for over 5 years and didn't notice it before. My mind was blown.,wow
1063359,Are you positive you have?\n\nhttps://us.battle.net/support/en/article/32229,wow
1063516,I have over 100 attempts at the blazing drake without success. I can't wait until I never have to do DS again.,wow
1064684,the model is unique for alliance players because it was unobtainable for them and has a totally unique colour. (that chickeb model was horde pvp only)  \ni don't think a saddle makes the moose special at all. I already have like 3 of them even with the same colour. the nightborn mount looks like the non epic Version of the one you got from the questline.  \nlet`s wait for the troll mount but i don't expect them to do something crazy/cool/special. imho it will be  a generic raptor with some colours and a few totems or something  \nbut ofcourse this is a thing of preference. I am Not impressed at all at the horde mounts ,wow
1064733,She's this NPC:\nhttp://www.wowhead.com/npc=107726/ethel-waterwise\n\nHer quest is a parody of old school escort quests that took forever because the NPC is walking super slow. Lot of people bitched about her quest at the beginning of Legion.,wow
1065084,Oh that looks good! When will that be live?,wow
1065279,Vore'dorei.\n\nDon't ask what their racials are,wow
1065404,It's literally just because they didn't want to add the one NPC and one or two quick quests to the two starting zones,wow
1065504,This. A common rabble nightborne would get his ass kicked in many places in Suramar that we used that illusion to access. ,wow
1065854,My biggest concern is what people will ask in every Q&amp;A from now on.,wow
1065869,I'm pretty sure the stipulation for the armor is that you have to level 20-110 to get the achievement and since a boost resets your inventory and shiz it only makes sense you wouldn't be able to the achievement that way.,wow
1066082,Almost definitely not. ,wow
1066228,You better not cause a fishening,wow
1066825,Frank?,wow
1067651,During the cinematic you can clearly see the rift between the worlds closing,wow
1067710,"And most of them suck donkey balls. \n\nJust have a look at the abomination of class design that is GW2 just in order to facilitate their \""new combat system\"". Or ESO where the class design is so bad I'm tempted to call it simply nonexistent. ",wow
1067875,wtf. why they all dark skin tones.,wow
1068056,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/6ypbr1/i_was_playing_around_with_some_toys_before_pull/\n\nThis post/gif/video. I still laugh any time I think of it.,wow
1068806,A lot of toys are objects too and they're spells. ,wow
1068959,I kinda muddled my own brain by imagining Sargeras upside down but then again in space there is no relative up and down,wow
1069346,[deleted],wow
1069385,I feel like the vibrance has been adjusted from the two pics. ,wow
1069412,oh another series about vanilla wow add it to the pile,wow
1069690,Super Wacraft Galaxy sounds like a fun platformer,wow
1070226,ETC has a terran skin in HotS fyi,wow
1070341,no they are not. look at the male. night elf males have a lot more muscles on their arms and legs.,wow
1070533,Jesus,wow
1070734,Can you keep doing Onyxia over and over? I thought you had to wait a week :o,wow
1070777,Just stay on the boss until the aoe goes away and then you can go hit the adds. Ranged is obviously preferable since they can hit the adds from the circle (maybe feral druid can too? not sure). You'll only really have 1 bad overlap that's possible so it's not too big of a deal unless you have a ton of melee. Sounds like a low DPS issue to me. What adds are you having trouble with?,wow
1070906,Prophet Sellin'\n\nProfit Selling\n\ni donu,wow
1071206,Nightborne will prob get the sabers you see in suramar,wow
1071629,They aren't going to make a massive system change like that.,wow
1072457,I dont know if you're just plain blind but the old skeletons/models have been removed in legion. if you untick that option all you get is the old textures on new models.  and the new animations are trash as well. ,wow
1072860,Fucking kek that's hilarious,wow
1073070,I thought the title was saying four more additional bags,wow
1073231,Some used to.  I recall dying a few times in Orgrimmar.,wow
1073306,Neat,wow
1073436,got the 2h sword from aggramar on nhc with my hpaly ,wow
1075488,7.3.5 could have been a raid...missed oportunity,wow
1075588,Ethel is the tauren grandma you have to escort in Highmountain. She was (by the looks of it) designed to be your stereotypical boring escort quest.,wow
1076362,[deleted],wow
1076434,I mean to be fair the Horde was a major part of the Legion's defeat. With the other part being the Alliance.,wow
1076659,Not even the Demon Hunter moderator could *see* it coming.,wow
1077141,I paid 15k for mine #worth.,wow
1077859,[deleted],wow
1078967,how did you find out? good news!,wow
1078993,BoAs have highly reduced stats and is equal to or worse than a lot of gear currently. However BoAs still give the increased exp so you really wouldnt exchange them for any other gear because youd lose the xp buff. Unless they made it so BoA gear was extremely weak and made it really hard to level in exchange for the xp increase there is no reason to ever not use BoAs. The xp increase is the issue with BoAs not the stats. It always has been the problem and always will be.,wow
1079178,The thunder ones killed us because we had to pack on the safe zone during the darkness phase and the ones you have to CC and run away from also got us because we couldn't move away from the safe zone without dying to the darkness anyway.\n\nTried to do it again this morning but literaly every group is asking for range DPS right now and refuses melees.,wow
1079181,They were fairly isolated from any interaction with the Scourge. Where was Arthas going to find any significant number of Zandalari to raise as Death Knights? ,wow
1079197,[deleted],wow
1079735,Yay! Happy friday.,wow
1079934,What is a rotation bot?,wow
1080010,[deleted],wow
1080616,you can easily join their discord servers ,wow
1080957,I'll download the addon tonight and give it a test.,wow
1081670,That would be awesome as well actually!,wow
1082061,a bot that attacks the boss for you. It's like auto attack but instead of white damage it will do everything except moving you,wow
1082357,You get 5 for each first HC of the day (so only once a day),wow
1082650,Haven't gone that far on heroic. It'll probably consist of wiping until people get the mechanic.\n\nWe're a fairly casual guild and have only had one raid day yet - I'll probably end up modifying most of the by the time we're up for Argus. :) ,wow
1083437,I got into pet battles!,wow
1083654,Oh okay just looked it up again. Last interview I saw from Wowhead they had said no update before BFA but the interview has a new note that this has since been changed and they are planning for next expansion \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb,wow
1083731,As someone who was anduins age a few years ago I can remember very well that he won't mind,wow
1084007,Thanks for defining what BoA's are. I don't even get the point of why you wrote all that. ,wow
1084464,How'd you catch a chupacabra?,wow
1084480,Same could be said for dark irons. They holed up in their mountain pretty hard for a long time. I don\u2019t think they were out and active around the time of the third war. Even post vanilla the farthest you see dark irons is the broken bridge in Arathi. It\u2019s a stretch for both tbh.,wow
1085010,[deleted],wow
1085097,nhc?,wow
1085412,And murky.,wow
1085637,Tf am I looking at? ,wow
1086593,Well... true... but I can't run around with no armour on in the end.,wow
1086997,Across vanilla and expansions i think i've done 0-current max roughly 40-50 times and im super excited for level scaling. Different strokes!,wow
1087142,Confirmed. Requeued and everything went smooth this time. :),wow
1087166,except you are wrong on that.,wow
1087533,&gt; Maybe we'll finally get to see Yrel again.\n\nMaybe blizzard will actually let us make Draenei using her horn style. ,wow
1087897,Feels bad. I hardly ever get gear from Great Invasions in Argus. This week a helm dropped for me and I decided to test my luck with a reroll. I got the same exact helm from the roll. Neither were warforged/titanforged. I feel you.,wow
1088101,That's the Innkeeper's daughter!,wow
1088177,I'm not so sure it did. Wait and see how things develop? :),wow
1088848,&gt; the model is unique for alliance players because it was unobtainable for them\n\nMagister's Terrace Kael'Thas dropped a White Chicken.,wow
1089620,What\u2019s the point of even playing then? You\u2019re essentially paying a monthly subscription to watch a movie with video game graphics,wow
1090085,No hating Matthew Mercer!,wow
1090160,normal,wow
1090387,Im basically saying that if the exp was removed from BoAs with current PTR leveling there would be no reason to use them since a lot of questing gear is equal to or better than it stat and ilvl wise. I have never seen the need for the xp increase on gear that also scales to your level honestly. ,wow

1094320,[deleted],wow
1094358,Honestly I don't remember. I would say unlock Talador. From your garrison you probably have a quest to open the hub in Talador. Build an Inn anyway unless you've gathered all the toys from another character (level III inn quests).,wow
1095168,Nothing Is set in stone yet but it wouldn\u2019t make much sense for the alliance to unlock horde races,wow
1095202,Why are there always investigative asshats on the net who freaking cares if they have 3 days of logs get a life,wow
1095254,So based on the Windrunner joke for Void elf male hopefully Vereesa isn't going to die as people were speculating.,wow
1095572,It'll probably go away for everyone once the last boss is available in LFR. Just like it was with the appearance of Argus. ,wow
1096110,They look ridiculous.,wow
1096375,thats Not the model of the void chicken.  \nthe void chicken uses  the horde only pvp chicken which you get for 100 arena wins,wow
1096889,&gt; Tyrande came off as extremely disdainful of their magic addiction.\n\nI've lost all respect for Tyrande this expansion. I actually hope she dies next expansion.\n\nMalfurion is fairly neutral. I'd be happy if they replaced both of them.,wow
1096975,Would not be surprised if they only can speak the later. The whole language restriction thing is not that great now. ,wow
1097183,[deleted],wow
1097341,That is never happened ,wow
1097836,Where can we check their emotes? edit: just realized they are on wowhead,wow
1098697,okay thx ,wow
1098971,Because you lie about using one and you do more damage than most people and it makes you feel good inside. I've met a lot of people over the years who only care about being top dps/top damage dealer in raids and that's their sole reason for playing. ,wow
1099082,okay thx ,wow
1100322,#I ANSWER TO NO ONE.,wow
1100947,I'm actually really happy about this.  My favorite skyboxes in outland and northrend aren't as enjoyable with the big green ball in the sky.,wow

1101840,D-D-DRA-DRAENOR IS F-F-FREE-EEE,wow
1102132,what,wow
1102191,I agree. Only reason I give an outside chance to the Dark Iron is because they were at least on the same continent as Arthas during the attack on Light's Hope. ,wow
1102945,We were 9/10 (m) in nh and it took us a little over 100 pulls to kill hc kj we finished the raid with 7/9 (m) (Top 2000) and are curently 8/11 in heroic (after two days)  so i dont agree with you.,wow
1103928,Unlikely. They've said that the quests to unlock Zandalari Trolls and Dark Iron Dwarves happen during the BfA questing. I doubt they'll be available during the pre-patch.,wow
1105097,I'm at 90 runs on DS and I only have the blazing drake........  Still need 12b and Lifebinders...  RNG's a bitch,wow

1109233,I noticed this whilst leveling a Paladin... the damage is crazy for ages lol\n,wow
1109307,Dungeons are significantly harder on the PTR currently. With current scaling groups of fully loomed players are still wiping somewhat regularly. At least 1 wipe per dungeon in the few I have done. Dungeon mobs have also had their stats buffed quite a bit. ,wow
1110038,That would be awesome if it happened!,wow
1110356,Are the classes set already for the new races?,wow

1113749,we had trouble with him too but after the tanks figured how to position he realy isnt hard anymore.,wow
1113916,Something else that stick out to me. If these were just things being set up for the next expansion and not 7.3.5 content then why is this stuff so we'll developed and the non legion races with little to nothing on them.,wow
1114225,Because 2+2 = 4 - 1 = 3 that's Quick Math.,wow
1114665,Cheers man! I know how hard it can be to explain in depth why you like a spec so much! ,wow

1122870,Yes.  This is obviously the final iteration of the void elves.  Nothing will happen from this point.,wow
1123170,Sure. I mean we used it on Argus mostly to avoid drying up the tree in p4. It worked well on that regard. ,wow

1125082,That's just your opinion. I love the Lightforged Draenei. Void elves seem pretty cool and people have wanted dark irons for a while.,wow
1126344,My friend farms quite a bit of transmog for his toons and he is a huge mount collector. Personally I\u2019m not the biggest collector but I quite enjoy leveling alts and trying to really delve into playing another class. Right now I\u2019m looking at all classes to main in the next expansion so that gives me something to do is work on alts. But I\u2019m really waiting for the level zone scaling to do that. ,wow

1130491,Guess it remains to be seen. I wouldn't be surprised if they make it similar to demon hunters. ,wow
1130540,FINALLY!.. Time to re-sub!,wow
1130693,I agree with restrictions to an extent. Monks are a bit thrown everywhere. Though they could forgo the dk starting zone and just have a story intro of fighting the legion and falling and being given a second chance. Then just start at org or sw like any other allied races I assume does.,wow
1131271,I worry for how many raid tiers that's going to cost us.,wow
1131492,There's plenty of mods who do that exact thing right now.,wow
1132927,Void forged the way to go. ,wow
1133548,WoD was the one that added it to the map interface for easy access though.,wow
1134752,"I \""might\"" have to reroll to alliance.",wow
1135235,Play other games.,wow

1140114,Draenei only know how to crash ships. They\u2019re like 0/6 for keeping ships fucking even afloat. ,wow
1140242,more likely a reference to the WQ in Suramar.,wow
1140739,"I feel like that's something that if you're going to write a book saying \""This is the ultimate cannon we're not going to fuck with the cannon anymore\"" and then you're going to make that a plot element you should probably actually include it in the story of the game or at the very least make mention of Ra-Den and the rest being abducted or missing or SOMETHING in that vain ",wow
1142374,Epic or the legendary one?,wow
1142668,Considering I didn\u2019t really play legion and it has like 79 mounts ,wow
1143320,Yeah because waiting for someone to stumble through the zone needing the same quest is soooooo immersive and gratifying. Honestly group quests should be soloable outside of current content because there is no guarantee those people will be around to do it. Sure maybe when the changes first come in and when they first release allied races but it's not a future proof idea and objectively a worse move.,wow
1143643,No witnesses,wow
1143788,Thats awesome! Is there any estimated time this goes live? im waiting to buy sub untill that so i can level some new toons. Since its on ptr it cant be that long right?,wow

1146160,Surely this is just an attitude adjustment from overpulling we've had for years? It can be hard to break a habit. Or were these wipes in a super cautious run?,wow
1146466,Outland? I never thought to check there. But why would Argus be visible there?,wow
1146937,Either one.,wow
1147566,There are Dark Iron paladins in Blackrock mountain.,wow
1149440,How do you set he view distance?,wow
1149517,Play a different game. ,wow
1149705,Makes me a bit curious to try out my warlock at some point.  I kept imagining him to be something like a bit more nefarious Bob the Skull from the Dresden Files.,wow
1150539,Foereaper seems to enjoy straight up demolishing unexpecting groups. Bosses are actually difficult again. Overpulling is a serious problem but if you are cautious you will be fine with trash.,wow
1150754,\u2018Aotc M\u2019 dont you mean cutting edge?,wow
1151536,Zandalari and Dark Iron are likely still in development as they're planned for release in BFA rather than in 7.3.5,wow

1159752,Do you get lower xp when killing mobs higher than your level?,wow
1159950,Fuck. I guess that's one way to sell character boosts.,wow
1160072,Do it now then?,wow
1160539,Not really because her people can still disagree and leave. They arent forced unwillingly there is a quest about it in the forsaken starting zone,wow
1160562,Do you not follow the story of the expansion at all?,wow
1161780,So would you call that a Cenarion Circle Jerk?,wow
1162028,just have fixed positions theresno need to move in that fight.,wow
1162190,I think its Alleria. In her recently datamined stuff she says some things that fit the bill. And she's now entangled with the void.,wow
1162488,Urge to roll a void elf rising.,wow
1162864,Not all those who bargain are poor,wow
1162947,The men were asleep in the Emerald Dream for ten thousand years. No doubt lesbianism must\u2019ve become somewhat common after a few centuries of frustration.,wow
1162984,Yup that may well explain the delay in pre-orders. Could well include access to some sub races. I think it's a really good idea. Gives everyone something else to do whilst waiting for 8.0 and makes best use of the scaling. Also explains why scaling wasn't held back for 8.0.,wow
1163409,[Regi](https://www.jobat.be/uploadedImages/pictures/regi-penxten-14.jpg) you say?,wow
1164040,How does ElvUI cost money?,wow
1164299,And a boost (assuming) so I don't have to level a Goblin Priest.,wow
1164391,Damn wiah i had illidan i have all the other EoW funkos,wow
1164705,They wouldn't be in this build if they weren't going to be part of it in live. They'd be in the 8.0 alpha.,wow
1164961,Then wait for the patch to come out that fixes this?,wow
1165002,You just need to have your phone on you so you can click 'yes' on the app when he logs in,wow
1165887,If this ever happens I'm totally getting one of those demonic moose Tauren from Highmountain as a pet.,wow
1166318,Sylvanas' comments were way more derogatory I'm pretty sure. She basically called them cannon fodder,wow
1166825,http://i.imgur.com/MkSNRXA.jpg,wow
1167053,I'm gonna place my bets on Sylvanas trying to kill both (like she did in war crimes). Vareesa doesn't survive and that's what sets off the war.,wow
1167375,A more intelligent idea has rarely been thought.,wow
1167871,Pandas and Demon Hunters can already. ,wow
1167902,Always jump after you've blinked on top of an elevator. Never trust the blink!,wow
1168599,I think it was TidyPlates,wow
1169115,Especially since there's no way that hordies don't know common with how many people we've had to talk to this expac that were alliance aligned races. I doubt Khadgar or anyone else is going to speak orcish for our benefit.,wow
1169233,I don't understand why the spirit healers aren't fed up with us yet,wow
1170011,Yea. Every time I see these posts where loremaster gets even easier I cry a little on the inside thinking about how many more quests I did for it...,wow
1170312,Another MVP of this thread,wow
1170813,I think Quartz does something like that. If it does then you can disable those buffs from /quartz,wow
1171647,I think its quarts/quartz\nThe cast bars addon. ,wow
1171717,unless the titan dying isn't relevant to their void magic. It isn't like we have necromancy or any undead walking around in the warcraft universe. :D,wow

1175172,Void chicken and a war painted moose?\n\nLooks like I better start saving up for some race changes then!,wow
1175246,I don\u2019t see why that would change.,wow
1175625,Imagine the frustration when the males woke up though. Suddenly no one knows where the clitoris is.,wow
1177560,I wonder if the mount borrows the Highmountain's horns or if it's the other way around.\n\n/deepshowerthoughts,wow
1178603,Rocky and Bullwinkle,wow
1178745,WoD moose is a flying mount tho,wow
1179192,Fuck I'd love to stay human form on my worgen character. Or just give the gilnean voices to human characters.,wow
1179584,Nice! I guess this is in part due to the fact that you can't overlevel things anymore? Similar to how Broken Shore dungeons can have a 101 and a 110 in the same party and they do seemingly equal DPS? ,wow
1180803,Soon to be 4 Druid races,wow
1180811,That Saurfang standing up straight. We movie now bois,wow
1181718,I made so much garrison gold I just bought all the mythic raid mounts. ,wow
1182380,Slooow down.  Maffs is to be savoured!,wow
1182444,i\u00b4d speculate that you need army of the light on exalted for lightforged draenei. making half the unlocking dependent on your account (reputation with faction) and half of it on the character (actual questchain unlocking the sub race) does not sound so likely to me. so my money is on you having to grind the reputation on an ally char.,wow
1182783,and Vol'jin's urn,wow
1182876,saurfang lookes fucking amazing,wow
1182881,They should be but Ion said in the QA that they will not be dinos :(,wow
1183821,Probably due to quest scaling so people can actually explore and experience the world. ,wow
1183954,Gotta sell more character boosts \ud83d\udca9,wow
1183980,I would love cruising down the street in a mining cart tho ,wow
1184159,The only reason these achievements (or feats of strength) did not follow the usual pattern is because they were not available from the start of the raid tier.,wow
1184600,Ive been using elvui for the past 5 years i think. It doesnt costs money,wow

1189046,Good for you..,wow
1189936,Interesting.  Definitely going to wait till 7.3.5 to level another character then since it seems to even things out nicely.,wow
1190061,I have to say the datamining of Void Elfs really peaked my interest in them.  Only really cared for Zandalari Trolls and non-hunched Orcs.,wow
1190790,Proof? Watched it like million times...,wow
1191250,They are BfA specific races that require you to do a quest chain in zandalari to unlock them. We won\u2019t know more about them for a while ,wow
1191815,It has a cast time like the quest NPCs,wow
1192031,"We already have an answered to that in the ptr.These \"" Void Elves\"" arent exactly new and they are mostly consist of people dabbling with Darkhan Drathir's books for power which is already considered a huge ass taboo to the elves now after what the bastard did for power in Warcraft 3.

1200852,"Hello I just wanted to point out that it is strange that both Anduin and Sylvanas are smiling when Anduin yelled out \""For the Alliance.\"" It seems really strange that both him and Sylvanas would be make contact with one another and smile.

1217460,Then you're on a wrong website. https://www.tukui.org/download.php?ui=elvui,wow
1218180,I think the point of the scaling is that there are no mobs higher than your level unless you skip to a zone with a higher minimum level than your current level.  I would be interested to know though if leapfrogging a little bit (say going to a zone that opens up at 35 when at 33) is even remotely worthwhile in terms of XP gain.,wow
1218261,I already have 13 110s. Next xpac I'll need another 6 PLUS a 110 boost that won't get used. What do,wow

1288221,While I agree with you for the most part I could see Blizzard allowing Zandalari to be Death Knights as there have been Zandalari present in both EK and Northrend while Arthas was about. Worgen Death Knights are explained by saying they were under Arugals control in Silverpine so it's not impossible they explain Zandalari in a similar fashion just for gameplay reasons.,wow

1296887,He wants you to play feral I guess,wow
1297397,Definitely agree. I think there should either be set spawn points for the safe zones during the storm or give the players maybe 2 seconds to react and find a safe zone before the storm hits for like 1 mil a second. You can play perfectly in that fight and still die because a safe zone didn't spawn within 2 steps of you.,wow

1302889,&gt; Say what you will about the tenets of the Void. At least it's an ethos!\n\nO_O\n\nWas not expecting a Big Lebowski reference. I like.,wow
1302964,Heroic Coven is significantly easier if you bring 3 tanks and have at least 1 paladin in the group.  Basically only 2 of the sisters need a tank swap (the fire and ice ones) but the trick is a paladin can BoF off the ice tank swap debuff so you shouldn't ever need to tank swap for it.  So basically you have you just put 2 tanks of the fire sister for the whole fight swapping back and forth and just tank the other add on the other side of the room.\n\nThis significantly raises the raids dps since you are no longer running them next to each other or forcing the melee to chase them every few seconds.,wow

1325376,Why not make it so heirlooms MAKE that difference and you have to earn them? Players that played the expac a fuckton get to level fast and new players get the expierience... why slow down 1-59 and not 1-110? It is just inconsistent and people with a good income will just buy boosts from now on.\n\nI for one like leveling but just going ahead and increasing the xp you need to grind through year old content is super meh. If they rework some areas and the fact that you now always have optimal quest rewards end up making no difference when looking at time invested they can go ahead.\n\nBut simply looking at the numbers: Leveling through dungeon spamming always yielded optimal exp and now they make you girnd 60% more of that.

1367139,hello! Wanted to post my logs for my guilds first night on normal Antorus. We're not super hardcore like some other guilds out there but I try to perform my best. Some bosses might be low because of death during the encounter but I was up most of the time. \n\nhttps://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Hn7pX2NfhVD9r8vA/\n\nI wanted to see if anyone could give me tips on what I should be doing more of or less of. And is it true that my parse is heavily reliant on how long the boss fight goes for? Since my meta burst is insane but if we take longer to take them down I fall off.,wow

1374421,Weakaura has very easy to setup cooldown icons now with the templates you can select,wow
1374825,why is it funny tho ? cos their rotation is simple ?  that joke is made already above about BM hunters,wow
1374930,This is sort of i the game oh just need to follow the appropriate zones. Trolls are tough because they sort of have a gap. But the undead or night elf story lines that are currently 1-40ish should now take you 1-60 since you can't outlevel zones. ,wow
1375536,Spoiler tag doe.,wow
1375672,Not to mention duskwood has always been rather slim as far as content goes. Redridge being there meant that duskwood was really only needed for 25-30.,wow
1375915,The option is there. It's a boost you can buy. Just because you've levelled through content before you shouldn't get a free/faster pass the next time. That's not how games work or how they should work. ,wow

1382210,Did they show the Nightborne acting contrite for abandoning the Night Elves ? Easy to show compassion and understanding when you're not the wronged.\n\n&gt;Remember the Orcs were enslaved by the demon blood and had to deal with that corrupting their race too.\n\nHow have they dealt with that ?

1396566,Well its hard to fight back against an entire race when you're already so few.,wow
1397129,One thing that jumps out to me from your worldbreaker parse is a lot of wasted fury. I think you wasted over 300 fury for the fight. The best way to avoid this is to only cast Felblade when you need to (depending on gear/haste levels this may be when you're below 60-70 fury). It's going to change next tier but with the CB build we're running in T20 there's very little excuse for wasting fury.,wow

1441982,They have said that the leveling experience isn't necessary to reach max level anymore. They think the leveling experience is not necessary to get a max level character. They want the leveling experience to be something you do because you want to do it. They want you to buy boosts when you feel like you need a max level character. ,wow

1452464,Exactly my point. Winning by any means necessary in a life or death situation is one thing (a guy pulls a knife on you in a dark alley so it's ok to kick him in the balls to get away). But when it's a game and you cheat why are you playing in the first place? ,wow

It\u2019s not too bad to get up to the cap wether you want to use he boost or not but there is a lot of lore to catch up on if you\u2019re into that sort of thing. I personally was happy about it and was even more hyped after the BFA trailer. The way the game is now I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s too tough to come back but things have changed a lot since wrath. I play as a Prot pally but I feel they simplified a lot of things for a lot of classes. I like the changes for the most part but it\u2019s gonna be at your own discretion because everyone has different opinions regarding the matter I\u2019m sure.

1715935,Pick race first then pick a class they can play that will fill the roles you want. This will create and attachment to the character especially if you take your time leveling. Personally right now I'm leveling a druid following all the belt zones. I plan to join a p60 and p70 guild along the way to fully experience that content for 3-4 months. ,wow

1718759,Stepping into a battleground definitely  proves this nowadays. Alliance get fucking trounced in every one I have been in in legion. ,wow
1719454,What about Liadrin? Not to mention that there are likely a ton of Blood Elven Demon Hunters who while more neutral- are sorta joining the Horde afterwards.,wow

Imo ee is just better even if youre not using it perfectly efficently just because of the flexability it provides.

1728591,Its so bullshit too. Im an alliance main. NOONE would have complained if Vol Jin survived. Since Varian had his time to shine and had Anduin while Vol Jin still had much of his story left. Lets hope this is just temporary and he gets a big role as a loa,wow

1754643,You are right. Yet Azeroth is spherical. It is not impossible that N'zoth was freed since it would be strange to let C'thun reappear imo,wow

1761049,Thank you! I agree :D,wow
1761577,I've gotta say I'm so excited for the Nightborne.  I played Forsaken before race changing to BElf just because BElf made more sense and had a crazier story but now I've played through Suramar twice and LOVE the story and the design.  Ideally you'll be able to race change to Allied factions.  I have chieves and items since Vanilla on my mage and don't want a new toon. :),wow

1766602,you aren't seriously keybinding an rp spell. That's just silly.,wow
1767035,You can't sim. What you can do is look at logs and see just how much hps everything adds in. Given enough sample size you get a good idea of what's what. Which is exactly what the good people of shaman discord have done. They have lists for the trinket on their spreadsheet.\n\nTldr: new Argus Lego &gt; velens &gt; Argus epic trinket boosted a good amount &gt; dgd &gt; seastar &gt; everything else,wow

1829947,Wow this is great!! I love the pose and the way you made the scales :),wow
1830023,[deleted],wow
1831493,Thank you very much! &lt;3,wow
1831596,It was never confirmed that the Horde burned it down though.\n\nSeems to me like Genn's personal war more than anything.,wow

1835290,What's your cat doing right now?,wow
1835655,If you do it on an alt it still counts towards the achievement ,wow
1837898,Didn't Jaina desert the Alliance because Anduin wouldn't go to war with the Horde? lol,wow
1839082,Gorgrond trick?,wow
1839162,One of the most uninteresting character in game even though he had the most character development out of any. ,wow
1840005,Just fuck me up now.,wow
1840009,[How do you figure](https://i.imgur.com/vdTx8S6.jpg),wow
1840102,I think it was just model reuse. Those things probably are some sort of representation of Argus's corruption.,wow
1840601,Wish they would fix classes or at least the goddamn tier sets.,wow
1841487,You may have enabled v-sync in the Nvidia control panel inadvertently.,wow
1841496,[deleted],wow
1841962,The Lich King was created by Legion.,wow
1842643,FOR THE HORDE! :-D,wow
1843815,The closest thing would be an Orc riding a Gronnling,wow
1844240,Maybe it fires octagons? ,wow
1844410,Just play a void elf on moonguard and you'll be all set!,wow
1844873,/r/2healthbars,wow
1845012,So rolling a void elf caster.,wow
1845339,Surely Blizzard could make the voice actors doing the playable Nightborne to record an extra line just for the racial? Then everyone can hear it. Loudly.,wow
1845458,Dope! First the horde get shite allied races and now shite mounts to match. So excited ,wow
1846095,Yeah wtf! Is there just no moose antlered balance form?,wow
1846180,5/7,wow
1846359,Teldrassil looks fire now \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc4c,wow
1847190,Yeah that's my understanding but I could be wrong.,wow
1847406,Probably moreso. Caster rotations in general have moved away from just spamming one spell and are more involved.,wow
1847608,Havent you been paying attention?  The christians have been warning about how the 2nd one is coming!  For..i dont know..centuries.\n\nWhere were you when the first snowmen fell?,wow
1848068,[removed],wow
1848549,110 levels and they want to increase the time it takes to reach max level?? Why not just remove heirlooms?\n\nReally?,wow
1848635,I mean their cute together ^^^^^^^^uwu,wow
1850303,And are you ignoring the fact that both High Mountain and Zandalari are getting druids? With neither of the alliance races getting druids? Leaving our options still to Night Elf and Worgen alone. \n\nFactions will never be balanced. Horde will always have more shaman race choices and alliance will always have more paladin race choices. ,wow
1851079,But the Armory app does.  \nSo it's a mistake from the developers of the Legion app...,wow
1851291,Do quests scale as well? because the problem is not in the mobs but in quests. PTR is not avalable in my region and i posted from what i saw and read on the forums.,wow
1852503,Cautiously optimistic they'll be released for either 7.3.5 or the prepatch period before BfA.,wow
1852908,"Thats the whole point.  Sylvanas leadership is based on misunderstandings. First she led alliance to believe that she abandoned them on BS then it looks like she led alliance to believe she burned the tree. Alliance is like \""fuck this shit lets take her city.\""",wow
1853211,Thank you. I'd not run into it before. ,wow
1853708,If you gave a cow antlers instead of horns it's a cow with antlers not a moose. It's the same principle lol,wow
1853934,This,wow
1853959,This man doesn't represent the horde,wow
1855401,I wonder how this affects farming and stuff? Surely you can still get there. ,wow
1855622,Keep in contact with Blizzard. Keep trying.,wow
1856870,&gt;your fun is wrong because I don't like it!,wow
1858069,No better one is ramsteins lighting bolts. I used it from lvl 48 to 90. it hits everyone for 5.8 k minimum and crust for 11k. Pull a lot of mobs and almost one shot everything ,wow
1858121,I don't understand how its so complicated to understand what I am saying. It was done by someone to make it seem like horde did it to start a faction war,wow
1859561,Thank you.,wow
1859983,Of course I finish my loremaster achievement one week before seeing this lol fml,wow
1860294,Top notch datamining. ,wow
1860596,They certainly are!,wow
1861235,Are you 110?,wow
1861631,Yes,wow
1862323,Or just level up one opposite faction toon for the story,wow
1863687,The best part? it leaves a little pile of meat for each person it kills. It is amazing!,wow
1864726,I wouldn't hate that. Theoretically anything that can be a priest and warrior should be able to be a pally right? ,wow
1864830,"They empower your weapon to unlock more traits in your class hall. I believe wowhead has a \""returning player guide\"" that may benefit you greatly. ",wow
1864972,How far into Suramar are you? I know that plays a part of BoP. \n\nAnd I think you need Azuna up to Atleast the blue dragon flight done. ,wow
1865321,This really explains how disinterested he seems within the alliance embassy,wow
1865704,she looks more manly than Anduin tbh which is just fine with me,wow
1866147,You can *kind of* get a white horse mount like that from the Argent Tournament if you're Horde: \n\nhttp://www.warcraftmounts.com/mounts/whiteskeletalwarhorse.php,wow
1866312,Actually I almost completely skipped Suramar...,wow
1866378,the rogues and druids will support you 100%,wow
1867031,Just wait until he brings doom upon all of azeroth,wow
1867155,I never said it has affected me at all. I just think it's too much. It's fine if you disagree.,wow

1869338,What's your schedule like? I play Friday and Saturday late night. Past 10pm PST. Send me a message if you play during those hours so we can group up.,wow
1869412,Maybe it being a 1-60 heirloom with an ilvl of 560?(completely serious i have no idea)\n\n\nIf that is the case it\u2019s because it scales to show you in the heirloom tab,wow
1871041,It\u2019s not upgraded so it doesn\u2019t scale ,wow
1871166,Do you know that this is a subreddit for the game World of Warcraft?,wow
1871531,That might be it. To finish BoP you have to finish suramar + insurrection or whatever the follow up is called. ,wow
1871750,[deleted],wow
1871817,The method for appeals would have been detailed in the email you received informing you of the account action.\n\nYou can continue to appeal until such a time that Blizzard informs you no further appeals will be accepted.\n\nEach appeal is reviewed by a different person.  Appeals are a request for them to review the evidence against you again.  It is not a chance for you to plead your case.,wow
1872196,Ok thanks!,wow
1872781,~grabs a bucket of popcorn~,wow
1872887,That look you give when you're about to screw millions without net neutrality ,wow
1873084,i jsut said that,wow
1873106,I hope they add a \u201cTeldrassil Burning Filter.\u201d,wow
1873329,There was a rather big banwave yesterday targeting rotation bots.\n\nIf you're really innocent give them a call or send a ban appeal.,wow
1873603,Well yeah because fuck the Alliance anyways.,wow
1874101,Can these guys be paladins? Cuz I'm seeing prot racials.,wow
1874220,Now we need the Stimp'dorei,wow
1874361,I just hit up elemental with the new antorus legendary ring and already doing dps not far off - with a 841 fist of ra den\n\nI guess Elemental just fits me better,wow
1875566,But did it have an axe?,wow
1875647,Wonder if that crater is her \u2018heart\u2019 that has been filled,wow
1875930,Eonar is fun as long as it does t feel tedious IMO,wow
1876127,Did BLIZZARD say a reason why Cata/MoP can't lvl 80 to 100? I really want to skip WoD,wow
1876257,Just checked and made sure it was off however my frames still won't budge... ,wow

1879276,got'em,wow
1879652,Needs spikes ,wow
1880228,So this was just a common Greece fire? ^^sorry,wow
1880264,I started a new tauren last night and the mountain thunder bluff is on isnt very pretty. It looks like someone took some flat land and dragged the scale to 100% vertical and called it a day. It looked fine 10 years ago but that could use an update too.,wow
1880920,because they go by 2's.\n\nI imagine one day WoD and Legion will be combined.,wow
1882027,They have already told me that they won't review it after the first time i contacted them. I just called and they are going to escalate it but I doubt they even care. I am beyond frustrated with this company. ,wow
1882483,Like others have said racials don\u2019t really\nMatter anymore \n\nAs for pvp I believe the human racial stacks with the trinket while the gnome racial doesn\u2019t. ,wow
1882782,Im also feeling like im not even Dpsing that much higher then with the old 4 piece. Mythic plus is kind of another playstile too and i dont like it at all.,wow
1883109,You didn\u2019t do madness of death wing then in Cata.  \n\nYou spent 500+ pulls killing heroic spine then literally 1 shot madness because it was such a joke by the time you got to it.,wow
1883599,I had to see if I was on the LoL reddit for a second with you here..\nAlso how's the collection going of those pics?,wow
1883776,The boy-king serves at Greymane's table. Three lies he will tell you.,wow

1886168,This is why I nerdscreamed when I got the Jaraxxus toy. Who cares about temporary gear? JARAXXUS BABY!,wow
1886473,Yah I just need to do all the quests again I'm at 41/42 on my hunter and all my other toons say 0/42,wow
1886656,I wouldnt complain..,wow
1886728,Everyone\u2019s talking about this casting ability meanwhile the selling point on me for emo elves is that half off tmog,wow
1887089,There\u2019s no way these rotation bots can take into account \u201cevery variable available\u201d in a mythic raid. Does anyone have information on how good they actually are in a real setting like that?,wow
1887145,Don't think it would be preorder related. I'm guessing the patch will drop around late Feb and by allowing nightborne and highmountain to be playable they'll extend the life of Legion til BFA comes out. At the very least it'll give something for players to do. Highmountain and Nightborne have been relevant in Legion.,wow
1887227,It's showing a sword when it's filtered for resto shamans,wow
1887748,This was a protest.  I just don't know exactly what they protesting or why they decided to burn down a Christmas tree for it.,wow
1888751,You cant even see argus in outlands,wow
1888770,I know it sounds stupid but this happens a lot. Is your monitor plugged into your graphics card?,wow

1889397,I love being a mage main...,wow
1889405,Are you using a keyboard that can do recorded macros our multiple actions from a single key press?,wow
1889652,Yeah but what is the line?,wow
1889764,It worked at 110 at the start of legion to. Because for some reason the active scaled with your equipped ilvl and not the trinkets.,wow
1889989,Does that work for their real ID name as well?,wow
1890044,Because you could say that about 5 characters already.,wow
1890297,its obvious teldrassil is going to be burnt down after as retaliation because theres more horde players and they cant have the majority looking like the main bad guys but the alliance will only have attacked because of what sylvanas did to gilneas  ,wow
1890399,The boy-king serves at his master's table.,wow
1890594,For a moment I thought you said the Horde are fanatic muslims because they did this too (Belgium 2016).,wow
1890949,nope Anduin mentions it being ours in some datamined text,wow
1892346,But Horde cant speak common! .... /s\n\nCompletely stupid. Even Alliance shamans or mages should have been able to see what happened with some sort of vision into the past. Lets not forget that there is no way they dont have ambassadors talking between the factions.,wow
1892420,[deleted],wow
1892886,Pretty sure the questline to get the Manasaber is still rep gated.,wow

1893717,If you have A Glorious Campaign.,wow
1894016,I want her to be a raid boss,wow
1894813,Still in your wallet! Get to it already!,wow
1895447,Oh sweet thanks! Also do you think the survivability issue is going to be a possibility on the class ever being benched in mythic or could it be patched up by taking a hit to my DPS by dropping EoTN/SotF in exchange for Prydaz?,wow
1895751,See Baine is what we call on the farm a breeding bull...,wow
1896155,"If activating that racial doesn't automatically make your character say \""An illusion! What are you hiding!?\"" then I will be disappoint.",wow
1896229,Lmao I\u2019m still going I got a beefed up tall boy as in it has extra alcohol so I\u2019m feelin good and nice I\u2019m smokin some 27s,wow
1896604,"sylvanas is still all for war against the alliance. What happens at teldrassil we do not know but the fact is she would attack at them at some point. \n\n\nI also have to argue against the whole \""her city thing\"" forsaken may view it as their city but most alliance sees it as the reclaiming of lordaeron.",wow
1898251,Considering how ticked ally is that horse gets two shaman races over our one paladin race when horde already has significantly more combos. That would not go over well\n\nEdit: phone put horse not horde. I\u2019m leaving it,wow
1898638,Bosses don't give any extra experience over any other elite mob of the same level.,wow
1898893,Congrats btw,wow
1899012,Take my upvote and go away!,wow
1899292,Same here\n\nI was under it on tuesday and last night about 8 of us were killed,wow
1899357,Yes. :p I haven't messed with any of the cords since I had 120+ fps before,wow
1899396,Many of the voice lines for lightforged draenei for joke and flirt are vindicar related. I wouldn't bet on them being draenor draenei.  I guess maybe they could b e draenor draenei that moved to the vindicar when they joined the faction though. ,wow
1899443,This is a post about rotation bit users being banned. \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14,wow
1899676,you mean the insurrection questline? ,wow
1899924,Haha sure sounds like it. I remember the class Hall and artifact well where I can spend my points but I may have never spent any yet...maybe ,wow
1900322,TFW you burn down a city and successfully defend your own.,wow
1901667,Northrend opens up for me at level 70 right? ,wow
1901837,most have an option between pure patchwerk and an option to do normal rotation and burst on button press. ,wow
1902001,He that\u2019s also OP as fuck.,wow
1902014,Which section of Orgrimmar is that in? ,wow
1902269,Frostmourne filter? hmmm,wow
1902493,Okay this was pretty funny. ,wow
1902795,Yeah I considered adding it but this got very long even without it :D,wow
1902875,Something something bell something ,wow
1902953,That little upside-down hearth belongs to the alliance. Not your filthy horde\u2019s pale bottom!! ,wow
1903526,So basically anyone who's gotten the Faction Rep mount from HM already has their racial mount? Looks exactly the same.,wow
1904358,I like the new race but where are there even void elves? Are they on argus or something? I don't get it ,wow
1904629,Kind of sounds like your gpu is dying. Do you have another card you can test with?,wow
1904985,I did not use drums. I used agi flasks and the bear tartar (food) that increases your move speed after a kill. I highly highly recommend the food at the very least. Its dirt cheap on the auction house and helps a great amount considering how much you have to move during the challenge.,wow
1905737,It could have flavor and be actually interesting. Like have a teleport to a special Nightborne only area in Suramar. Be able to look like a mana crazed Nightborne for a few minutes. Maybe a new animation that plays while they are crafting inscriptions.\n\n+15 to a profession or 1% damage is just a throw away stat and doesn't get anybody excited.,wow
1906496,Comments like this one keep me motivated! Thanks :),wow
1906672,Don't join a guild that randomly sends you an invite. A lot of guilds send auto invites with auto messages to players who aren't in guilds so that they can fill up spots. I find that those guilds aren't always the greatest. It takes longer but the better guilds are often found through meeting helpful players while playing. If you find someone helpful or enjoyable to play with then ask if their guild is recruiting.,wow
1907142,I swear back in the old days the elevator in Undercity would crush you too.,wow
1907292,That's totally fair! It was just a neat thing that always stood out to me from when I read the Arthas novel when it came out (but I'm a pretty big Kael'thas fanboy so what can I say?),wow
1907815,Yes?,wow

1910607,We don't know.  ,wow
1910828,Why a 10% chance? Don't you want 100%?,wow
1911431,We two shot Argus Heroic and almost one shot it.\n\nThe death resurrection mechanic is way too forgiving.,wow
1911468,Is there still unmentioned allied races? Or was upright orc a troll? :(,wow
1911969,I wish we could as well. A Protection Paladin with moose antlers would be so freaking cool. I was honestly disappointed that they can't be Paladins.,wow
1912043,"\""10 lbs Bicep curls are easy.\""\n\n\""5 lbs Bicep curls are easier.\"" =! \""10 Bicep curls are hard.\""\n\nThat's as ELI5 as I can get.",wow
1912364,Usually around 75+ maelstrom. Don't want to risk wasting maelstrom if I get multiple boot procs in a row.,wow
1912430,It's basically an xp bar for your neck.  Don't think too hard about it.,wow
1912469,&gt; It serves the user far more than Blizzard.\n\nIt actually serves Blizzard a lot.  \nI'd bet they get **lots** of CC calls for hacked accounts...,wow
1912654,That's weird because I think the one before Antoran High Command doesn't squish you,wow
1913202,Wow does a good job of explaining features as they open up to you. Once you hit level 10 you should've received a message about picking a spec. Once you hit lvl 15 another one about talents will open up.,wow
1913547,I want that space ostrich.,wow
1913702,Hmm thought you needed insurrection (which I thought you needed to finish surmar) \n\nGood to know. \n\nAlthough I\u2019d never do BoP again fuk dat,wow
1914609,Yeah.,wow
1914885,&gt; it won't affect anything at max level.\n\nGoooooood.,wow
1914891,Engineering getting something decent and functional? No way.\n\nThey'd get the tram system that only travels 5 feet and its on a 3 month cooldown.,wow
1915234,Is there any super low drop item that could be farmed with mobs that drop sumptous fur or something of that nature??,wow
1916127,whats the deal with homework? you're not working on your home!,wow
1916177,we had 27? people and 5 got an epic trinket. ,wow
1916226,Especially considering we\u2019ll be on this for 8-12 months.,wow
1916703,So many alliance fan boys blindly blaming the tree burning on the horde holy shit its almost comical,wow

1917466,The ultimate spriest class fantasy,wow

1921030,[deleted],wow
1921839,this cracked me up,wow
1922039,It\u2019s not hard to program it to watch for the same windows if opportunity you\u2019re watching for.  There\u2019s nothing special about what you in particular see that let\u2019s you react.  The bot can see the same exact things and react exactly the same.  It\u2019s no different then using rotation builders to watch for an exact set of conditions and displaying the next ability you should use.  The only difference is it\u2019s actually hitting the button as well.,wow
1923035,It only plays sound files on your own PC.,wow
1923210,No.,wow
1923304,Damn. I suppose hoping for racial variants available to the opposite faction is too much.,wow
1924195,I'd gladly level another paladin if Zandalari Trolls get pally as a class. Hate how Tauren pallies look. ,wow
1924239,Im Hunter. Do I need to do the hunter campaign too? Or is that saparate for the order hall campaign?,wow
1926252,Agreed. But I guess the one problem with them coming out sooner is the possibility the allied races (lore wise) will joining BECAUSE of the events of BFA.,wow
1928116,It doesn't matter if that's true because the alliance would have no way of knowing that when it happened.,wow
1928474,Which still counts as a simple form of automation and would get you banned if you got busted and Blizzard decided to play hardball.,wow
1928695,I'm rolling Malkavian. ,wow
1929494,Bingo!,wow
1931327,Oh boy! That would be a great twist  if that happened,wow
1931601,You have to remember that these bot are only using your abilities.  You\u2019re still moving your character.  There\u2019s not that many variables that changes when an ability is used and you can go to any class guide to get a list of all those variables.,wow
1932399,You filthy alliance types picking ghosts with wings over your horde allies is what sabotaged the alliance between our factions. Also Genn's small penis. ,wow
1932580,What's your source stating for a fact that the horde did it? ,wow
1932739,I'm just hoping one of these new allied alliance races can be druids. The horde are getting 2 new druid races whereas alliance are still stuck with night elf and worgen.,wow
1933863,I know my GM has like 400-500 days on his main. ,wow
1934495,Wish the bowl and milk could leap 20 yards too :(,wow
1935733,Zandalari Druids. For sure. If not that then a Nightborne Mage,wow
1935757,Hey now! We made up for that! We even killed his kidnapper! Twice!,wow
1935833,Probably cause it\u2019d get super old,wow
1936022,Dude this is the entire point of what I am trying to say. Everyone is automatically putting the blame on the Horde when Horde leaders would never let Sylvanas go through with something like that. Alliance leaders can think it was the Horde sure but does not mean the Horde actually did it.,wow

1941179,My GPU is brand new though &gt;.&lt; I only bought it a couple of months ago so I'm thinking there's a setting somewhere I've capped it at 60 as it's the same in other games with much lower requirements  (minecraft),wow
1941390,I love the tiny horns on the cat. They look stupid and ridiculous and I love them.,wow
1941552,more than likely this or to go fight the void and slow them down. we know that the vinidcaar survives until we face the void lords considering it is the command ship of anduin.,wow
1941856,[deleted],wow
1942638,We need to be given options to easily scale xp gain. Go into a menu on a toon and just select a scale from 0 to 1 on how much we want to slow the gain for our own purpose.\n\nI also wish I could replay quests.,wow
1942763,I dont mind it. ,wow
1945866,Yeah they definitely simplified things a lot. I personally like it because there used to be too many skills and honestly I never used most of them but now a lot of skills are still there whether you see them or not but a lot at passive abilities or proc based which is nice. ,wow
1946474,I feel this way as well. I really like most dungeons even if they aren't super quick. So I'm willing to take my time in them. If I wanted to speed level I'd roll a tank so I could solo the whole thing anyway. If I'm healing or DPS speed doesn't really matter.,wow
1947553,Powah!,wow
1948079,Have a upvote mate,wow
1948446,Well if you already checked nvidia and in game settings there's nothing really left. I know it's a new gpu but it happens all the time. I went through 2 1080s when in the first 2 months when I built mine this year. Another suggestion would be to keep an eye on your cpu temps. Is this problem permanent or does it start at high fps then drop down? ,wow

1953148,This seems like the wrong fucking direction. The levelling process was boring and bad. Now it\u2019s going to take even longer to level? That fixes the problem? Sounds like a good way to make those $60 character boosts seem more appealing. Fuck that. 120 levels next xpac and they\u2019re increasing the time it takes get through the slowest most tedious part of the game. ,wow
1954096,Everyone is misunderstanding what happens in the cinematic. The Cloud literally is Sargeras. Sargeras wasn't physicslly manifested but the seat of the pantheon made him emerge too soon. This didnt make his entire body manifest however. So the reasoning is that his hand is not manifested yet so its just a cloud. My evidence is when he is being pulled away from Azeroth and is trying to grab the vindicaar. His legs are still gaseous.\n\nAlso it was over the ocean so if I'm wrong. It wouldnt have affected land mass. He didnt slam his hand on the ocean really. All of his force went into the jab.,wow
1955411,That moment when you compare the size of suramar and silvermoon...\n,wow

1958880,yeah. that is what happens when you let it be designed by a goblin. they go the cheap route of what you ask for. you ask for defensive spikes and they gave you shitty ones but they are there. proper ones would be smaller and a few bigger ones with a bunch of smaller ones on them.,wow

1966282,Although drums would definitely help a lot in the 2nd phase. Its hard to say when but if i could suggest...i would say any time you could chain stun kruul with orbs. You can surprisingly dps him down sort of easy if you can focus every GCD on damage abilities rather than stuns or move speed or incapacitates. I hope that helps : o,wow

1972991,i dont get it?\nyou realize its better to interrupt later in the cast right? less auto attacks coming from the boss that way,wow
1972996,Same way holy and shadow priests get along. They just accept that the other force is equally important for the existence of life and leave them be.,wow

1983629,I think they need to lower experience from dungeon completions. If anyone did the project 60/70s it was far superior to just spam complete the same dungeons over and over to level. Like 50-60 you spam BRD and can get a level every 15 mins and then 60-70 you can just spam BF and mana tombs for a similar speed.,wow

2000484,I'm going to assume they want new players to see more of the game. If you spend 1/3rd of the way to 60 in just the starting zone you will miss a grand majority of them.

It's actually some really bad writing.  It creates disjointed stories.   It's the reason why you end up with stories going all over the place instead of having focused plots and progressions.",wow

Not fun to play and meh damage. Prot pally is not in the best place. 4th or 5th worst tank for higher content right now. Our main tank is a prot pally and on H hounds in antorus he is getting one shot by the maw. Something that as my guardian druid alt I only take 40-50% health wise. They do good damage though so are nice for mythic+. Overall I would recommend pally if you want to heal but this is only advice for someone trying to push endgame content. ,wow

2160711,Blizzard talked about increasing the experience needed to get to max level a couple of months ago I thought. \n\nReasons were that people were leaving zones too quickly because of level gains. Scaling will help with that. Zones felt empty. Immersion was killed and BoA gear helps bridge the gap. \n\nKeep in mind too that this is what people have been asking for. Players have been begging Blizzard to make the leveling experience feel more social. This fixes the problems that make it feel so empty. ,wow

As for frost it can be good given high enough ilvl t20 since with t21 4 piece st sims best with belt wrists and shattering strikes due to the t21 4 piece synergy with razorice. That will depend on how high you can tf t20 gear and will most likely need to be simmed.,wow

2224920,Yeah but Netherstorm?,wow
2225940,They removed group quests a long long time ago.  This was intentional.  You did have to have 3 or 5 people for those quests.  They decided this was kind of dumb to force grouping for what is essentially solo content and tuned down those quests.  They\u2019re not going to go back and change back an intentional change.,wow
2226844,Yeah I like the old one more. It looks more like what an undead would be imagined to look like. The new one could just be a human with glowing eyes and very pale skin.,wow
2227127,It's important to remember your cast range is not relevant for double IL only the range to the hitbox center (impact point of IL). On something small like Mistress these will be fairly close but a boss like fallen avatar can cause them to differ significantly.\n\n\nAdditionally you have to go by feel as there is no way to determine the relevant distance in game through add-ons etc.\n\n\n It's also worth noting if you were practicing on the order hall dummy they have a very weird hitbox causing them to be extremely far away.,wow

Getting hit a little harder doesnt do much it just makes you take more time to get to max where theres at least some stuff you have to dodge out right.\n\nI see this argument all the time but time invesment does not equal difficult.\n\nThat being said I like scaling so its whatever.,wow

The whole point of a trial is to give players a taste of the game to make them want to buy it.

2333624,yes the intended value is surely 0. because blizz hates you.,wow
2335425,There is a lot more variety now to leveling even if you just dungeon. Take for example the 25-30 area where you only have gnomer to level currently for dungeons. You will be able to get any 15-25 dungeon. Same thing with 50-60 where you only have the BRM dungeons on Live.,wow

I'd say disable them in Mythic raiding too because racials are the reason why the balance between faction at the top end is so skewed towards Horde side because they have better and more useful racials to bring to raiding. \n\nKeep them for open world. Keep them for casual content. Let the high end scene pick of races be defined not by being forced into playing a certain race or faction for gameplay but rather the identity that the person chooses. ,wow

2664015,There will be tuning before Mythic opens so there is no need to fuss about balance right now. \n\nMM is **extremely** strong for M+ and have always been so and will continue to be so. T21 4-piece + T20 2-piece is very strong for M+. COF+Boots makes you trueshot so many packs. ,wow

2665003,You just have excellent gear. That is all. I play my rotation perfectly with shitty normal ToS 2 piece at 920 and Im consistently at 1 mil dps. I dont even have the legendary boots. Its literally just gear.  ,wow

2674032,Has she? Look back at the start of legion when conflict and tension was running high between her and the council. She walked away and let them  continue their plan without sabotaging or interfering with it. She has caused no harm to the war effort. That strikes me as an example of her strong restraint and self control making her back down without causing a fight.,wow
