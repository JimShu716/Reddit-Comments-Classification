Part of me says that this whole thing really does show that Valve doesn't care.  The other part says that Valve is a really smart company and maybe they think/know that shutting down something like this would be near impossible.  Like stopping piracy.  These sites may be able to operate even without  Valve's API.  Maybe Valve doesn't want to doom themselves to the special place in hell reserved for the MPAA and RIAA who have been trying to stop piracy since it first began and have literally fighting it since.  The fight against piracy will never stop and maybe Valve doesn't want to fight an endless war.,GlobalOffensive
