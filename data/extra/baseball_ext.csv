530451,By good matchups I mean favorable ones. The best matchup on paper I went to was Jose Quintana vs Danny Duffy and that game was insane and really made me love Q before he was a Cub. \n\nHowever Jon Lester and Aaron Blair had a fucking insane dual at Wrigley in 2016. It was sometime in April. The Braves scored off Jon Lester early and the Cubs were struggling to get anything going. Eventually the game gets tied up at 1-1 and both teams are really getting outmatched by the opposing number on the mound. Jon Lester eventually gets the bases loaded with no outs and then proceeds to Retire the next three batter in the most tense atmosphere I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of seeing. In the most unlikely scenarios Matt Szczur hits a grand slam in the very next inning after a pitching change. I think the Cubs ended up winning 6-1 while scoring 5 in the 8th. It was intense! ,baseball

791606,Can we steal the AL West next year like the NL Central did this past year? ,baseball
791777,I believe it has more to do with not being offered a closers role. He had a rough end to his Nationals career but he simply asked to be released if he wasnt going to close. There no doubt some team with the need for a pen arm would take a shot on him but he definitely does not want to pitch in a lower role than the closers role. Its all he knows really. He was a starter in the minors and briefly in 05 when he first came up but was instantly pushed into the closers role in 06 after an injury to Foulke. He had been a closer every year since the start of 06. Hes also expressed his desire to become the all time saves leader. So his personality may draw some teams away but I think some teams wouldve added him as a pen arm last offseason or at the end of 2016. The problem is they wouldnt annoint him closer and that is what he wants.,baseball

1870056,Maris was already elite home run hitter in 1960. He hit 39 home runs in 136 games while the MLB leader had 41 in 156 games. He finally was healthy for a full season in 1961 and at age 27 was in his prime. And one of the the biggest factors that people forget is that 1961 was an expansion year so pitching was weaker than usual and home runs were up around the league. After 1961 he was plagued by injuries and the stress took its toll on him.,baseball

2539608,Just a quick explanation of how far Zimmerman came this year.\n\nHe was worth **-1.3 fWAR** last season. This year he was worth **3.3 fWAR**. Last year he finished with a wRC+ of **67**. This season he finished with a wRC+ of **138**. That's a swing of being 33% below league average to being 38% above league average. On to traditional stats. He went from .218/.272/.370 to .303/.358/.573. He brought his BB% up and his K% down. He hit 36 HR this season opposed to 15 last season. Zimmerman this year was far and away the comeback player of the year. With the result this year we might as well rename it to the injury return award.,baseball

2828400,No that isn't the way it works all teams would work towards making the floor. So a lot of average players would get overpriced since GMs want to make their team better right now so they have a job in the future so even if it hurts the team in the long run. Instead now they just say hey I saved money by not spending and the team will be much better in 4 years. So when Grienke comes up for a contract and the Diamondbacks already have 120 million in salary they are not going to pay Grienke  30 million on top of that making their payroll 150 million.  So it cuts out competitors for Grienke contract so he loses money which would result in him not making 30 million  a year and gives a unfair advantage to big markets.,baseball

2850853,[Whats wrong with Wedge](http://cdn1us.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeekus/files/2017/02/star-wars-wedge-antilles.jpg),baseball
2851174,They still haven't confirmed that I am out of the running.,baseball
2851687,hi,baseball
2851965,Wonderful news. I was going to jump off a bridge if we let Girardi go for Eric Wedge. ,baseball
2852029,I actually love the dark grey with the electric blue lining.,baseball
2852157,Ugh gotta be hard for Giants and Cards fans..then blue balls must be awful ,baseball
2852283,none of these guys are on girardi's level. i find this whole thing just completely bizarre. Meulens? Boone? Eric freaking Wedge? cmon,baseball
2852288,He certainly knows steroids earn you half a billion. ,baseball
2853774,This feels like the Greinke situation. Most people thought it was between the Dodgers and Giants and then the DBacks decided they wanted to make the stove explode.,baseball
2853835,The cool thing about that situation was seeing the current/former players standing up for him. Just shows how liked and respected he is around the league. ,baseball
2853889,&gt;rubbed him up\n\n;),baseball
2854900,I will! Memories last forever.,baseball
2856012,Make sure to send Yurriel with the contingent to commit sepuku in case he needs that little extra to be convinced,baseball
2856971,phillies outta nowhere?,baseball
2858015,and skeeters,baseball
2859306,Nah watch it be the rays or reds ,baseball
2863040,:D,baseball
2863185,The Rays cringe at the idea of any contract larger than the league minimum ,baseball
2863282,If the Dodgers just swoop in at the last second I swear...,baseball
2864350,It happened with Cliff Lee's return IIRC ,baseball
2865261,Jump from the tallest bridge in NYC right?,baseball
2866073,Jeets is looking like the boss from National Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation,baseball
2867280,My Mets friends used to hate the Yankees more until recently. They absolutely are disgusted by the Nats,baseball
2867295,There is a god. He really fell off a cliff after May 2016,baseball
2867463,The 4th page is interesting because it shows a list of lesser notable players that didn't go through NPB and tried to get into the majors. Never knew there were that many guys that tried to do it,baseball
2867913,&gt; he was hay.\n\nSo Jeter is a scarecrow?,baseball
2868375,Experience definitely wasn't as big a deal to the yankees based on the 6 candidates they interviewed.,baseball
2868831,Judging from game 7 the dodgers aren\u2019t too competitive /s,baseball
2868902,I hate everything. ,baseball
2869157,Lol you apparently haven't watched him pitch recently,baseball
2869390,Good luck Bam Bam! ,baseball
2869895,Long live 1990!,baseball
2870460,I can\u2019t imagine turning down the kind of cash he\u2019d be getting if he just waited until he was 25. Crazy stuff,baseball
2870703,Joe managed the yankees for 10 years. Yanks were fully aware of what they were doing when they let Joe go. Maybe they believed he wasn't as good of a manager as the league thinks he is.  ,baseball
2871909,Hope the boys in blue can make some this season :),baseball
2872339,[deleted],baseball
2872526,If only there had been a local billionaire interested in buying the team. &gt;.&gt;,baseball
2873643,This is the clarification I was looking for! So this is likely the same as the meeting the Giants had with Stanton\u2019s people yesterday. ,baseball
2875035,He better be. I guess we submitted our answers to him but Hahn says he sees it as a long shot. ,baseball
2876063,Oh no Jeets what is you doin?,baseball
2877375,[deleted],baseball
2878783,Thomson grew up a Yankees fan and committed his whole career to them. He was holding out for the Yankees managerial position for so damn long. Cant believe they forced him out this unceremoniously. Really starting to hate New Yorks current ownership.,baseball
2880639,&gt; and it is expected that he will also make a body for next season in parallel with medical checks and negotiations\n\nHis clones will play for all five teams!,baseball
2881147,I said south Cali ya dingus,baseball
2881423,[deleted],baseball
2883019,And then the locals will chase him away just like Steph,baseball
2883892,That part of the movie ruined me.,baseball
2883934,Fucking Yankees.,baseball
2884049,Good for you but I'd rather own a house and have equity.,baseball
