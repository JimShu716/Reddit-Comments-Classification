136290,It came from the Textus Receptus which is the original Greek text.  It's the one that has a lineage of translations which the Vatican burned people at the stake for owning and/or translating.  William Tyndale for instance prayed to God that the King of England would have his eyes opened as he was burning at the hands of Vatican agents.  The Vatican also tried to have King James killed with the Gunpowder Plot for ordering the translation.\n\nThe other reason is if you go through and compare very important verses with other bible translations you will see major problems in other versions such as the removal of proof texts that Jesus is God and things like that.  The NIV actually makes it seem like the Antichrist is Jesus so if you are studying that one when the Antichrist shows up you will likely think he's Jesus and take his mark and be doomed. ,conspiracy

888240,http://www.local8now.com/content/news/Wallet-saved-life-of-Las-Vegas-shooting-victim-449510633.html\n\nThis is the perfect example of a placed story in media.  The earliest version circulated has a video of the father telling the story including him saying his son kept the bullet.  That would not be possible.  Witnesses are not allowed to keep evidence.  The police would keep the bullet for the case file.  Later versions of the story like your link omitted that part of him keeping the bullet probably because someone informed them of the inconsistency.\n\nIt's a fake story purposefully placed in the media.,conspiracy
888860,The way an explosion works is that it produces a pressure difference/wave. Think of it as throwing a rock into a pond. The bird that flies by will be unaffected but when it lands in the lake the adjacent fish will notice.\n\nIn an unrestricted vacuum like space we get the same effect. The molecules \u201cset free\u201d by the chemical reaction will not have to push any existing molecules away in all directions in the medium to expand (since there simply is no medium). Thus no pressure wave in the medium. Thus no \u201ceffect\u201d of the explosion.\n\nAnother way to think of it is that is also why a vacuum is completely frictionless. No reaction occurs between the molecules in an moving object and  the surrounding ones (since there are none). If you would drop that rock high up in space within earths attraction field it will pick up speed constantly until it encounters the atmosphere. And then as with meteorites it will burn up because of the high momentum it has picked up in the vaccum causing an intense reaction with the surrounding molecules.\n,conspiracy

He is baiting insiders leading them along with combination of truth bombs and programed lies designed to make the insiders question their loyalty and wake up. The low level shills shadowing Gordon Duff don't know what is lies and what truth so they have to ask their superiors and the superiors have to ask their bosses. This filters up the chain of command causing a lot of disruption along the way.\n\nMost operatives within the deep state are compartmentalized and think what they are doing is patriotic while unknowingly serving traitors to the Constitution. When the operatives have to continually question what they are doing then it disrupts the compartmentalization within the deep state. Low and mid level operatives end up finding out \""too much\"" which eventually causes them to wake up to what they are doing is evil. This causes them to flip to the good side and white hats within the deep state.",conspiracy
