The contract must have a length of at least 1 season (the 2018-19 season being the first). \n\nThis can't include sign-and-trade though since technically he'd be signing the extension with the Coyotes but it would be for the purpose of going to another team and we can safely assume it was part of a purposeful departure on his part.\n\nI'd also change the 1 year contract requirement to 2 years+...other than that I'm good with it.,hockey

2115939,I just don't want to see players giving up on the backcheck in fear something like this will happen. I am no ref but I have to imagine when a player is breaking all eyes are on that player- it's not like they are witnessing this out the corner of their eye.\n\n\nEven if this happened the other way around I'd be annoyed. Solid defensive players are just as exciting as scoring goals. I enjoyed the shit out of seeing Datsyuk rob people from behind- a clean play like this is always fun To see,hockey

Most of them are straight up comical tbh and if you watched a good team (the penguins) maybe you would understand what a goal is where skill straight up beats skill. I haven't seen Matt \""Aces Over Eights\"" Murray let in a single one of these in any of these past 3 seasons. Maybe just 2 or 3. I don't know if one of his obviously Scandinavian ancestors killed a leprecon while raiding England or what but this has been some WWE levels of \""\""\""skill\""\""\"" on display vs Matt \""Black Cat\"" Murray lately.\n\nSo shut your mouth about things you know nothing about there is only one tier 1 goalie in the league.

Barzal to me is the main reason we are the top offense in the NHL right now he is electric every time he is out on the ice. I hope they actually watch some Islanders games before they vote instead of just looking at the stat sheet.
