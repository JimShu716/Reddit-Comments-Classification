But I\u2019d say Jurassic Park if we are just talking all time personal favorite(if I gotta choose).\n\nThis was actually my second opinion you probably won\u2019t like coming up next. I think the original Alien is beautiful with good actors but extremely mediocre otherwise. In fact I think Ridley Scott is just a terrible Director. I\u2019ve never seen him direct something that stood out aside from it looking insanely good.  I wish he\u2019d strictly be a cinematographer and in charge of set design. Just hate the man. But we all have directors we hate.  Aliens is alright(I guess). \n\nStudio Ghibli is really good even though I\u2019m not very into Japanese stuff. Spirited Away and Mononoke are great from memory. Grave of the fireflies was way overrated. Sorry to say I was not sad at all. ,movies

Especially since the movie made a point about how creepy it is for a 50+ year old man to be dating someone half his age.  Almost every scene between Woody harrelson and his wife would have played better if the actress had been within 10 years of his age at least.  It would have given the audience a sense of  deep connection and familiarity between the couple.  \n\nBut having a 35 year old actress play against a 56 year old man in a cutesy long-term marriage way makes it seem almost skeevy.   Add the girls accent and I am left almost wondering if she was bought online as a bride from overseas. \n\nIt served no purpose to the plot except for random and unneeded eye-candy.  ,movies

730864,Every movie Robert De Niro has done in the past 10-15 years. ,movies
731400,Lol. Good point on the villains as role models - its a dicey premise. I guess the point is meant to be that most villains or antagonists are portrayed with at least one redeeming quality or flaw that audiences can relate to - it makes them more believable. Someone that's pure evil or pure good is boring in a narrative and they don't often survive that long as a character in a movie. They're usually the first ones to get bumped off. It's an interesting article for its attempt to turn things upside down. I'd agree with it not being on the rise though but the personification has definitely changed.,movies

A lot of them will also harass the families of the victims (many murdered kids parents end up getting creepy phone calls from complete strangers saying they know what happened or claiming to be the dead kid;  people are fucked up) \n\nI think the guy just didnt get the respect he thought he would automatically be due upon becoming a soldier and is pissed about it. \n\nMaybe he is a rapist;  but I definitely dont think he killed anyone. More likely he is just a fucked up guy who read the story in a newspaper and decided to manipulate a grieving mother because it made him feel superior.,movies

1036362,This is really the biggest issue with BvS. They didn't show him being popular. And that wouldn't be a problem if the arc in that regard was that it took him dying for people to really appreciate him. People hating him from the start because of the destruction and then finally realising what they'd lost. Makes sense and could have been really interesting.\n\nBut that's at odds with the actual plot of BvS. BvS is about Lex turning a world that had *already* accepted him against him. But of course not showing any of that meant there was no drama in seeing it being taken away. Superman looks moody rather than a man who had lost something important. The way it's portrayed in the film is at odds with the actual plot. It looks like people have been hating him for two years and he still hasn't managed to come to terms with that. It looks like Lex is making a world that already hates Superman hate him just a little bit more. Just a two minute montage at the start of BvS to get his popularity across would have made a huge difference.,movies

Nothing sounded like it before when I went to the theater to see it when I was 15. It was trying to achieve something very different but I really respect Spielberg and John Williams for realizing the two battle scenes shouldn\u2019t have music (I felt Dunkirk could have toned down some of the music to let the on screen sound take prominence). Just that pure visceral sound of machine gun fire when Spielberg goes to those first person shots of them shooting down on the beach. Fun fact the sound mixing was done by Gary Rystrom who has something like a billion Oscar nominations for sound work in films. ,movies

1310407,&gt;Yes now let's keep pretending that Superman JL is not like Donners even though he literally ripped him off.\n\nIt really isn't. The thing that makes Donner's Superman is that we see his everyday human life(which makes him more relatable than the Snyder version like you are talking about). Just because Superman is happy and saves people does not make Superman Donner's Superman. That is like saying every Superman is the same Superman.\n\n&gt;If JL superman didnt turn people over nothin will.\n\nWhat the crap are you talking about? The only thing everyone hated about Superman in JL is his stupid moustache shit. Superman was one of the most praised things of the movie.\n\nSuperman Returns was not a good version of Reeves Superman dude. Do you not understand that? It was not because it was with Donner's Superman but because the movie was utter crap. Wonder Woman is literal proof that a Donner like Superman movie can work. The entire movie was inspired from the original Superman movies and it shows and it is one of the biggest successes of the year.\n\nYou seem to not realise that every Superman movie after Superman 2 were made by less talented directors who made a bad movie. A good Superman movie could work just like how a good Superman comic still works.\n\nAlso they can't make him the Hulk of the universe. That is like making Captain America the Hulk of the MCU.\n\nYou are making assumptions from crappy films. MoS didn't make Superman relatable either. Superman was already relatable in the Donner movies. Snyder just made a crappier character.,movies

1362516,yea but the way that is all actually set up and executed is a bit of a deconstruction of some anime tropes.  it's a sometimes funny sometimes dark satire kind of like madoka magicka.  the whole transformation with the uniform turning into the skimpy armor and the fact that the big sword is half of a pair of scissors is not so subtly poking fun at stuff like sailor moon and bleach.  that's kinda the point.

1363783,1999 when it was in the theaters. I'm a very skeptical person so I figured it out quickly but my friend had talked it up so much that I thought it had to be something much more sinister. Like he was an evil ghost or the it was all in his mind or something. It just seemed too obvious the way my friend had made it sound. Then the same friend hyped up Signs just as much and I went and saw that and thought it was a total shit movie. A few scare jumps and I liked Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix but the movie was just terrible and the twist was the fucking worst.  ,movies

1378327,I agree with a lot of this; there were several points in the movie where something happened that was so ridiculously unlike how that scene would play out in real life that it took me out of the movie.  Remember when the Ex literally physically assaulted Mildred and the son held a knife to his neck to get him to let go? That scene is resolved by the ditzy new girlfriend basically making fun of the situation and (having just seen her boyfriend almost choke to death his ex wife) heads out to his car.  What!?,movies

2167424,Yes you are correct. Cotton was the biggest slave labor along with tobacco in the US. It was considered black breaking work because you were bent over constantly. To add to this cotton has sharp burs on it. When it was ready to be harvested slaves had to pick it bare handed 18 hours a day while getting whipped if you were not fast enough. The bags they carried around the field could way up to 300 lb (136 kg) if they were good cotton pickers. Children were not exempt and by 12 did the same work as an adult. So it was pretty ironic that cotton ended up saving his life.,movies

It wouldnt be a sustainable survival practice.    \n  \nThe road might be an accurate portrayal  of just after the event when people are desperate and panicking but the movie and book take place a decade after the event and by then stuff would settle down. ,movies
