195880,Does the Cowboys game plan include getting any 1st downs at all?,nfl
195898,Theory: Zeke moves so fast that Dak last year was never on the field. It was just Zeke moving back and forth really fast creating the image of two players. It was actually Zeke making all the throws.,nfl

196620,The ball will be placed on the 1/1000000th yard line.,nfl

198162,Calling a safety now. 2-0 going into half ,nfl
198178,I really feel it is not too different. Just a little recency bias and an increase in ad free television like netflix that reduces our tolerance for it.,nfl
198183,Dak looks really bad. Haven't seen this kind of regress since RG3.,nfl
198211,How many Dak Prescotts does it take to score a touchdown?,nfl

198829,Or Dak...,nfl
198860,Was that 5 year old actually expecting a car for Xmas?,nfl
198910,Every run has been off tackle. Same play over and over it's laughable ,nfl
198942,is it time for the Cowboys to put out their own ginger QB?,nfl

199539,Would you rather have cousins at the 1 yard line or Dak at the opponents 40 yard line?,nfl

428793,Have you used the legal ESPN streams? Complete shit ,nfl
428862,Jerry Jones looks like a freckled penis,nfl
428929,I feel like no matter what the face of a franchise deserves to play as long as they want (to an extent).  \n\nBrady should be allowed to play to 45 If he chooses.  Shit 48 if that's what he wants. \n\nWhen people wanted osweiler to keep playing over Peyton  I felt it was super ridiculous.  \n\nThis situation with Eli is the same thing. \n\nThe shit with Romo last season. I said it then and I'll say it now.  Cowboys probably would've been in the Superbowl instead of the falcons with Romo over Dak.  I'd have absolutely put Romo back in when he was healthy without even a little hesitation.  Romo was imo easily Better than dak has or ever will be.  Plus rookies don't win championships.  There was 0 chance with Dak last year.  Romo could've came in fresh and led them through the end of season and through playoffs. \n\nIf the lions do this to Stafford at any point in the future I'll be furious.  I'd rather have a few losing seasons at the end of my QBs career Than to treat him with any disrespectful shit like this and Stafford hasn't even got us a ring yet.  \n\n,nfl

445483,I've said this before. When we heard about color rush uniforms most fans assumed some kinda logical color choices for each team and it seems the NFL has done the exact opposite. For Denver San Diego last year I expect Denver to pretty much just wear orange pants and chargers to be in all powder blue. Nope changed logo on helmets and made it to small. It was wierd. ,nfl

For equal $ I'd sign Morris. How much would you pay Hyde? Morris will sign 3yr 7M with 5 guaranteed. Maybe for less since he still drives his 92 Mazda. Morris is also low miles for his age. 120 carries over last 2 years.  Never gets hurt. Same size. Same speed. Huge hands and catches everything. 1600yds as a rookie with Kyle.,nfl

If you go around and ask random people on the street to name as many nfl teams as they can...I bet the titans would be the least said. Even the decade long bad teams like the browns or jags people know because they are famous for being bad. Titans have been just pretty bad to meh every year making them an afterthought. ,nfl

531271,I was going to ask if that was blood or turf paint or something.,nfl
531526,Actually we just surpassed you guys on Sunday. We've been monitoring it for a while. Coming into the season you were about 700 ahead of us and we got a big bandwagon here lately.,nfl
531568,Have you seen the way Taylor Lewan defends Mariota? Something like that. Didn\u2019t think this needed to be explained lol ,nfl
531677,Well there is a chance just a minuscule one ,nfl
531700,So you think Josh Gordon will be better than AB? That's the original pint i was arguing.,nfl
531789,Our running game has been fine the last few weeks. Fortunately we kept the redskins off the scoreboard long enough even with our slow start offensively. It allowed us to stick to the run and not have to abandon our game plan and pass 30+ times,nfl
531874,You know I\u2019ll be here cuz I\u2019ll always have the ass whopping we put on \u201cdem boys\u201d to get me through the off season but hey you\u2019ll always have the Spotify playlist of Jason Garrett clapping to soothe you to sleep ,nfl

533231,Yay we won,nfl
533298,The internet.\n\nI don\u2019t remember where I read it but it was in an article recently. Basically the reasoning is if they transition tag him then another team with a shitload of cap space is just gonna front load it anyway so if they are gonna tag they might as well franchise him and not let another team dictate the contract since next years money will be similar.,nfl

546296,He's a 2nd year qb doing 2nd year qb shit. He got happy feet when the O Line became a wet noodle for the last few weeks. It solidified itself around half time and he looked night and day better. ,nfl
546347,The redskins 7 losses:\n\n(2) Eagles\n\n(2) Dallas\n\n(1) Minnesota\n\n(1) New Orleans\n\n(1) September Kansas City \n\nPretty tough sledding for a team with that many injuries. ,nfl

556262,The timing of the turnovers were huge. Redskins would have been up either 7-0 or 3-0 and Dak looked seriously uncomfortable early in the game. Losing the field position and keeping the game tied let dallas get their heads in the game.,nfl

562601,Oh so like in rugby,nfl
562632,He defends him after ruffing the passer/ late hits. This was a clean hit on the shoulder pads. Why would they get upset over that hit? If they want to protect their QB then maybe they should have blocked Irving. Not get a personal foul called on them for a perfectly fine hit. ,nfl
562695,Holy shit I thought you were being sarcastic since the season is almost over lmao. I'm a huge Wentz fan but Wilson is mVp to me this season. Seattle would look like jax maybe worse without Wilson. ,nfl

570102,I've listen since episode 8 or something. It was much better before the season started. He does a Sunday night podcast with AJ Hawk (ex Packers LB) called laces out. Its much better and more football related. The pat McAfee pod is just random interviews of people promoting new shows you've never heard of/ random athlete that you probably don't care about. ,nfl
570141,I see you're taking this in stride.,nfl
570220,I don\u2019t think it being a clean hit or a dirty hit is relevant in this specific situation I just expected to see more frustration from a team getting blown out in a must win against a division rival,nfl
570525,IIRC when you retire it\u2019s as if you never had that contract the moment you sign the paperwork. There is no duty to preform clause.,nfl
570749,Just reading that makes me feel unclean,nfl
570966,Eh that isn\u2019t funny enough to put on a shirt ,nfl
571370,Exact same. Ever since the split I\u2019ve found myself listening to the old crew before the PMS one. I also listen to laces out though. And that\u2019s like 2 hours of him talking. Definitely possible to have too much Pat in your life,nfl
571549,Did you even read the article? It's not this game lol,nfl

573099,I dunno about that. Calvin Johnson?,nfl
573143,so?,nfl
573390,I did a few episodes of laces out but just couldn't get into it. It was basically a second PMS with a little bit of football mixed in. ,nfl

573610,That is correct. :(,nfl
573782,Just don't go in their bathrooms by yourself.,nfl
573903,Yea I was wondering how Emmitt Smith only scored 71 TDs,nfl

581266,I really need to sub to heartland. I miss behind the badge and the Jim Kong updates. I hate his random ass interviews he tries to sell me on now. He literally talked to some kids who are rebooting the myth busters show. Feels like a total cash grab. The show should only be NFL players. ,nfl

583170,I'll say it again. I'm sure they were frustrated but why would they put their team in an even worse situation by getting a stupid personal foul called on them? How would you have them express their frustration? Start throwing punches and getting suspended/ fined? ,nfl

He is in full control the entire time. Defensively you guys would match up against any AFC team and offensively as well... I just feel like this is the year.

They have the 5th most penalties called against them at 85 and the second fewest beneficial calls at 64. \n\nCowboys games are low penalty games in general. It has gone both ways.

862069,Ok im sorry but is no one gonna say it? You just pulled out some stupid ass stats. How about Points per game? Yards per game? Passing yards per game? Total turnovers? Let me do it. \n\n\n2011 Saints Offense:\n\nRecord 13-3\n\n34 points per game \n\n344 passing yards per game \n\n132 Rushing Yards per game \n\n476 TOTAL YARDS PER GAME. \n\n46 passing touchdowns \n\n16 rushing touchdowns \n\n19 turnovers \n\n\n2016 Falcons Offense: \n\nRecord 11-5\n\n33 Points per game \n\n295 Passing yards per game \n\n120 rushing yards per game \n\n415 Total yards per game \n\n38 Passing Touchdowns \n\n20 Rushing Touchdowns \n\n11 turnovers. \n\n\n\nAll of this clearly proves that the 2011 saints would have Face Fucked the Falcons. We all forget that the 2011 saints rushing attack was almost as dominant as 2017. Those are the numbers that truly matter. The only thing the falcons did better was not turn the ball over. ,nfl

You can go through any game for any team and find dozens of missed calls (holding calls especially). This isn't proving anything more than that opponents have had calls missed. Doesn't show that the Cowboys have been treated unfairly and have had all their calls made with none missed. \n\nThe facts don't lie.

923115,Slightly off topic but let\u2019s say a star QB is in concussion protocol and the backup QB is scared. Can he simply refuse to snap the ball until the star QB recovers?\n\nDelay of game penalties x100.... ball simply never gets snapped. The game will have to be postponed until star QB recovers. Then Star QB comes in and resumes the game a week or two later.\n\nIs there anything in the rules that prevents this scenario from happening? You literally control the game since you have the ball. The ref can penalize you but can\u2019t force you to snap or punt. Simply make all the players sit down on the field Indian style and refuse to play until their teammate makes a full recovery. What\u2019s stopping them?,nfl

949911,You guys would be a good fit for Keenum if Ruthlessburger decides to retire in the next year or two. He would tide you over while you figure out a permanent guy or there is the chance he is actually improving (he looks much better right now then the last few years which where ok) and you could have a new franchise QB right away. This would also give you buffer time to wring out other inconsistencies in the draft rather then use a late 1st for a QB which is likely what you will have. ,nfl

Dak was at his best game tonight that he had for a while and you guys ran all over the Skins.  He literally had everything going for him and he did nothing.,nfl

Hahaa you don't understand football this is great.  You guys rushed for 170 yards against the Skins so don't use Zeke as an excuse as to why you win.  You guys just aren't good and that's why you can only beat 1/2 of a football team lol.  Omg this is hilarious.. yeah you clearly out match me lmfao!,nfl

1077118,yeah i feel you. I think him being a quiet dude definitely could hurt his chances. tbh i only replied because i cant sleep and you seem bored and wanted a debate lol. ive always been big on the best of the best making it though. qbs are obviously different but rivers to me is better than eli and big ben however he was never the best and doesent have the ring to go with it. eli has the story and ben played at a high enough level that his 2 rings could push him in. players like gore and lynch though if they made it i wouldnt argue against it and if they didnt i wouldnt argue for it. ,nfl

1179282,They can\u2019t really transition. \n\nSome cash rich team will just frontload a contract. That would require Redskins to match deal and pay Cousins some absurd number for 2018. They\u2019re better off franchising him again at $35m than risking the transition tag. \n\nIt\u2019s time to either work out a deal or let him go. ,nfl

Flash puts the game in another level and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his skill and athleticism for the game again. Brady breaks record. Manning breaks records. Gordon smokes the bong. You can keep the statistics. I prefer the magic.,nfl

1195573,Okay but part of Brady's greatness was that he was immediately thrust into the starting position and succeeded right away. Won games and Super Bowls right away. Would Rodgers have done the same? Maybe who knows... probably. Wish he got the chance but he didnt ,nfl

1197441,Damn. Ours has sucked as of late due to the misery brought upon the fans this season. ,nfl
1197985,Rightfully so,nfl
1198448,No.  A team offering Cousins a 6 year contract will offer loads more guaranteed money than a team offering a 3 year contract.  That's the beauty of being a free agent.\n\nPlayers and agents don't think in terms of the next contract being even higher.  They think the next snap may blow out your knee and you'll never play again.\n\nA player would almost never take a deal with less guaranteed money long term.,nfl

1208723,Wait really?? Wow I thought we did ,nfl
1209008,That Barry was ineffective in the playoffs and was a lot of his fault why he never made a super bowl. No it was because of never having a qb who punished teams for stacking the box with the exception of the one game we actually won where I think his name was Eric Kramer threw for 300+ yards and punished the cowboys for stacking the box allowing Barry to get some oppurtunities,nfl
1209225,I was just pointing him out as a special exception. He's clearly making less from his paycheck than what he could in the NFL. And there seem to be a host of reasons for it. But that's not your average players situation. ,nfl

1395131,That's not cheating.,nfl
1395303,If you want something that correlates to wins use ANY/A,nfl
1395379,More so I think. Look at the Vikes downgraded QB but improved Oline and we are doing pretty good this year compared to 3 wins in 11 games to finish last year.,nfl
1395563,Yeah I love silicon valley but damn those commercials are annoying,nfl
1395699,Really? Your defense played lights out for most of the first half. The team can't keep up with the injuries.,nfl
1396306,The 49ers are tagging Garoppolo. Do you think they traded a 2nd round pick for 8 games?,nfl
1396374,Wait is this true? So after the horrible bungling of this situation the Skins could actually gain assets? I find that hard to believe but know nothing of the ins and outs of franchise tags. I always thought everyone said the Redskins would be insane to tag him again after this year cause it would cost like $40MM...,nfl

1405141,Looks like they did last year too but it's not every year.  I just never noticed it before.  ,nfl
1405314,Well doesn't it work against the argument he's a bad HC if the team that he built used his system and managed to go to the Super Bowl? ,nfl

1407610,Larry Fitzgerald and the Cardinals beating the Packers in the 2009 Divisional. I was a youngling back then in a family of packers fans. I remember cheering for the Cardinals cuz I'm a dipshit. Also the Saints Colts Super Bowl I remember crying about the colts losing even though I didn't know anything.

1407949,So she's trying to dis Courtney Love by confirming what Courtney Love said?,nfl
1407981,Wow why would they not do that,nfl
1407986,I think our secondary is good enough to stop that from happening (while the Seahawks secondary is MIA) but this game is really going to show our true colors as a defense. I\u2019m excited for it!,nfl

1412257,Randy Moss 3 catches for 3 TDs when I was 3 years old. ,nfl

I\u2019ve been rooting for him since he took over because he is a bit of an underdog story. I really hope we can land him in the offseason but if we can\u2019t I want the team he plays for to have his back. ,nfl

1492448,Where are you pulling the magical RB statline from? The 3/5 QB had 3 completions for 100 yards and 3 TD with the RB having 2 receptions for 20 yards and 2 TD and the 3rd reception to a WR for an 80 yard TD. Give the RB 999 yards and 55 TDs since I don't know where your RBs numbers came from or how they are relevant to completion percentage in this sitation. The 3/5 QB did the same thing on half the attempts. ,nfl

1716306,I loved all 3 QBs but i personally didnt like Vick because of what he did but found him amazing to watch play,nfl
1716547,It's interesting how some of the sophomore QBs this year turned massive corners. Goff literally didn't know where the sun rose last season. Now he's lighting it up. These could be the QBs we'll see tearing it up for 15+ years.,nfl
1716649,Could Eli really be gone after this year? i can't imagine that at all,nfl
1716746,Can we get him to finish off the season?,nfl
1717111,Blame a dead guy for sucking 20 years later. That's just sad man.,nfl
1717422,Yeah I agree with you on that. Only putting up 14 points sucks but it's not really possible to drop back and throw deep often with the line at it's current state.,nfl

1719053,It's kind of ironic that he left New England so he could play more snaps at his preferred position and he ended up playing significantly fewer snaps in Philly on the most stacked D-line in the league while the Patriots are in dire need for more depth on the edge,nfl

1724711,Really hate when people air their dirty laundry for everyone to see. It's bad enough when people do it on social media but the fact he did it on TV would be even more infuriating if i was Aaron. Its a private matter and there's no reason anyone outside of his family should be involved or need to know. Low class move by his brother.,nfl

But then on the first play of the next drive hit like an 80 yard bomb on the first play. Your offense would have only ran 10 plays over 4 drives and your defense would be hurting. ,nfl

1732820,Next season he has a 14.5M base salary for KC. So the team that trades a mid to late round pick for the 34 year old will have to make some room. ,nfl

1761992,I mean I feel that way but more so with Peyton Manning instead of Rodgers. The difference between Rodgers and those two is that Rodgers holds onto the ball too much and can't make the same pre-snap adjustments/reads and release the ball out quickly like those two can. ,nfl

1823101,100k is decent money though. So often we see people getting busted for corruption or embezzlement or whatever and it's like 10 grand. People with decent jobs risking their careers and potentially jail time over relatively paltry amounts of cash. It's crazy. ,nfl
1823162,Dudes been bad. Last year he wasn't a good pass rusher but at least he could play the run. This year the only reason he's out there is his reputation. Shouldn't be a problem because Peppers and Addison are still our top two guys and both are playing good this year.,nfl
1823200,Solved the teams naming problem too. Just change everything to potatoes and keep the name,nfl

1833232,Doesn't seem worth playing him at this point tbh. NFC wildcard will almost certainly be 10 wins minimum.,nfl
1833308,Even without pressure Flacco will checkdown to his running back in a clean pocket. Pisses me real off we're stuck with this guy until 2020. I mean sure the OC sucks bad but I think we need a new QB one that can scramble and hit those mid field darts,nfl

1836463,He will be Ben McAscrewed at the end of the season.  I am almost certain he's gone next year.,nfl

Jay may have been better than he is at one time but he certainly is not better then Ryan now. he has thrown most of his passes of his back foot and when he does there is no zip and horrible accuracy. in his defense miami QB's  all have the same issue. O line not holding up. 7 sacks and NE is not a major sacking team per say. probably would not have been better with Tennehill in but certainly would not have been worse. ,nfl

1973775,He has the right to get surgery even if he could play theough. He knew the Packers weren't winning anything this year so he decided to shut it down. Then the Packers ditched him with the questionable undisclosed injury claim. When he has an opportunity to play for a team withba real shot he changed his mind. How is this unreasonable?,nfl

1987326,I loved him going into the draft. The Honey Badger comparisons were obvious right from the start.

Look at PFF's pass rush productivity ratings for some reference pt; a guy like Carl Lawson who nobody hears about is well ahead of Barnett.

2479906,89 million sounds like a lot to you but in the long run its nothing. What exactly will they fix with this money? Will they get police to stop killing people (no because half of it is going to the UNCF and other organizations that have nothing to do with police reform)?\n\n\n\nAlso the NFL doesn't have to do anything. No one actually supporting the original cause wants the NFL to do anything (which is why 40 players dropped from the coalition). Kaep said it at that first press conference this is way bigger than the NFL (actually if I remember it was the 2nd thing out of his mouth after saying he isn't disrespecting the military or the flag).\n\n\nYou can say Reid is being petty but I think Jenkins is trying to hijack the movement for his own goals. Sure those goals are still commendable but he's selling out the original cause to do it (because I don't believe there's no under the table deal here to go along with the money). There's no need for that.,nfl

2514651,But Peyton looked physically incapable of playing.\n\n\n\n Like a dog that got hit by a truck and wasn't going to recover. You are sad it is getting put down but understand it's for the best. \n\n\n\nEli is a healthy dog that is being put down because the other dogs around him are playing like they got hit by a truck. ,nfl
2514834,That fair. The loss would have definitely stung less if it wasn't against Gabbert.,nfl

2517328,I\u2019m gonna go against the grain here and say that I think 80% of the color rush uniforms are awesome.,nfl
2517372,Absolutely. Dildos provide all sorts of feelings where Patriots players induce only rage,nfl
2517717,That's because Mara benched Eli to get a higher draft pick.  Or maybe Geno is the guy lol.,nfl
2517900,LeBron plays in stilettos.,nfl
2518190,grumbles,nfl
2518674,It's actually not a problem of predictability right now as much as it may seem.\n\nThe offense simply cannot run even the most basic of plays right now. The OL is completely lost and is the teams biggest issue right now. ,nfl
2519462,Ah - yeah that makes sense.  I didn't see the play Watt got hurt on.  If it was anything like mine (helmet to knee) then it's likely the type I had.  If not it could be the type you had.  How did you hurt yours?,nfl
2519471,Why I said maybe. I don't think Cutler was ever that great. I do think the Bears held him back a lot in his Prime though. ,nfl
2519540,They had also made the playoffs the year before with manning.\n\nThe browns have an entire roster of shit,nfl
2519915,Interesting how few repeats there are. Is there a single one?,nfl
2520227,its probably less about looking good and more about being memorable. kind of like the idiotic geico commercials,nfl
2520315,Maybe try moving down the field with plays for more than 2-4 yards. It\u2019s gunna take you like 15+ successful plays to go down the field. ,nfl
2520764,Ok?,nfl
2520971,Congrats!,nfl
2521044,I was joking about Eli but the OBJ argument isn\u2019t really that good of one even with him in the lineup for almost a year now the Giants have had an issue of putting up points. ,nfl
2521165,Honestly I think he was as accurate. Just lacked the touch Rodgers had. I mean in Philly Vick was incredibly accurate (he went deep more than anyone else so his completion percentage was low - similar to Wentz now) downfield but the closer to the los the harder it is to catch those 70 mph fast balls.,nfl

2530074,I think in certain circumstances it can be a conscious or subconscious decision. Will a guy not give a 100% at the end of a bad season? Probably not. At times like that a player must look around him and if he's sees his colleagues trying he is also likely to try or maybe he is determined to not let his opponent beat him even though the game/season is lost. It is definitely the sign of a good coach to keep his players motivated when all is lost.  ,nfl

2738478,Disagree. And for all the reasons above. Keenum is a terrible fit for Treadwell because he is so risk adverse and would be just as bad with Dez. I bet if Sam was playing Treadwell would have more than 500 yards and at least 2 TD's. Shurmer is going to work him into the rotation next year and it's going to be glorious to have Theilen/Diggs splitting time in the slot with Treadwell on the outside. Not to say Keenum is bad. This team needs elusive QB's with good reads and few mistakes. ,nfl
2739149,&gt; but what it's worth in terms of BoB's playcalling I think the 3rd down run play that got stopped in the SEA game was an RPO that Watson messed up - you could see BoB yelling at deshaun on the sidelines after that series. It's a very reasonable mistake for a rookie QB to make\n\nYou are correct. \n\nIt's easy to blame BOB's playcalling for being too conservative at times but I also feel like to do that discredits the playcalling he's done with healthy Watson that's helped him perform at the high level he does.,nfl

2749084,What a lot of people fail to understand is our scheme and how that relates to the failing of the run game. Reid's West Coast offense like all WCOs relies on the pass to open the run with horizontal passes...making the LBs open up. \n\nWhen Chris Conley went down it really hurt the offense. Then Albert Wilson was hurt for a few games so they were operating with only their #1 WR Hill (who isn't the kind of #1 that can handle the whole WR load) and Kelce. Along with that Smith started missing throws and has seemingly lost confidence in his Oline to block for him (he's been hit a lot in fairness).\n\nNow you have a passing game that is not really a threat at all. Teams are completely unafraid to get beat by the pass because they know their D can create enough pressure on smith that he can't throw deep and they'll just stop all the underneath throws. This also allows them to put 8-9 guys in the box.\n\nThis is where the run failing comes in. The LBs are not moving off the line and the safeties are playing down. The Oline and Kareem Hunt have absolutely no chance on nearly every run play. On a good handful of plays Hunt is getting hit as he's receiving the ball and on nearly every run play he's getting hit at or behind the line.\n\nFor the Chiefs to rebound Smith needs to regain confidence in his line and the Chiefs need to start getting back to the 10-15 yard sideline passes they were completing in the first five weeks. This will pull the LBs and safeties off the line and Hunt will be able to have holes to run into again.\n\nIt all starts with Alex and the passing game though... if you're watching the Chiefs game and see he's not completing passes to start the game and moving the ball passing the game will probably not go the Chiefs way. Establishing the short and intermediate pass game is everything to the Chiefs offense.,nfl
2749334,there's a common misconception that steroids only make you stronger. they also help recovery times and other crap like that. there's a reason peyton manning took HGH and it isn't for his athleticism.\n\n&gt;you think a guy like tom brady - he who is slow as shit and looks like this: http://cdn01.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/brady-sumo/tom-brady-goes-shirtless-for-sumo-wrestling-in-japan-06.jpg\n\nYou think a guy who is 40 or so and has been in the NFL for almost 2 decades isn't taking something to increase his recovery times? Those hits build up and I'd be surprised that brady isn't taking something to increase his recovery time AND to build some extra muscle to soften some of the hits he takes.\n\nPEDs definitely helps with some longevity issues. Compounds like HGH help a bunch too,nfl
