944921,Right. So let me get this straight. Not all lions and tigers and whatnot have an instantaneous desire to eat a mans face at the first opportunity? Is this because the continental death kitty has already eaten or it\u2019s been tamed to only eat prime cuts of impala. What\u2019s the deal?,funny
944983,What most people don't realize about cats is that you don't need to TRAIN them to use the litter. Cats hail from the desert and the litter we use simulates the sand. So there's a natural instinct there. You show a kitten where the box is and they automatically know to use the bathroom and burry it. Litter training cats is the easiest and most comfortable thing for them.\n\nDogs don't have that instinct. So I can't imagine the effort and the time that went into instructing a very unnatural thing to this poor puppy. But of course she doesn't have time to take the dog out. ,funny
