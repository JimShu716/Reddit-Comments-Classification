2338367,oh i looked at imdb at it said 2014- (no date) so i assumed its still ongoing :D great to know gonna watch it now :D,gameofthrones
2340763,I didn't watch to the point when she locked them up. Also what would Jorah do? Just tell her he used to be a spy out of nowhere? And I did not compare Joffrey to Dany that way. I am just saying they are both well written unlikeable characters.,gameofthrones
2344119,Why would he? That would just complicate things.,gameofthrones

2488253,You're assuming that Ned was known as an Honorable dude his entire life. It wasn't until after the war that his reputation preceded him. No one knew anything about Ned other than he was one of the last of the Starks and that he was looking to avenge his family. Starks were never known for their honor. Ned only was because he grew up with the knights of the Vale and picked up a few things.,gameofthrones

2503119,"Also the fact that in the early seasons she talks about how it's just because of sexism that people won't let her rule... And the show is like \""yeah she was right all along\"" feels almost silly",gameofthrones

2575871,The only one that really jumps out is the scene where it flips from Bran's first vision of Lyanna and baby Jon to Jon sitting at the high table at Winterfell. An obvious one but the swell of the score mixed with that final note of determination and resonance on the closeup of Jon's determined face is just beautifully done.,gameofthrones

2602851,Danys story is basically learning to be a ruler and of course that realistically there will be innocent victims and mistakes,gameofthrones

2618589,To be fair a handheld lance probably wasn't going to work either.,gameofthrones
2622802,[deleted],gameofthrones
2636678,True but I believe the only reason she has claim to the throne in the first place is because she is the widow of the late king and all her children are dead so from a legal stand point I think she would have to still to claim house Baratheon because of the titles it held. \nI could be wrong. Honestly I figured they would have changed it to a lion too so it's either just an oversight (which I highly doubt) or it is because of how she has to manipulate the system in order to be the Queen. ,gameofthrones
