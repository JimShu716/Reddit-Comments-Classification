800334,One Piece doesn't need to be remade. The older episodes still hold up nicely and even got a HD remastered version. The pacing pre time-skip is decent and follows the manga closely. Maybe a condensed version of post time-skip would be nice like how DBZ got Kai. There's a lot that can be trimmed and touched up post time-skip but that will require a lot of work with the amount of episodes and for a series that is still ongoing. I don't see it happening now but I can see it in the future when the series is finished based on how popular the series is.

829296,I'm fairly certain that pirating is way more popular outside of the west and it is still very popular in the west as well. A lot of countries don't have access to all the anime on sites like CR/Netflix/Funi and are left with no other means. Also I would think not everyone would want English subs. Also not everyone feels like spending money on something they can get for free. And aren't other countries not as strict on piracy? There are probably tons of other reasons but pirating is big everywhere,anime

The previous generations were advance enough to the point that they could mass produce AI-controlled caretakers that can empathize not only with humans but also with wildlife. It looks like AI isn't an issue since if they are then we would see more droids like that walking around. I wonder if the war started because of dwindling resources?

I wanted to like this show and it has plenty of great moments but I felt like I had to slog through so much shit just to get to the good parts. I felt like it was an abusive relationship. Stringing me along through the bad parts for those fleeting good scenes. I just want more about Kosei and Kaori not entire episodes dedicated to side characters. \n\nTLDR: Kosei and Kaori are great but the rest of the cast drags it down to a 3/10\ufeff,anime

2736114,At the start I thought that having giant autonomous robots may have been going a bit too far off the sci-fi deep end for a show that's been *relatively* grounded but with how beautifully it conveyed its discussions about the nature of life I think it completely fit the series.

2744077,It feels like everyone who condemns it for the \u201chorrible relationship\u201d thinks that they are the only people who understand that the relationship is messed up and everyone else thinks it\u2019s super healthy.\n\nWhen in reality it\u2019s only them who are pretending that the show portrays it as a healthy relationship. The show has *explicitly* called the relationship messed up. Most people seem to understand that applying human morals to non-human beings and situations just doesn\u2019t work.,anime
