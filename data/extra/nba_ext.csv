87113,Again disagree. Idk if you were watching basketball during that time but there is a reason LA wanted to move on from him and it wasn\u2019t just because Howard was available.\n\nOn mobile atm but I distinctly remember people questioning whether Bynum even cared when he was younger. Tons of talk of \u201che has all the tools but does he want it\u201d. Couple that with what he did to Barea and you can see why \u201cfuture of the franchise\u201d isn\u2019t a distinction that should not have been handed to him.,nba

If you combine last year and this year so far he has gone 1 for 10 from three. He's a great defender though so I listed him as mixed but I think he'd be better as a full-time PF.,nba

127338,I've watched very little of this game so feel free to correct me but Simmons seems to make the right plays but the sixers overall look hamstringed without Embiid which makes sense.

132146,Melo ain\u2019t sayin no to $27M next year,nba
132253,Another factor is also time. If you hack Lonzo right away then it's like you're forcing Lonzo to shoot 1-2 seconds into their own shot-clock on every possession which gives your team more time during the game.,nba

204015,So the thing about vertical leap is that it doesn't mean squat for dunking in traffic. Notice how guys like LeBron/Westbrook can body defenders and still utilize the majority of their vertical leap to dunk? It's a combination of explosiveness and core stability/strength. One of the reasons why LeBron seems so stable when he takes off. He's almost never off balance.\n\nSure it means Pat can throw down a mean one on a fast break or when he has a clear path on an alley-oop but just solely looking at vertical and basing their ability to dunk in traffic is flawed. It's like solely looking at 0-60mph numbers for a car and saying that they would be great handling cars on the track. ,nba

215203,"Jeff \""Lebron James\"" Green with the slam",nba

215635,he fucking slipped ,nba
215769,"Why did I read this as \""LeBron James with the Ejection!\"" For real tho.",nba
216025,Understandable. When I watch national broadcasts I miss Fred\u2019s energy during the game.  Even if Fred wasn\u2019t a homer I\u2019d still love him.,nba

220666,Yeah but if you stop you\u2019ll lose all of that conditioning ,nba
220679,man I love IT,nba
220711,he literally smashed it away.. LeBron is too ferocious in this month..this W-strike has striked his regard for human life. he just would kill everybody.,nba

221454,Jaylen is having a pretty terrible game today. ,nba

221765,IT hasn't even played a game for us and I already love him lmao. Greatest hype man since Bazemore,nba
221814,He tweaked it on his own towards the end of the game. Saw it on tv,nba
221815,[deleted],nba
221888,he can sleep his way to 15-20/10 most nights but his constency on hitting those open 3's is pretty frustrating,nba
221970,Hahaha okay this is great,nba
222109,What\u2019s really impressive to me about lebron is he has yet to force a bad shot this game. They\u2019ve doubled him all game and he has just whipped it to the open guy or set up a guy with a hockey assist and doesn\u2019t care at all as long as they are winning. ,nba

225472,Apparently your comment is a downvote-able offense,nba
225631,Imagine if Melo played like Kyle Korver.,nba
225727,Everybody on the floor knew where LeBron was on that 3. They simply can't afford to guard him any closer from there,nba
225902,i mean thats pretty much lebron in a nutshell. only time he ever really forces a bunch of bad shots is at the end of games when it's basically over. i feel u tho his snap passes are crazy and it's insane how its pretty much impossible to trap him,nba

229263,Can we give Kevin love some muhfuckin respek? Dude is straight balling lately.,nba
229268,I'm assuming because they didn't pay for them. Season is 2 weeks longer now. TNT usually does Tues/Thurs games each week. Previously let's say TNT would air (random number) 100 games a year because they had 3 games a week. They still pay for 100 games but there's more weeks so they can't air the usual like 3 a week,nba
229322,Dario missed that free throw because he's never coming over,nba

I'm pretty sure all the refs got it right instead of them all being wrong. \n\nYou got undeserved free throws out of it anyway. Just move on \n\n,nba
311408,###LEFUCK YOU THREEEEEEEEEE,nba
311429,We played like shit without our best player and made it a game until the end. Nice effort from everyone except Bayless. Fuck you,nba

I sauced the ball to Kev and LeBron just spiked his layup back in his face\ud83d\ude02.  Later LeBron told me he actually was trying to bust his face up a bit so he would spend less time modeling and more time practicing. Kevin love got so mad cuz he thought LeBron was embarrassing him on his own turf. LeBron blocked him a second time a few minutes later and kev just packed his shit up and stormed off the court muttering about \u2018having the flu\u2019 and feeling a little off. Rumor has it that Kev got so stressed out about it that all his hair turned gray\ud83d\udc74\ud83c\udffb.....id still gobble his giblets if he wanted me too tho ,nba

364798,Same,nba
365065,Pg defense.\n\nLue couldn\u2019t even play Jose in the second half because Shroeder was eating him up. He had to put Lebron on him. This worked because Hawks have no one to beat the Cavs. \n\nThis is a huge problem for the Cavs imo and here\u2019s why. Let\u2019s say IT comes back and Cavs play the warriors in the finals. IT can\u2019t guard Curry and will get roasted. IT is probably worse than Jose defensively. If Shroeder can do what he did to Jose then Curry will absolutely destroy IT. Here\u2019s the problem.. Cavs can\u2019t put LeBron on Curry like they did to Schroeder tonight or Kemba the other game because he can\u2019t leave KD or else he will go off. Does Ty Lue bench IT like he did to Jose tonight and bring out a better defensive lineup?? This is why I never liked IT being traded to the Cavs. He\u2019s a liability defensively and if you bench him then what good is he? ,nba

371508,curry's averaging 6.6 fta per game this year and falls on nearly every jump shot and drive (to save his ankles) which makes him harder to ref imo. yeah he gets held off-ball but he doesn't deal with stuff like this and gets the benefit of the doubt more often on drives,nba
371526,I know why they wanted him in I thought it was still pretty messed up considering how much pain he was in and how he clearly didn't expect himself to come back in the game. The other reason is because the opposing coach gets to choose who shoots them in your place,nba

385768,You are pretty much just incorrect bro. Thats not something that a high school team does really. The pg will dribble it all the way up instead of advancing it like TP. The guy in Greens place would take a wasted dribble instead of swinging to Gasol instinctively.\n\nPerfect timing and recognition is hard to teach and is absolutely not the norm tbh. Its almost like how \u201ccommon sense\u201d isnt really that common all the time. Just because people *should* be able to do something doesnt mean they actually do it/know it,nba

PG13 is elite enough to be even more positive without Melo sucking up the remaining usage there would be. \n\nMelo could still come in and play 30 minutes and dominate against second units and help stagger the minutes more effectively and consistently. \n\nI'd say start Jerami Grant but that's a hell of a lot of bricks and bad spacing for a starting unit that already includes Roberson and your expected handful of not-on-fire Westy chucks. ,nba

508146,[removed],nba
508148,HE JUMP TOO HIGH THAT TIME!,nba
508175,Justin Holiday moving up the ranks of all time tank commanders. That foul on Bartons 28 foot three followed by his terrible missed three when Lopez was wide open down low. Then he just absolutely gave up on defense on the last possession to let Barton score. Another win in the columm for the tanking bulls.,nba
508203,Jesus Willie Reed is huge,nba
508230,my only issue is he's too unselfish \n\nhe doesn't take advantage of mismatches enough and defers to lesser offensive players like smart ,nba

578682,What? He's been back for 6 games and we're 6-0 in that stretch.,nba
578730,Lebron definitely get the short end of the stick with foul calls. Shooting 10 ft a game has more to do with play style than flopping. If Curry drove to the basket as much as Harden he would average just as many free throws.,nba
578734,It\u2019s a good thing he wouldn\u2019t have to be playing in the Triangle then I guess. ,nba

665022,I think the disparity has always been that the 5 best times in the NBA were Warriors / Spurs / Clippers / Rockets &amp; the Cavs.   Before the KD signing you could replace the Rockets with the  Thunder.\n\nNow the Clippers have dropped hard out of that picture.  Grizzlies and Thunder not even in the consideration.  The Top 6 teams are more equal now and the league is a lot more fun this way.  I don't think seeds 5-8 in the West are noticeably better than the seeds 5-8 in the east.\n,nba

The gap from Giannis (1) vs Lebron (2) is bigger than Lebron  (2) vs Gobert (12th) so if anything for how many attempts he makes he doesn't get enough fouls if we use that logic.\n\nObviously eyewitness and context can provide a different image but  i have seen a lot of Bucks and Giannis this year to know that he isn't getting superstar calls.,nba
721881,completely killed our momentum... good job refs on ruining another game,nba

799196,I've watched most of the games LeBron has played in his career and fully appreciate how amazing he is playing right now. It's nice to see other people who understand how crazy it is. How has Harden been this season? I really hope LeBron gets another mvp this year and Harden seems most likely to win over him. I like harden as a person but hate his game and flailing for calls. ,nba

799626,Oladipo??,nba
799913,Feel like u can't judge D Wade on a per 36 scale. If he actually played 36 min he'd be go gassed and his stats would prolly only go down,nba
800026,Disagree. That was the narrative. And it affected him visibly over the course of his OND season. He should\u2019ve come right out and called for the ball. Be the man like Bagley at the moment. ,nba

He learned to hit jumpers consistently( since 2012 id say) he works on his 3 every year and he isn\u2019t play reckless basketball based on his strength.

891319,His defensive rating for that finals was 109.7 and that's damn good? Yes IT was the worst defensive PG last season but Kyrie was the 2nd worst defensive PG last year and the Celtics were one of the worst defensive rebounding teams in the league last year this year the young guys they have make the Celtics one of the better defensive rebounding teams in the league (6th in DRB vs 26th last year) what does that translate to? Less 2nd chance opportunities for the opposing PG to score. In addition to that if you look at defensive ratings for most players on a team its about the same for most. Kyrie is still getting blown by at a pretty regular rate the difference this year is the defenders behind him are much better at protecting the rim and playing pick and roll defense than Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson. Am I saying IT is a better player or defender than Kyrie absolutely not but the difference is nowhere near as large as you make it out to be.,nba

923652,Ive seen him play like ass against Utah multiple times and even in other games he hasn't shown anything defensively tbh and just seems too slow. He often has open looks but really hesitates and it can be frustrating to see.,nba
923785,81st,nba
924148,Lmao how can you say he wasn't gonna be a generational talent? Were you even alive and old enough to see him play in college? Is dirk a generational talent he didn't go first what about Kobe? If Kobe died before he ever played you probably would have said the same thing because Vitaly potapenko got picked before him. It's all hypothetical's there have been as many draft busts as superstars. It just sucks that we never got to find out if he was or not.,nba

925566,He was Tyreke Evans on steroids but super explosive along with great vision. Sorta like a mini Magic too as he was always a showman. Shaq said that Shaq and Penny was Shaq and Kobe before Shaq and Kobe. Lol.

930737,His book.,nba
930759,For real though I think LeBron is the more dominant player for his sport but Brady putting together an MVP season at 40 playing the most difficult position in sports is maybe one of the greatest athletic feats of all time. Nobody is really talking about it because it's so normal but if there was still any about whether or not Brady is the GOAT I think this season has ended that conversation. ,nba

930992,I think one thing is Hoiberg is actually a really good shooting coach and has really helped Dunn\u2019s jump shot. The form and mechanics are looking a lot better and he now has an elbow jumper on the left side of the ft line he\u2019s settling for a lot and his 3 point shot looks pretty good when he gets in rhythm.

946515,he hasn't really had the opportunity to choke in the playoffs as a number 1 option tbh. I mean i could bring up a missed free throw from 2013 but thats unfair. He was thoroughly outplayed by durant in the 2016 wcsf and did not show up in the clutch then. Also last years playoffs he was great but didn't play the closeout game vs the rockets and didn't get to play that series against the warriors. \n\nAt this current point its unfair to judge harden who has had years of being the first option vs kawhi who has had like 2. Plus i hate the clutch argument when it comes to players. ,nba

948830,Yeah I should've been more specific and said his prime or the majority of it. ,nba
948860,I think you mean to say that the Thunder were 46-34 when Westbrook was chasing triple doubles. Obviously they're going to lose more of the games their historic-usage-rate-having player doesn't play well.,nba

954833,Ya because Noah wasn't also running the #1 offense in the league.  Draymond was DPOY while also orchestrating the offense.  He's the guy yelling all the plays and telling players where to go on both sides of the floor.  He does that while also being the best defender.  ,nba

956074,he's really not as bad as this sub says ,nba
956389,He's been way better than expected for anyone but himself. He's slower than usual but he's playing with his head high and running the offense efficiently which is incredible for this team as they've been lacking this kind of PG for months now.,nba

998942,Why are we acting like an unstoppable shot is good??,nba
998945,That's definitely the difference imo. Harden has been pedal to the metal since day 1. LeBron took his sweet time to get rolling (including a very bad loss streak).,nba
999179,Why 30 dollars a month? I'm (although in Europe) am paying 12.99 EUR (which is like 15-16 dollars) a month for a monthly subscription. And that's more expensive than the yearly one..,nba

1002915,How would he have fared against Jordan in the pros? I've heard people say that he would've prevented Jordan from winning titles.,nba
1003367,There's nothing low key about that. It's more like Kingdom Hearts keyblade levels of key where he smashes you in the face with it.,nba
1003617,My main point is I don't agree with his valuation. Espn and SI rate him as a top 10 player. Nearly every media outlet rates him at top 15. These outlets contain employees that are associated with the league and are influential in voting. They influence a lot of casual fans.,nba
1005097,Take it from someone who\u2019s seen both of them - Burke isn\u2019t any better than Sessions. He\u2019s slower and can\u2019t even get the ball up the court half the time,nba

1007648,Well yeah in terms of pure coaching ability of course. That's not what the award is though. The Blazers have greatly outperformed their expectations defensively and both CJ &amp; Dame (CJ in particular) are improved defensively. They are second in the league in DRtg this year. No one saw that coming. There is absolutely an argument for Stotts to be in the conversation.,nba

1021824,As of right now Curry has the highest peak of any shooter. It's only since like 3 years ago max that people started saying he could be the best shooter ever. Not that I think he won't sustain it but Korver has been doing it his whole career. If for some reason Curry just nosedives to like 35% from 3 for the rest of his career is he a better 3pt shooter still? Idk if that % difference would be close enough to justify it. Once again though I totally do not expect this to happen.,nba

You don't know how significant the height prior is. You don't know how they weigh each rate stat in their statistical analysis. \n\nMy suspicion is they rely heavily on AST% which is why Porzingis was low even in his hot start and why Cousins continues to be high. \n\nThe only 2 people who for sure know how you get from RAPM to RPM is Jerry and Steve. ,nba
1174835,Ah the Harden...ugly,nba
1174965,I never said he was consensus best center. The reason he wasn't is because he could never sustain his health long enough. When he was healthy and at his best he was the best though. Feel free to go check the numbers h2h with any center in the league. Nobody could stop him. Not Shaq. Not Dwight. Nobody.,nba
1175688,I think it is fair to call him a 3/4 option and it not be hate towards him.  Who wouldn't be a 3/4 option on that team outside of Lebron?  He fits that system so well and there is nothing wrong with sticking to your role.  He sets the tone on that court and every normal basketball fan knows that.,nba

He just glances at the rim while 3 feet behind the arc and a lane just magically opens up for him. That head fake is like saying get the fuck over here and gaurd me no matter how deep the shot would be. Ez to get to the hole If people are running at you behind the arc.\n\nAnd we all remember Lebrons cocky 3 pointer on ibaka last playoffs. Dude spins the ball a couple of times in his hand because he knows 1 jab step will give him space to launch his shot. His jab step is another way of saying get the fuck off me and players do because they dont want to get dunked on.,nba

1752630,Even after that last chapter? :P,nba
1752875,It was by us last playoffs.  Will have to wait and see this year with the addition of CP3.,nba
1753459,Why do they need to dominate when they're on at the same time? Anderson and Gordon are both equally good at shooting as Harden/CP3 so you'd waste 2 point guard's energies for no reason. It's more efficient to stagger their minutes so 2 of the best shooters in the league have 1 of the 2 of the best point guards to pass them the ball. They don't need to play together. This is probably why their +/- is low when they play together because Dantoni plays them together less than other teams starting line up.,nba
1753590,DeRozan,nba
1753853,He's a parody of himself now. He needs someone to check him. He doesn't have that now being away from espn. Everyone at the ringer is just his underling and they all sound like mini Bill Simmons. It's gross.,nba
1754033,still lost to the raps tho,nba
1755325,Damn it haha,nba
1755500,Sorry that\u2019s incorrect.  Steph makes his teammates better more than Lebron and the WOWY stats prove that. ,nba
1755688,[deleted],nba
1756311,Lol simmons is already a better PG ,nba
1756395,He won't. You can't create a championship caliber team around his playstyle. He dominates the ball too much and will always need to be the center of attention. Maybe he wins one as a bench guy in his mid-30s who knows but not as a star player.,nba
1756589,Loved seeing that smile from him at UM.  He's a good kid.,nba

I was pissed (reasonably so) at a horrible call and having to hear some biased bucks announcers make it worse. Never said anything about Gianni's or the bucks so STFU ,nba
2216642,Because he's not just some spot up center. He has post skills high and low. He's just not being used right in an offense that wants to get out and run. In the halfcourt offense he's not getting many post touches and we do have a couple chuckers on the team so ball movement isn't that good. ,nba
2217322,[removed],nba
2217375,Lol I wish there was a stat that tracked how many rebounds a player steals. Glad that Lowe noticed how damn good Demarre is at sneaking those rebounds away. He's definitely right that we should've been able to get a pick for Crabbe but I think Marks saw unloading that Nicholson contract as enough of a trade off. It was really only a 12 million$ cap hit that way. ,nba

The threat of Kyrie scoring is enough to help his team even if his shot isn\u2019t falling. It\u2019s s big reason Al Hordford gets so many wide open 3\u2019s. Kyrie dances past his man and the help steps up and Kyrie kicks it to the open man. \nCurry is the best point guard in the league. How much does he contribute when his shot isn\u2019t falling,nba

2295080,Another thing that is probably not measurable in the stats is the time between Ryno getting an open shooting window and CP3 getting the ball to him.\n\nA lot of times shooters are primed and in rhythm right as the play has developed. CP3 is great at getting guys their shots in rhythm especially off of PnR action.\n\nPaul getting the ball to Anderson at the RIGHT time (not trying to anticipate the play too early tipping off the defense or holding it for too many dribbles) probably helps him get those shots off in rhythm,nba

2301228,why the fuck is a guy from the 2016 draft class considered a rookie this season?\n\nfor the fucking life of me i don't understand that rule. didn't get it when blake won ROTY,nba
2301602,I love Ben but this is not as impressive as it sounds. How many young players are given a big enough role to rack up assists plus that class is hot garbage ,nba
2301859,he was great on the sixers--he practically transformed them from a team that couldn't win to a team that could compete. but i guess they were still doing the process so they let him walk.,nba

2302223,It\u2019s not like you can fine a ref for missing a call because they\u2019re human and monetary punishment for what is most times human error would be ridiculous. Refs get graded and evaluated throughout the year and the best refs get the opportunity to earn much more for officiating playoff games. That\u2019s a natural incentive to prevent repeated mistakes,nba

2304723,Calling Kyrie overrated is certainly not egregious but to do it on the platform of his handles and finishing around the rim is absolute absurdity.,nba
2304734,I've watched him since he was elite.  He's declined greatly.  He'll continue to decline this season as his body breaks down.  I'd be surprised if he's averaging 15 minutes a game in the playoffs.  Because of how much he's declined.,nba

2305222,why is Kyle Kuzma who had the benefit of playing 2 more years in college considered a rookie? \n\nwhy did Malcolm Brogdon who played 4 more years in college than the one and dones be considered a rookie? \n\nwhy is Doncic who has played professional basketball for 4 seasons be considered a rookie next year? ,nba

2313123,He needs better. Dude said he was cold blooded in his post game interview. I\u2019ve never stanned harder for such an obscure and random player. ,nba
2313404,It makes them easier to defend in the playoffs. Which is how the Spurs were able to beat them in 6 games. \nIt's difficult to stop in the season because teams don't really have too much time to figure out a game plan and to practice it so the rockets offensive system wins against unprepared teams. ,nba

2326465,Just because Kyrie does fancy dribbling moves that looks aesthetically pleasing doesn't mean he's the fkin MVP ,nba
2326576,Harden initiates most of the contact as well. Difference is he snaps his head back and wails his arms to get calls,nba
2326716,would you say its a whopper?,nba
2326741,It wasn\u2019t though. You said it yourself. He didn\u2019t play. When was Dario Saric\u2019s rookie year? 2014 when he was drafted and still in Europe? Or 2016 when he started playing in the NBA?,nba

The nets offered a team based incentive that the nets would clearly not trigger (it was a bonus for winning games) and the rockets correctly decided to not include that in his deal since it was a bonus written for the nets performance.

Malone is hardly perfect(and Emmanuel Mudiay is an ex of player develoment not working out) nad perfectly isolating his role in their development is very hard. But Denver's coaching staff in particular came to mind for me. \n\nI also think they have gotten more out of Jamal Murray at his age at this point than I might have expected when he was drafted. ,nba

2489051,What exactly would Kerr bring? Lue coaches the team extremely well after watching them. He is one of the best in game managers in the league cause he trusts his team and isn't beholden to rotations. I saw him against us run the bench for 8 straight minutes and have them turn a deficit into a 10 point lead. He will stop playing Love and Crowder if they aren't doing well,nba
2489529,You\u2019re right. He would\u2019ve been way better than Kyrie ,nba
2489568,Make mid range great again. ,nba
2489635,I don\u2019t care what words come out of his mouth. Especially when talking to the press. I care about how he plays b-ball. He\u2019s a top 5 player in the league.  ,nba

2493660,Kobe Bean Bryant ,nba
2493933,Do you really think that's not debatable? ,nba
2494230,Not to knock on Kerr's abilities but it's a lot easier to experiment with rotations when your second string lineup is better than some actual teams,nba

2497871,#15STRONG\n\n2006 heat slogan when they won the ship,nba

2498611,TMac never won a playoff series as a starter. PP had many big playoff games and was Finals MVP.,nba
2499198,I lived in a house with 7 other dudes my junior year and it was basically drama free. Small discussions about cleaning/not leaving shit lying around etc. But no major issues at all. Reading stuff on here makes me think that year was some sort of twilight zone incident.,nba
2499213,That hypothetical team will probably get gassed pretty early without any subs. ,nba
2499274,Warriors.  That team may score 120 points but they'll give up 160 doing it.,nba
2499282,I disagree. He would have been doing this shit last year too. The difference is he\u2019s a generational talent ,nba

2501529,Maybe keep your observations to yourself because moderation creep has begun in full force.,nba
2501534,I'd rather bet on the guys that clearly have the skills and just need refinement. Lonzo needs a factory reset before I even think of imagining him being a not negative. ,nba

2514167,I know that his potential would be wasted but having Jokic on the Warriors would be crazy. The Warriors favorite way to start the offense is a low post split and when Bogut was still with us he was one of our primary distributers. Having Jokic passing during those sets would be insane.,nba

2515016,I didn't say he was going to win the MVP. I said you can make a case for him being a top 15 player.,nba
2515191,I think the main comparison was because AD and Robinson are normally pretty level headed dudes while their more unstable teammates ended up being in the opposite positions to them than normal lol,nba
2515335,Nothing like kicking back and listening to the soothing sounds of The Exorcist theme song. Lol.,nba
2515495,Game 1 2001 NBA Finals. Allen Iverson's between the legs step back jumper over Tyron Lue. Then proceeded to step over him while he was on the ground. Still bitter we got swept after that game 1 win in LA,nba

2518926,plz bb,nba
2519186,Not if it was just instinctual to catch the ball after it was made/the ball falls right to the player. It was tweaked a little because the game was delayed even more by dudes literally letting it bounce off them into the crowd and stuff because they didn't want to touch it. ,nba

2548767,Allowing challenges and slowing the game would solve real problems because there have been games that were decided on bad calls. Just off the top of my head there were two Raptor games last year that were close but ended with the Raptors losing both of them due to bad officiating.  And for a better example Horry's hip check on Nash that cost the Suns in the playoffs? \n\nAnd yeah one regular season game it doesn't 'matter' too much but what if that one game cost them the Playoff spot? What if the refs had mistakenly called a foul on LeBron's block on Iggy during Game 7? That hypothetical bad call could have changed the outcome of the series and championship.  If challenges were implemented that wouldn't happen. The Kings might have went to the Finals instead of the Lakers back in 2002 if it weren't for all those shady calls that went unchallenged.\n\nI would rather have a slower but more accurate game than a rushed and sloppy one.,nba

2643444,Smart.  Dude should play to his strengths.,nba
2643591,Don\u2019t listen to that guy. He a tool,nba
2643596,Talking about his show. I don't trust him to put together anything better than a mildly interesting podcast. I'd love to be wrong though,nba
2643697,What kind of answer do you expect? He\u2019s going to say he\u2019s focused on his team and this year. ,nba

2654658,When he was asked about it during preseason that was basically his exact answer,nba
2655060,"\""I have to stop and cum\""",nba
2655321,Cause no matter what he says people will hold it against him when he actually makes the decision. So the only thing he can say without getting shit on is this.,nba
2655342,Dude. I know he struggles and is streaky. I watch every game and I'm not blind. But his defense is some of the best in the league. Even when he can't score he contributes and earns his starting spot. If you don't realize that you don't understand basketball. He is also still young despite being in the league for a bit. Covington is a steal and if you're going to dwell some streakiness than jump ship.,nba
2655475,Those four back-to-back ACC games in March were so nuts. You see so many NBA teams look flat on the second night of a back to back but Tatum just would not be denied for four consecutive nights. Even though I don't really care for Duke I could tell that he was special.,nba

2656860,that is already happening to us that is why we never get big time recruits. adding Witchita state is only delaying the slow decline. ACC would be huge for us. That Syracuse and Duke rivalries would rescue us for sure. It sucks because we have real recent championship pedigree but every year we sink more and more into obscurity .,nba

2690164,Otto and Beal are both young and expected to improve - which I also talked about. Beal has been underwhelming. I don't see how 46 wins and a 5th or 6th place finish isn't regressing for a young 49 win team who was 4th in the East last year.\n\nAre expectations for this team not to be top 4 at least?

2690722,9-5 with Wall is a much better pace than 2-3 without. I don\u2019t think they really have to worry. They might be underperforming slightly but that\u2019s just because people had very high expectations of them this season. ,nba

2757657,And people said this during the summer league games.  He had awful shot mechanics that looked like it would not work as well against NBA vets running NBA defensive schemes.  He was shooting 38% in summer league which I wouldn't call savage.  He's shooting 31% now.\n\nEdit: I'm also very high on Lonzo and think he has been very good during the season and thought he was very good during summer league.  If you thought he was shooting well during summer league though then you really weren't watching.,nba

2758984,Actually surprised Jakob's WS/48 are the best but I guess he does a lot really well even if he doesn't get a ton of minutes yet. Siakam with the third highest per 48 is also pretty awesome. I remember I was shocked we got him over Skal but he looks like he is turning out as a nice steal in the late first round. \n\nIngram stil has a ways to go but dude is definitely much improved statistically compared to last year. Really rooting for the guy.\n\nWould be cool to see how dudes like Fred VanVleet stack up with advanced stats. His shooting has been mediocre but his defense has been a great surprise for a ~6 foot guard,nba

2803434, &gt;Part of me thinks Pop doesn't even try to win regular season basketball games unless it's really close late in the 4th.  The winning is a side-product of developing players and schemes.  He takes the long-view of developing his players to ready them for as many possible situations in the playoffs as possible.  He's not the only coach to do this but it wasn't long ago in the NBA at all that benches were considered fairly inconsequential in the playoffs.  Now they are cornerstones of contending teams because guys like Dan Tony and Pop realized how shuffling new players in with their own skillset could disrupt set defenses.\n\nKerr definitely copies Pop strategy on this.

2852356,"&gt;Lebron's production has not dipped enough to draw a circle around a few years then call it his \""prime\"" then compare. He's been destroying the East for a decade and your post hones in on a couple of series and relies on the fact that Lebron's worst one was marginally worse than Kobe's?\n\nI picked just 2nd round or further.\n\n&gt;Let me remind you that your thesis is that \""Kobe is a more consistent playoff performer than Lebron\"" so the idea that picking and choosing random series to compare makes this absolute nonsense.\n\nRight I just happened to pick his very bad series as a coincidence.\n\n&gt;Lebron leads all players in points and win shares all time whereas Kobe is 4th and 8th respectively. I'm well aware those are imperfect stats but when measuring **consistency** picking two specific series not at random is nowhere near as valuable as the lifetime stats from a statistical analysis perspective. \n\nAs an aggregate Lebron might be more impactful(which I think is false) but Kobe is still more consistent. Which is what im arguing about here ",nba

2855780,Timberwolves makes sense. Taj isn't a permanent solution at the 4 and KAT is never going to be able to anchor a defense. Biting the bullet and just letting him get burnt on the perimeter by PF's might be worth it to have actual rim protection and help defense down low.,nba

2866374,Defense: BE LONGER ,nba
2866477,&gt;Part of me thinks Pop doesn't even try to win regular season basketball games unless it's really close late in the 4th. The winning is a side-product of developing players and schemes. He takes the long-view of developing his players to ready them for as many possible situations in the playoffs as possible. He's not the only coach to do this but it wasn't long ago in the NBA at all that benches were considered fairly inconsequential in the playoffs. Now they are cornerstones of contending teams because guys like Dan Tony and Pop realized how shuffling new players in with their own skillset could disrupt set defenses.\n\nWell I kind of disagree with the first part. I think it's just that the spurs are much more disciplined than most teams and value continuity such that just by their fundamentals the spurs almost always win. It goes far to have all your players be smart on defense and not foul\n,nba
