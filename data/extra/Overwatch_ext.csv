92494,I know games with less devs that balance better and know what they are doing and communicate better. \n\nBlizzard is shit lol. ,Overwatch

103523,No I use 75/75 but I would try a few different ones and see what works,Overwatch
104257,Oh you must've joined comp. Just kidding if you are playing in qp that's kinda how it is sometimes most people use QP as a test grounds of sorts to try out new characters most of which they are bad at.,Overwatch

107286,I\ufe0f was always of the opinion that Junkrat was in an amazing spot despite people saying that he\u2019s virtually unplayable in comp.  then he got that second mine which encouraged people to actually learn how to play him and now he\u2019s OP and ppl realize how he was always fine to begin with. ,Overwatch

109395,But it lacks any proper countermeasures to handle losing strikes. It's supposed to help you climb back but it doesn't do that as the way it does it is by lowering your sr loss and boosting your sr gain. Issue with that is that matchmaking is so bad especially if you're climbing the ladder that the small losses stack and the wins just aren't consistent enough to pull you back up. ,Overwatch
109711,If you look closely he gets trapped at the very last frame of the gif,Overwatch
110780,is genjis base movement speed increased when he's ulting?,Overwatch
111378,It does the same thing for losing streaks. It will start to increase your gains and lower your losses the lower you go.,Overwatch
112526,Nope,Overwatch
113251,And as I pointed out that's not sufficient as matchmaking is just bad.,Overwatch
113535,real blunt and honest as a healer main and the must have a mercy in your party crap in comp cause rez was op this being  before the patch adding cast time to her.  i was getting real bored of overwatch (mercy is boring to me i preffered ana).  moira really speaks to my playstyle and im having massive fun playing her.  soooooo the patch stopped me from giving up on the game.,Overwatch

125147,1000%,Overwatch
125801,moira instills grouping up mass healing and orbs work better if you team up and for damage orbs coming in if the party groups up then the damage orb is weak 200/6 is better than 200/3.  i wouldnt worry about it giving her ult charge tbh as her ult charges bloody fast anyway. take the small damage divided against your team quick puff from your moira or a nade from ana and its like it didnt happen.,Overwatch

136282,this!  i enjoy doing this i love doing it to tracer too.  she blinks away and around a corner to hind then poof i appear beside her and orb and drain the last of her existence.  thou shall stand and fight and die or run and die but you challenge me you will die.\n\nbeing an anti flanker support is fun i no longer feel vulnerable as a healer main.\n,Overwatch

138928,I'm sorry to repeat posting and deleting. I have not done much posting by Reddit.,Overwatch

141702,[deleted],Overwatch
142046,I prefer a boop.,Overwatch
142430,The difference is that Ana had a hitscan gun everyone else you talked about is projectile so it harder to do damage constantly with them. If she sleeps a flanker she can now kill them by herself. I think she is fine without headshots.,Overwatch
142459,Lilac and gooseberries ,Overwatch
142724,Oh there is no free pass for four months of no answer. That's terrible as well in my eyes. If there was small fixes over time that would be ideal. But ignoring it or just saying that you know are equally awful ideas. Act on it.,Overwatch

151274,Yeah its weird because some games I'll play against 2-3 star people and the next everyone is less than 30,Overwatch
151775,Even with 400 up-votes this is a under appreciated post,Overwatch
152075,Such a cute betrayal :D,Overwatch
152208,They cant really measure play of the game by honour can they? This is fucking tear shedding and fucking hilariously awesome,Overwatch
152579,You are where you belong. Ignore the roll of the dice at the beginning of the game or your equal chance of having throwers. It will fix itself as long as you solo carry back to where you belong. The system is perfect. ,Overwatch
153331,Everyone in the game should get that voiceline for whenever your Rein does something stupid,Overwatch
154135,Make a big post like the Doomfist guy did. The devs seem to pay attention to those.,Overwatch
154739,That isn\u2019t how the hidden MMR works. MMR and SR are supposed to be as close as possible. SR allows for more volatile swings and MMR takes more games to make adjustments. \n\nI think a better reason is simply that higher SR people probably play way more comp than QP. There just aren\u2019t enough of them for the system to create a balanced QP match. ,Overwatch

158282,Oh there\u2019s no denying that I\u2019m just saying it\u2019d be tight as fuck if she could do that. I know there\u2019s balance issues with anything regarding movement and with some tuning it could work and be balanced with benefits to gameplay. Maybe it\u2019s an active ability like Lucios team speed boost and your teammates can also run over it and give it a longer cool down and the frost on the floor is only possible in that time frame then disappears after x seconds. ,Overwatch
158488,There's already been multiple threads explaining the fundamentals of QAs and the difference with Blizzard's home testing and those of multiple different individuals with their own nuanced and subjective experience.\n\nAlso there is such a thing as writing a book and having your readers help you edit it. It's called beta readers. Don't just make up random bs to support your case that you know nothing about internally.,Overwatch

160467,The only way to get better at aiming is to keep practicing. Its muscle memory. Remember that a lot of people at your rank might be good at aiming which gives them an advantage even if they make worse decisions.\n\nThere are videos on youtube showing you how to set up bots to practice aiming.\n\nEDIT: also don't just play every hero. Stick with 1 for now and learn the core mechanics of that hero. After you are more comfortable try out someone else. ,Overwatch

167383,I dont think a keyboard and mouse is going to make me a better player. Alot of my friends use $1 microsoft mouse and are quickly rising the ranks. I used a normal stock keyboard and stock mouse and im rising. I dont think I need a razer deathadder which costs like half of my cpu to get good. I heard these were budget but still good. I checked reviews. I'm not gonna get a mechanical keyboard but ill go for something similar but cheaper.,Overwatch

220704,okay. \n\nso your friend climbed from level 1 to level 25. then you placed with HIS MMR. \n\nquickplay MMR is different from comp MMR. people don't try as hard. different environments. diamond/master/GM/top 500 can all share similar quickplay MMR and queue together. \n\njust because he was queuing with GM in quickplay doesn't make him one. \n\nif you read my explanation in the link. you would understand why you placed in plat. 10 games is not enough to shift your MMR to the point of drastic change. \n\ndespite YOU playing in the 10 games. it was still not enough to get him to place above plat. you could have lost all 10 games. won all 10 games. ANYBODY could have played on that account. \n\nhe still would have placed in plat. because that was where his MMR was. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n,Overwatch

316659,NO. This has been asked before but it wont work for many reasons. First how would if feel to lose because someone joined the enemy team that filled a hole they had before for example a team of 5 DPS mains and a Tank main a DPS leave and are replaced by a support main. There overall team comp is now stronger even if the player is at the same skill level. Second what if the joiner is a troll or is someone that grossly unbalances the match. In my opinion that would be worse than a 5 v 6. Lastly it will create SR inflation by people only gaining and never losing SR.,Overwatch

Im currently 3337 sr as I type this. 163 sr off of masters.  I didn't make this post to brag but to let you guys know DON'T GIVE UP! Practice makes perfect as cheesy as it sounds its true.

407754,This is definitely just a bug,Overwatch
408480,its 20 meters. \n\npeople don't complain about it as much as symmetra because:\n\n- it does a flat 50 damage. its pretty low damage. \n\n- it has a much more strict aim requirement. its a bit forgiving but its no where near like symmetra's where you can be a good portion away from target and its still locked on. \n\n- it does not have a grace period like symmetra/mercy. \n\n- symmetra's beam has a grace period of 0.5 seconds. sym's beam hits targets 4 times per second. so her grace period is 2 instances of damage. at max charge. that grace period = 60 damage. mercy has the same thing with a grace period of TWO seconds so she heals an extra 120 hp when breaking LoS/range etc. moira doesn't have a grace period. the moment it breaks LoS/range or you stop using ability. the ability ends. symmetra on the other hand is not able to manually stop her laser. her laser will finish 0.5 seconds of damage before it changes targets. which is why changing targets in a clumped fight with symmetra is hard. you have to physically stop firing and have the beam completely stop before you can target someone else. ,Overwatch

Try too see how they react to situations and take from their play learning the basics and form your own plays and style off of it no need to feel like you have to copy them perfectly. Play a lot of quick play to get used to the feel of your hero and study other characters cd's and ultimate charge times. Make sure you are well informed on whats going on around you. Time will help build you mechanical play and when your used to the game I would start thinking about games sense and ways to further the basics.,Overwatch

434083,Because who needs to switch to pistol?,Overwatch
434379,If people were constantly saying that Doomfist is broken you would think the devs of the game would look into it and find out that there are some major problems with the hero. Instead they have to have someone spoon feed them everything. \n\nThe balance team for Overwatch is laughable and one of the main reasons that Overwatch is not as good as it could be. So many examples of them just deleting a hero from the game or making them overwhelmingly powerful. It like they don't even play their own game sometimes.,Overwatch
434562,Her beam latching on to friendly Mei walls definitely affects gameplay. I've died a few times trying to kill a squishy because my beam kept latching on friendly Mei walls.\n\nThe clipping of her veil is a bug because it's not meant to do that. They have actually tried to address this before but they didnt do a good job on it. And they do look at little stuff like this all the time btw I see it in the patch notes lol.\n\nI consider the dragon voicelines a bug because they are in the game and they worked when you made a custom junkenstein's revenge but not when the skin is equipped. I'm sure they made the voices for the skin and somehow they just aren't connected to the skin.\n\nI doubt the removal charge on Mei walls is intentional. It happened around the time they introduced junkertown. Symmetra for some reason could charge her weapon on the junkertown bike. They tried to remove that but may have removed her charge from Mei walls in the process by mistake. Kinda like how Lucio lost his momentum when they removed the Mercy glide bug.,Overwatch

462677,He is still used quite often in high tier ranked games. In the past he took a pretty heavy damage nerf but was given an extra shot and faster rate of fire. He was given a 50% damage reduction during his heal and can move during it as well which to my knowledge enemies are given less ult charge during his heal as a result of the damage reduction. If you walk forward at the enemy you hook you get closer increasing damage dealt and finish off with a melee attack to get a max damage combo to burst hero's down quickly. He is still a character worthy of high tier Overwatch. ,Overwatch

526302,I'd suggest focusing on the hero's you play against certain hero's. Which ways can you outplay those hero's and pay attention to which ones have skills that can be dangerous for you. If that's the case try to pay attention for when they use that skill and go in after an example being you're Genji with dragon blade and you know Ana has bio nade available. I would suggest waiting for that to be used to use blade in most situations so you can get healed while using it and get the most value out of your play. Simple outplays and tricks can be highly effective against players that don't  pay attention to everything. As for aim that's mechanical skill and to get better maybe try practicing in custom games or deathmatch where you're constantly fighting people in different positions moving at random and try to get better at tracking/flicking at them. ,Overwatch

Try to line up the enemies and teammates to get maximum value out of it as it also heals teammates making the fight easier because your team is getting healed as well as you are helping kill the enemy in front of them. \n\nI'm not sure on what settings are best for sensitivity on Xbox one as i'm a PC player I would just up it little bits at a time until you feel good about it.\n\nI think you mean Mei when talking about ice walls. I would use it for many things for example if an enemy Roadhog hooks a teammate you can put a wall up in between them keeping it from going through. You can effectively use wall anywhere to split enemies up and cut them off from running away. Or use it in a gravaton for example and put it up in front of your team blocking the enemies from following it up.,Overwatch

713922,What?,Overwatch
714368,I think the problem with Mercy is that she is in a way back to where she started. Her ult is very strong and she is reliant on it to make a big impact. If they further nerf her ult without otherwise buffing her she will become a liability compared to other healers. The problem is there is no real room for buffing without rework imo in her kit as Mercy meta has shown.,Overwatch
715375,i'm almost a support main who floats low gm/high master and i get killed on the regular by players like 1000 sr lower than me when i play ffa. my ~50 hours on tracer in qp and on my plat dps smurf are usually no match for a 200 hour mccree main even if he's in a way lower rank :( ,Overwatch
715580,Just curious but do you smoke cigarettes? ,Overwatch
716314,It could even be a reverse hybrid point too! You start it off like a payload map where you push the cart but come to a place where the payload had to conduct research. You then have to do a cp point and fully invest researching that area to move it to the next point and so on. It would be really cool to see blizzard break off from the norm,Overwatch

806763,I would say I see them quite frequently and most players tend to know which ults combo and save them for stuff like grav. The Zarya tends to make calls for bubbles and ults allowing other players to keep track of them.

1199539,"Mercy Res cast time and speed debuff still aren't sitting well with me. Being a sitting duck for 1.75 seconds is proving to be fatal far too often. Optimal conditions for a Res are now either away from battle or with shielding from teammates. \n\nDeaths almost always occur in the heat of battle so it isn't very realistic to think you'll be casually resurrecting people from the safety of cover most of the time. Pulling off a res with shielding is often worse as your team is then down 1) the dead hero 2) your shield tank and 3) your healer.  Being that Doomfist is being prepped to return to the meta and any melee can ignore shields the whole \""shield and res\"" thing is going to lead to a lot of free double kills (dead hero + stationary Mercy. Bonus triple if you can take out the tank getting no heals that tried to shield Mercy).\n\nI think the speed debuff needs to go or be greatly reduced and the resurrect radius needs to increase enough to allow Mercy a chance at dodging incoming attacks while casting. I'd like to avoid a situation where Mercy falls out of meta so far that Blizz adding Moira becomes more of a main healer *replacement* than an addition.",Overwatch

1302989,They still need something to go off of. It doesnt have to be as detailed as that post but you need to provide examples of the issue so they can reproduce the conditions and provide fixes. Something as simple as just s single screen recording of the issue happening that can be somewhat reproducible. It's not tough nowadays to do this either since everyone has some sort of screen recording software on pc and xbox and ps4 both do it natively.,Overwatch

1323871,It\u2019s not common in news. These guys are saying it\u2019s common because they\u2019ve seen names and titles on a tv screen before and can\u2019t tell the difference between that and what overwatch is doing. \n\nThe format is an homage to old action movies.

1327467,No it shows that they respond to community outrage and dont do their own testing.,Overwatch
1327527,Really doubtful. Your team is going to be out of range on alot of maps for healing. \n\nImagine attacking Point A on numbani. Dive members go straight through mid and can attack the top right/left. What will you do Flank solo and hope no one kills u off along the way? \n\nTrying to dive in up top on the 2nd stretch of Dorado is the same. \n\nHollywood is the same result....\n\nIt might be possible on less vertical maps but ur DPS are going to be lacking heals since Moira can't keep up(stay close) and her range is short. Even the healing orb requires perfect timing. I really don't think she's good for dive. Just because she can cause a little chaos in the backlines with tracer/genji because they're perfect for dive doesn't mean she fits in. ,Overwatch

1342007,If it's for throwing then I am pretty sure that Blizzard has to manually review it first. There have been people that have been reported 200+ times and still have not been banned but the devs did say that they are changing the system. I wouldn't worry about it if I were you.,Overwatch
1342571,As you should. Res will be balanced when it's infrequent and rewarding to pull off.,Overwatch
1342739,I'm mixed on this one. I like the idea of canceling res but it feels unintuitive.\n\nYour primary activity (beams) don't break when you turn your head. They don't even break immediately if you put a wall between your target and yourself.\n\nThe res instabreaking when you turn your head is pretty much against mercy's basic design.\n\nAnd while I do enjoy currently zipping in to res and just moving in whatever direction/facing I feel like while res continues to go off I can recognize it's potentially a bit silly mechanically.\n\nThe instant break doesn't seem like the way to do it.,Overwatch

1345550,While I do agree that Ana\u2019s ult is pretty useless in death match I don\u2019t think the \u201csharing kills\u201d would be effective. I suggest that you Nano boost yourself instead of another player because if that player is in the top 4 the you\u2019re only giving them more kills.,Overwatch

1855292,My only issue with Moira is that if an orb ends up your general direction it's unavoidable to take at least some damage no matter how good your positioning is. There's no counterplay (except for Dva and Genji) but only ways to minimize the damage. Not to mention all the unintentional kills spammed orbs get just by bouncing close to someone at low health.,Overwatch

1946558,Right? \n\nApparently 18 people really hate science,Overwatch
1948042,because it's freaking creepy dude,Overwatch
1948098,I am not a support main but I always fill in comp and tend to be a healer. Most of the support players can\u2019t really do much damage so we need to be with someone always. I play a lot of Mercy and Ana when. I do play. It\u2019s obvious that we will always try our best to keep you alive and we can\u2019t expect you to always protect us but just be mindful of us. How many times have I flown in as Mercy to heal and the player will run away. When Mercy flies using guardian angel she can\u2019t change the direction she flies in so if you turn the corner we can\u2019t follow you and you leave us behind. If you have a Mercy be kind and wait for her when she respawns and give her a lift. With Ana you would not believe how many times I\u2019ve slept someone and tried to get someone to come help me finish them off but no one ever does.\n\nHonestly when it comes to Lucios and Zennys I think that when their teammates die they are a little at fault because most Zennys I\u2019ve seen are always aggressive and forget that their primary role is support and I\u2019m sure you agree with me Lucios are almost never with their squad and are always riding around the walls and just harassing the opponents team. Maybe it\u2019s just me but those two tend to go on solo missions. But yeah just don\u2019t be too harsh on support players because when it comes to healing between a DPS and a tank we always heal the tank first because they protect us and never run into the fight alone and expect us to follow because once you die we are so dead. ,Overwatch

1953084,That's fair! I'm terrible at Ana and find playing Mercy to be boring so I like to play Zen/Lucio for enjoyment factor. Ill admit I get dps focused as Zen and don't do much healing so I typically default to Lucio with Moira for that reason but it also depends a lot on the map.,Overwatch

1963232,"Blizzard's response was essentially a lazy \""well enough people reported you and you got banned so you must have deserved it.\"" Which is pathetic when you have an auto ban system.\n\nYou can't call something a ban-able offense because a system that runs on community reporting and auto bans people with too many reports lead to a ban. That's mob rule and it's not okay.\n\nThere is no written rule by Blizzard that says if you're failing at an off-meta hero and you don't switch you're doing something report worthy.

2020373,I mean we won the game but that Orisa was tilting me hard. Well as you know the way to rez now is to do it in the back line or behind cover but I can\u2019t control where people die so I try to do my best to get to cover but you can\u2019t always control that. And the problem I was feeling is that unlike when I get flash-banged I don\u2019t feel bad because you know it\u2019s a stun or when a doomfist punches you there\u2019s a stun but you know Orisa\u2019s half ability doesn\u2019t have a stun so if she halts an ukting reaper it doesn\u2019t stop it so why is it that if I get moved like just out of reach as the sound goes off on my rez I don\u2019t even get the rez and my ability goes to cooldown?,Overwatch

2133037,See i would add him because thats the funniest thing ive heard today lol,Overwatch
2134029,I also think it has to do with the people playing on the different servers/game types. I would guess people either don't try as hard on the PTR as they do on the main server or other people are also testing out new characters that they aren't the best on so it is easier to track/kill them. ,Overwatch

2157496,I think your approaching this wrong. Roadhog is not meant to be standing in the front soaking up damage. He is not a main tank.\n\nAs Hog you should position yourself in a way that you can protect your teams backline (mostly supports) from flankers. You are an immovable obstacle to them and you can punish them hard for misplays.\n\nHog can also deal with dive pretty easily by just sitting right in the middle of his team.\n\nBasically leave the front line to your Reinhardt. As Hog you are the strong core of your team.,Overwatch
2157549,Solid point. Sometimes I fail to notice that I forget I have the luxury of not worrying so much about that shit.\n\nI've only ever been singled out *hard* by an internet stranger once and it was fucking terrifying. I don't know how you/they do it.,Overwatch

Heal!Orb usually comes out when I see multiple teammates are injured and try to use the geometry of the area to get the most out of the orb. \n\nAs for the life drain I typically use it to poke targets from far away when resource levels are okay and go more aggressive with it when I need the resource.

We won those games because people communicated their intentions and played well. \n\nI do think composition matters and it doesn't have to be 2/2/2.  The number of times I've seen teams become worthless when trying to attack a bastion on defense is proof enough of \""any comp can work\"" not really being true. \n",Overwatch
2288488,I would disagree. He has excellent burst damage and I really don't think they should tweak his damage.\n\nThis reminds me of winston in season 1-2. Everyone said he needed more damage. Then they buffed his shield cooldown and all of a sudden hes top of the ladder. Dive dominated the meta for two -three competitive seasons.\n\nAnd that was just a buff to his survivability. I think the same thing is true here. He just needs that survivability.\n\n\nI mean look at Dva. She has an effecitive dps 1.5x higher than doom even when he uses his skills and thats NOT including her rockets. And she has 600hp plus another 150 as tiny dva.

But Tracer can easily just recall when she takes a lot of damage since Moira doesn't have much burst damage potential to quickly kill Tracer. And Tracer outdamages her self heal.

2345405,I wonder what it'd be like if a super pro team attempted a strat where you do as little damage to the enemy as possible until you can guarantee a kill and therefore feeding the least possible ult charge while also getting more ults for your own team (at least supports...).

2542030,The first part of Junkertown is the easiest part. It sounds like you're not running heroes that are strong in open areas. Since it's an open area you're likely to see Bastion or snipers. You can stay Bastion for the rest of the map but you got to be smart during the 2nd stage since Surprise Junkrat might attack.\n\nDifferent heroes are better in certain situations like open or closed parts of map which is why it's important to consider composition and think about swapping when the map goes from open to close,Overwatch

2570259,mercy is low MECHANICAL SKILL. same with symmetra. there is no discussion on this. they were designed to be mechanically easy to play. heroes like winston although are mechanically easy are still harder than mercy in that respect. \n\ntorb actually requires high mechanical skill. his rivet gun is a pretty hard projectile based weapon to accurately land. \n\njust like how there are idiots who think mercy doesn't require skill. there are a lot mercy players who think mercy requires more skill than mechanically skilled heroes. like they think game sense/awareness is a thing ONLY support heroes have and that DPS players don't have any game sense/awareness and only mechanical skill. \n\nevery hero uses game sense/awareness. its the building block/foundation for mechanical skill. being mechanically good without game sense is the same as a person who has never played the game using aim hacks. you need that much mechanical skill to yield positive effects without a solid foundation. \n\njust because you play support does not mean you use game sense/awareness more than DPS. only bad players think that. a DPS player needs to know exactly where their teammates are at all times just like a support player. just because your gun doesn't interact with allies doesn't mean you don't need to have this knowledge in game. \n\nlets not pretend anything. shes a low MECHANICAL SKILL HERO. she was designed that way on purpose.\n\n**EDIT:** \n\ndespite what i said above. mercy has the lowest skill requirement in the game. *gasp.* that does not mean you should hate on mercy players or other heroes that require low skill like the original point of this thread. with that being said.....\n\nwe have already covered that mercy has the lowest mechanical skill requirement in the game. even symmetra has a higher mechanical skill requirement. \n\nskill should arguably be measured by two types of things right? mechanical skill and non measurable stuff like game sense etc?\n\nthen by that logic. mercy is the lowest skill required hero simply because mercy DOES NOT have any game sense/awareness portion of skill that a player playing on say a soldier would not have. il give an example:\n\neverybody should be able to accurately guess-timate if certain heroes on the enemy team has ultimates right? as a person who plays symmetra. i go one step further. i count how many times enemy reinhardts land fire strikes because i need to be able to block earthshatters with barrier. i know each hit from firestrike gives reinhardt 7-8%. this allows me to even accurately measure when he has ultimate and i'm sure somewhere in korea. some little korean player can measure it even better than i can. \n\nthere is no cap on game sense/awareness. this type of knowledge is not only transferable between heroes but is available to everybody and there is no such thing as a game sense that say only mercy will know or only soldier would know. \n\nthere is no such thing as selective game sense. its applicable to every hero. \n\ni have less than 10 minutes played on mercy but i know EVERYTHING about her. its all there online. i did my research. i need to know how to kill mercy so the more i know about how mercy is played the more i can kill her. and if i decide that one day i'm going to be a mercy player. then i will be able to transfer game sense i learned from another hero to mercy. which increases my game sense/awareness for that new hero. \n\nTLDR: just because a hero like mercy has her kit revolving around 95% game sense and 5% mechanical skill. that does not mean mercy uses or has more game sense than a soldier. all heroes in the game has the same amount of game sense: infinite. what dictates how much game sense a hero has is the player that controls the hero.\n\nsince game sense is equal across all heroes. heroes that require more mechanical skill would be the most skill demanding hero. sadly a hero like mercy is at the bottom since she is the easiest hero to play on a mechanical level. ,Overwatch

2635449,most important thing about tracer is the aim. \n\ntracer is all about tracking. unlike mccree/widow where their damage is from singular bullets. tracer's DPS comes from 40 bullets. meaning you need to have your crosshairs on the enemy at all times. if your aim is off for even a fraction of a second. your DPS is going to drop considerably because she fires all 40 bullets in 1 second. \n\nshes less about flicking shots and more about consistently keeping crosshairs on enemies. \n\ndepending on your preference. you need to test sensitivity and see what you are comfortable with. the general rule is to lower sensitivity. this way you use your whole arm to aim. get a big mouse pad or large area for that. if you aim with your wrists. the slightest movement can move your crosshairs too far. \n\ntracer is about aiming at the neck. tracer has pretty large spread on her gun once she starts firing. if you aim at the head or anywhere above that. the spread will be too large for such a small hitbox on the head. majority of the target will not be in your spread unless you are REALLY close. by aiming near the neck. you can fill up more of your gun spread. hitting the body is better than missing all together but hitting headshot is still the best. you are trying to maximize your DPS. that can mean not trying to land 100% headshot. baby dva/enemy tracers may have too small of a target to headshot unless you are within 1 meter of them. you may want to body shot them instead and by maximizing DPS. \n\nand since tracer is consistently moving/blinking around targets. you need to be able to do all of this while being mobile. a stationary tracer is a dead tracer. ,Overwatch

2667848,As a Rein main: NO!!! What you do after a shatter should be totally reliant upon the positioning of yourself and everyone else on the field. While it can be devastating to firestrike-charge a single enemy in many cases it\u2019s better to swing your hammer after the strike and deal a bunch of area damage if you\u2019ve got multiple people down. While charging a single larger enemy works I wouldn\u2019t suggest it unless there\u2019s a wall right behind them to keep you from carrying yourself away from the fight. ,Overwatch
