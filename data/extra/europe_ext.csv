27729,I'm a native English (US) and Spanish (Spain) speaker. I've never had any issue understanding any Spanish speaker so far. \n\nUS English and UK English have different phonologies (they don't even have the same amount of vowels) so even if the words are the same it can be difficult to understand if you're not used to it. I think you're thinking of a very specific accent when you think of a British accent. It also helps greatly that most people have prior exposure to that specific accent.\n\nIberian Spanish and American Spanish on the other hand always have an extremely similar phonology even if some vocabulary is different (I don't even think the vocabulary differences are bigger than in US vs UK tbh).\n\nWhere are you from by the way? I ask this because American Spanish encapsulates a ton of accents which vary in their similarity to Castilian Spanish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,europe

The problem is more that the distribution is complicated. The biggest problem is the not so democratic organisation of GEMA. Also there are GEMA alternatives but they don't have near as much bargaining power as GEMA because they are quite small: https://www.c3s.cc . But also as mentioned before within GEMA artist don't have to much choice about rights management. You also don't have to participate at all - which quite some musician choose especially if they main gigs are at small venues.\n\nFor me GEMA is one of the complicated cases where people are just to fast to judge. In reality it's complicated. Also in Germany changes take quite some time (germans are super conservative) - which is not bad. But from my experience musician who actually have to live just from their music are far les critical about GEMA and most criticism is from people who has to pay GEMA - consumers and venues.\n,europe

However to the point you made about westerners being ignorant and lacking self-criticism I say this: the general sentiment in the west is that many things that our nations have done in the past have been morally and causally wrong. I don't see this same phenomenon in Russia.\n\nI don't ask you to apologise for anything but historical ignorance and inaccuracy will once again lead from another oligarch/despot to another in Russia.
