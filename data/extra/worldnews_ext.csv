When the UNSC wants to enforce a UNGA resolution or treaty it creates a resolution to do that. This happens all the time. I'll give you a quick example: the Rwandan genocide: the Geneva convention is an international treaty (or collection of treaties) and the genocide convention is a resolution that was passed by the UNGA. When the UNSC wanted to enforce these treaties/UNGA resolutions in regard to Rwanda it created a [resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_955) in order to do that. And when it wanted to enforce the ruling of the tribunal it created another [resolution](http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2256\\(2015\\)) to that. ,worldnews

731607,"Trumo retweeted random videos from an Organization that has been said to be the UK equivliant to the modern KKK. \nCan you see how thats fucked up? We know the anti gay sentiments of Muslims..(as well as many Christians).  It is wildly fucked up that that they have been killed/harassed etc etc across the planet especially in many Muslim countries. These are facts. The question is WHY is Trump tweeting about it? You think he would ever tweet abouy people getting Gay Bashed on American streets? Thats a thing that still happens.\nThe video with the kid on crutches has been debunked as a \""schoolyard\"" fight. No Muslims involved. How can Trump have a problem with fake news if he is tweeting that shit himself.\n\n5 attacks a day? Where are you getting that info? From what ive read it averages out to around 1 a day. Thats still crazy fucked up. You know what else is fucked up? Many if not most of those attacks have nothing to do with Muslims. You should look it up. Its eaiser to buy acid then a gun in the UK and you get caught with a knife youre in a lot of trouble. Acid attacks have gone way up for sure. But the UK has a long long history of acid attacks. Way  before the so called Muslim invasion.\n\nDo \""Muslim Rape gangs\"" Rape more than the rapists spesfically? Or is rape just a problem that our socitey has? I dont know if stats are kept on rapists by religon. Some info on that would be appreciated. \n\n Havent heard anything about a terroist attack every week. Got a source on that?  Id be happy to look at that as well.\n\n\nFear of Van based terroist attacks? They are terrible and scary. For sure. Do you also fear getting in a regular car accident or getting murdered the old fashioned way? Those are also scary and more common.\n\nIll give you Mohammed is now the second most common name in the UK. Not sure how that makes it an Islamic state. It just means. There are lots of Muslims there.\n\nHow does the mayor support terroism? Educate me please.\n\nCouldnt find any info about Arabic highway signs. Like zero. That would be weird. Did you mean some of the signs also have arabic? Couldnt find that either. But..if that does exist. Whats wrong with that? Ever been to Chinatown in Toronto or New York or Vancouver? Those signs dont look very English to me. Does that mean we are living in a Chiniese state? \n\nMaybe we could both do with a little research..some of that stuff you posted seems a little..suspect..but I am happy to read more on the subject if you happen to have some links.\n\nBy the way What is an Islamic state? Cause based on the above youve basically said . \""There are Muslins in the UK.\n\nLooking forward to your response\nCheers\n\nEdit- So many typos but im lazy and leaving them in",worldnews

Go ahead and add a pound as prices are cheaper here in the Midwestern USA. Still not too bad a price. Another thing you seem to forget is those of low income don't often buy a lot of food at a time due to money constraints. Some fear the thought of spending 50 pounds at the grocery and would more readily welcome spending 10 pounds at McDonalds even though you and I know it will be more expensive in the long run.

No one of any party wants to accept anything that challenges their beliefs so they bury it or deflect. Don't try and say this is just a T_D thing. This is an everybody thing.

1831871,Got a source?\n\nMy experience working in water treatment is that treatment plants control the pH of the water exiting the plant. A large part of the reason for this is that chlorine gas reacts with water to form hypochlorous acid. Treatment plants then add a base such as CaOH to raise pH until it's at a level that won't corrode pipes or cause other damage. Smaller water systems typically add chlorine as NaOCl(bleach) or Ca(OCL)2 which raises the pH of the water; they then need to add acid to the system.\n\nIt seems more likely that the water is acidic due to the large volumes of pH altering chemicals added during treatment than it is due to some unnamed (high volume) acidic pollutant. Treatment requires large volumes of pH balancing chemical and any pollutant would have to be in correspondingly high volumes.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI went and looked into it a little. The water's pH in the distribution system was due to treatment. The corrosion was likely due to road salt combined with the treated water's pH as well as iron and lead pipes in the distribution system.\n\nhttp://www.dhss.delaware.gov/dph/hsp/files/odwtts16.pdf,worldnews

If she claimed to be a minority and is not (is there proof that she has NO ancestry or is the meme running the conversation?) and benefited from that then of course she deserves criticism. I think all politicians deserve criticism. \n\nWhat bothers me is the whataboutism here. You eviscerated my example by playing down the Andrew Jackson thing and saying that Pocahontas is not a slur while drawing the focus from Trump's ugly behavior to Warren. Literally a Russian whataboutism tactic that has taken such a firm hold in the conservative community in the age of Trump thanks to overconsumption of propaganda media and confirmation bias. The Andrew Jackson thing was exceptionally wrong no matter how you choose to turn it around in your mind until you think it isn't. Pocahontas is an absolute slur. It is an unwelcome word that literally makes a categorization about race. That you defend both of those things is proof that I am wasting my time trying to have an honest discussion with yet another Trump supporter who feigns reasonable behavior until the facts come out.,worldnews

Truly his raid in the heart of terrorist occupied land would prove that he had the balls to take a risk Obama wouldn't.

Trump's would be so much more exciting and prove how Presidential he was so short into the term where he promised to end Isis in 100 days. Instead it resulted in death and carnage.
