380375,No problem man. It was probably best that you called 911 just in case. Sorry that you were received so rudely. In my experience any emergency with drugs involved leads to paramedics shaming one or more parties at the scene. People try to withhold judgments but often fail. Don\u2019t let it get you down and don\u2019t fall for the \u201cmightier than though cus I don\u2019t do drugs\u201d bullshit that anyone you encounter pulls on you. We can all make our own decisions and smoking weed is not a bad one compared to all the other horrible things people do.,trees

In other words it can lower your pain threshold where as you can get knocked out while on vicodin and still be nodding off. \n\nNeedless to say you could still nod off on cannabis and it would be funner because the withdrawals aren't nearly as bad as opioids.

I still smoke but just nearly as much. And the key is to make something a priority in your life. Take something and make yourself want it so bad that you would put aside smoking weed for it. Seems like a dumb statement but I understand how much easier that is said than done. I've done it and now I have a 4.0 and I'm working towards getting into med school. You will thank yourself. Start tomorrow pick an easy goal. Decide you want to start working out for example and just wait until after your workout to smoke.

No big deal. If you do then just pick up a hobby or do whatever it is you already like to do sober. Of course the effects are going to dull after smoking for a while.

1350132,Thanks frient!  Very good advice.  I\u2019ve had anxiety for about 20 years now so I have definitely used CBT.  It actually is a huge reason I could get to a point in my life where I wasn\u2019t a raging mess (I also suffer from ocd and depression.  Although my ocd is very mild).  I do only use weed sparingly but it just helps relax my mind.  I was already at a point where I could control my anxiety before I started smoking.  But smoking helps the attacks happen less which is nice.  I\u2019m a huge advocate of CBT though!  I\u2019m so glad you have found it helpful as well.  Re-training your brain can take a lot of time but it 100% changed my life!\n\nHave you ever read the book mind over mood?  That is the book that changed my life.  It helped me learn really valuable techniques that I still use all the time (10 years after reading it).\n\nCheers!,trees

1531079,The max voltage you want to run on carts is 4.20 coincidentaly. My friends alien mod only goes down to 6 watts which usually gets it to about 5 volts which is too high. If your mod can go low enough to get it under 4.20 volts then go for it! It\u2019s recommended to run them at about 3.5-3.7 volts; Those carts tend to be about 2.2 ohms so as long as your mod goes low enough to be around 3.5 volts then it won\u2019t ruin the cart\n\nEdit: just tried out a few different carts. Generally they\u2019re around 2.2 ohms and I run mine at 3.5 volts which means the wattage on my mod needs to be 5.5 watts. If you\u2019re alien mod also only goes down 6 watts it should be fine. I ran the numbers through a ohm\u2019s law calculator and 6 watts on a 2.2 ohm cart puts it at 3.63 volts which is safe and in the ideal range! ,trees

Another time the lady asked where I wanted hair to be taken from. Both times I passed. I used a hair detox that was way overpriced but it worked. I stopped smoking bought a 7 day total body cleanse. After 8 days I shaved all the hair off my body. Waited for some hair to grow in and started using a neutrogina charcoal shampoo and apple cider vinegar. Repeated pretty much all the way til the week before my test then I used the detox shampoo. It burned like hell but it worked. Made my skin peel too. Probably not good for the body.

2352522,So shake is just the little peices of leaves and thc crystals that fall the bottom on a large batch of weed. It can be pretty good depending on where the shake comes from (shake from bad weed would be shitty shake but shake from rly good weed is usually is pretty damn good just does not look as nice as a bud). As from stems i would stay away from smoking as they tend to give me headaches and dont get me high at all. You could collect the stems and grind them snd make edibles with them but you would need alot( like a half ounce at least). Hope that helps. Happy toking!!!,trees
