26113,Didnt even know those existed to be honest,soccer
26291,I think we control the game better with our current midfield and Isco sitting in front of them. I really like that formation and believe we shouldn't put blame on the narrow midfield because everyone is moving constantly. The reason we are playing like shit is because our defense has been really poor this season and we depend on Ronaldo to score all the goals because Benzema is just moving around up front without ever really doing much and can't finish for shit,soccer
26423,Look at teams that have gone down mate. They\u2019re stripped of all their best players because they can\u2019t afford the wage bill &amp; teams know they have to sell and get stranded in the Championship. Hardly any teams have managed to bounce back into the PL after being relegated. You watch your club stay midtable because you love them. Not everyone just supports a successful team thousands of miles from their home. I (and millions others) care more about the welfare of our clubs than we do about playing the best football.,soccer

1529516,I'm not volunteering but what would be helpful is if you or someone volunteered to choose a forward and then for each game provide a time stamp of each shot they take. A list of those will make it much easier for someone who is going to edit the video to pull together the required clips rather than having to BOTH watch the game and make the video. You can speed up timestamp recording by using something like statszone to see when shots were taken during matches and by whom and making a list for each player and each game. \n\nProviding links to full match videos would also be helpful. ,soccer

1611336,huh? Portugal and Spain will roll Group B. ,soccer
1611361,Will they draw again for the round of 16? Or is it already determined?,soccer
1611414,How dare you turn your back on your true Peruvian self.,soccer
1611438,Russia and Uruguay to go through. Home advantage and i do think Russia are decent and people are just blowing them off like they don't stand a chance and i would like to see the home team go further. ,soccer
1611450,I feel like people are underrating Iran and Morocco here. Iran is one of the strongest Asian teams for years and Morocco has had a very competent qualifying. Whoever loses the first game between Portugal and Spain will be under a lot of pressure.,soccer
1611477,If Guerrero could stay banned that would be brilliant.,soccer
1611482,Don't even start with this shit. You guys need to put a rough match against the French. \n\nTime to stop being an underdog and step up.,soccer
1611578,I think that's not the issue here. You didn't qualify so you don't get trash talking rights. Just shut up and watch the grown ups play football.,soccer
1611589,Are we in the group of death? yeah I think so,soccer
1611610,Still can't believe there'll be no spaghetti,soccer

1612107,i guess but it happens way too much in the CL and WC for it to be possible. ,soccer
1612226,Spain will yes but I'm not too sure about Portugal. Don't underestimate Morocco dude. Iran is a tough side as well,soccer
1612233,Argentina vs Nigeria could be good if history is anything to go by,soccer
1612429,Idk we usually behave ourselves in the WC ,soccer
1612450,I'm so tired of playing Argentina. Guess we'll just have to beat them again like we did last month:P. Jk should be exciting once again ,soccer

1613720,I'm kinda happy the first game is against spain. If it was the last the players would only think about that.\n\nThis way its soon done and even if we don't win they can focus on the other two,soccer
1613770,UP THE RAMBLE. dg,soccer
1613776,I mean Group F is pretty fucking tough. Sweden isn't getting enough respect. The rest of the groups are pretty even. Group D is tough but we all have our weaknesses in that group so it can go any which way.

1614218,Isn't Brazil the most populated country?,soccer
1614272,When looking at how difficult a group is I'm looking at it from every teams perspective. Morocco and Iran have a tough one and also Spain and Portugal (teams who would expect themselves to finish 1st) will be fighting each other to finish 1st. Not good for anyone in the group really,soccer

1616941,They probably questioned him because he was coming into the league in his mid 30's...but sure run with that one instead,soccer
1616979,Seems a bit exaggerated to name Belgium as a perennial underachiever. They went to the quarterfinals last WC and before that they never really had that good of a squad. ,soccer

1617025,On to inevitably go out to Germany and Brazil if we make it to the quarter finals though. ,soccer
1617055,Yet.,soccer
1617069,I'm happy. \n\nI really think this group works to our strengths. Nigeria is tough draw and I do respect them but if we can't collect points here we have no right to be at WC looking for anything. You can't have many easier opening matches. Iceland have a tough feat vs Argentina. If we were opening up vs Argentina I would be a little more scared. This group is difficult but we play Iceland last and with no disrespect to them I really like how they play but it works in our favor because we have more attack then they do. We've beaten them twice and lost once to a pretty woeful defensive mistake in the last second. I rather play Iceland than anyone parking the bus. Argentina we can win/tie/lose it's up in the air but I'm glad we avoided some other big teams. It's a tough group but I'm 100% confident we will go through.,soccer

1622706,They're definitely going undefeated in the group stage. Don't @ me,soccer
1622775,I don't think either team has very good right wingers?,soccer
1622790,Cunts,soccer
1622820,Yep agreed. They get so much love but they've achieved about as much as we have recently. I think we can beat them,soccer
1622851,Its Russia dude.\nEvery groupe is hard for us.,soccer
1622854,Christ you are deluded and bitter haha,soccer

1623044,After the WC Flores will fly away with his ears,soccer
1623063,Uruguay vs Egypt is your first game and I think that decides 1st,soccer
1623288,England should qualify fairly comfortably and a good chance to finish top. It\u2019s England at a World cup though so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised either if their games ended as three 0-0 draws consisting almost entirely of sideways and backwards passes.,soccer
1623442,[deleted],soccer
1623496,E is definitely not easy. Switzerland is a great team. Serbia was probably the strongest in pot 4 and Costa Rica can always surprise.,soccer

1624197,I guess we have more room for disappointment than you do,soccer
1624220,England has won more world cups than you. All you ever accomplished on the world stage is reaching the final and choking like a bitch. Now you didn't even qualify for two major consecutive tournaments. All of this screams mediocrity. The current English team would actually embarrass you (can't believe I'm making a point for England right now but that's just how it is).,soccer

2051193,Panama were very weird in that game. They tried to come out and attack. They\u2019re normally a team that sits deep and tries to play on the counter but their midfielders were pushing way up the pitch. No way they do that in the World Cup.,soccer
2051437,You're right. The LVG years are a gap in my memory. Probably because I ended up falling asleep during so many matches.,soccer
2051473,I'm not sure that being down to 10 men is a sufficient explanation for the defense being this bad.,soccer
2051578,In many ways you can\u2019t compare but in one way France has nearly always been the same. And that\u2019s inconsistency. I\u2019m not talking results. I\u2019m talking performances. We historically have regularly struggled against teams several tiers below us while at the same time and with the same exact team put up world class performances. It\u2019s a staple of our teams DNA. Just like the Italian teams have long been known for iron strong defenses and the Germans for machine-like efficiency France is inconsistent genius. One second they are best in the world and the very next they look like a Sunday pick up team. ,soccer

2218413,I can't remember exactly where those numbers come from.  I wrote all this code in the run up to the 2014 World Cup.  But basically it's based on historical results.  \n\nThe basic Elo equation is pretty simple (details [here](http://www.eloratings.net/system.html)).  But here we need to know how many goals each team scored to calculate goal difference and settle tiebreakers.  Those numbers you mention are just an empirical fit to the probability of scoring X goals based on a certain Elo ratings difference.  I wish I could find where they are from - I think i found that model at http://clubelo.com/,soccer
