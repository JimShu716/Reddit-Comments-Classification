24632,Exactly.  They could have easily adjusted Varus's lore in small ways to get the same result if not a better one.  Instead we've got an LGBTQ Darkin replacing what Varus used to be.  \n\n_Soooooooooo_ much potential compared to a vengeance-driven warden who tries to use a Darkin weapon for justice.  /s\n\nLiterally could have just done this lore for a _NEW_ champion.  Varus's model/abilities/voiceover don't make sense now.  They forced this _way too hard_ for no justifiable reason beyond laziness in developing a new character vs just butchering and completely rewriting an existing one.\n\nThat's like if Zoe wasn't a thing and instead Annie got her lore rewritten to be some ancient fire spirit thing with Tibbers as her personal guardian.

But they can always go to a shitty League ripoff if they want softcore porn in their games.,leagueoflegends
47574,I know what they've done but I have no sense of character from them. Part of this problem is that the story is trying to fit three different characters into one and doing poorly at it because of it.,leagueoflegends
47662,I'm with you.\n\nI especially think online culture always has this narrative to make the gay guy the attractive guy.   As if there can't be any good looking men who's straight.\n\nIf they are looking for everyone to be able to relate with a champion.   There is already Taric.   A lot of reddit says Ezreal is gay too.   So who exactly can I relate with?   ,leagueoflegends

59049,Not sure what this has to do with the convo but I think it's because he is way to safe compared to most mid laners,leagueoflegends
59150,This guy gets it. The change is too forced and doesn't feel natural to the character. It's not like made a brand new character and decided he or she was gay. This [snippet](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7gqbb0/varus_being_changed_to_gay_feels_wrong_for_his/dql0h04/) from a higher comment frames it in a way that this dude does it just to do it. It's not a meaningful decision in anyway.,leagueoflegends

94369,They said something along the lines that a manaless champion isn't restricted enough in the role since ADs get easy access to early(ish) life steal making their early games really hard to balance. Also the reason AD Kennen gets nerfed every time he surfaces as a viable option.

233859,He\u2019s not the only guy in the game written as a family man and he is not the only instance of a character confirmed in a heterosexual relationship we have Xayah and Rakan and we also have Lucian and Senna off the top of my head alone.\n\nBut let\u2019s address what doesn\u2019t make sense exactly and what you don\u2019t like precisely cause that makes no sense to me. His motivation is unchanged between the lore he gives into darkness for the sake of his loved ones. Valmar is the same as old Varus and Kai fills the role of his family and his conscience. The new lore adds more depth to the bow and the family angle. So then the question becomes \u201cwhy not incorporate the wife and kid into the story\u201d?\n\nOne could argue if they wanted to give the lover presence then it becomes awkward for Varus to have a male and female in his body in order for his current model to work he needs to be composed of two men. Changing him gay creates less work for them overall and appeals to an audience they haven\u2019t appealed to before.\n\n\u201cWhy not make a new champion with this lore\u201d cause it appears Riot is trying to create an overarching lore and they need to connect everyone Varus\u2019 old lore is too self contained and changing the bow into a Darkin doesn\u2019t explain anything about how he would fit into everyone else\u2019s lore and it would also not go in-depth in the bow who would just be a \u201ccorruption\u201d in the old lore.\n\nBut here\u2019s my big problem with this whole discussion on Varus being gay ruining his lore. The entire basis for this argument are platitudes that make no sense \u201ccheapens the lore\u201d and demonizing something for the sake of making it seem bad \u201cpc stuff is a disease\u201d consider for a moment that writing him gay is simply what they wanted to do and that it created the least amount of work for them and not that there\u2019s some shadow man trying to fuck all of you in the ass using gay propaganda.,leagueoflegends

278574,Well I think you are going too far the other way tbh. There's some truth to these statements even though they are overblown.\n\nI honestly think he just needs a team where he isn't the captain type and play more responsive/reactive based on a strong voice shot calling rather than having to be proactive and lead others. Just feel like it is more of his wheelhouse and would allow him to shine even more as I still think he is on a superstar level or at least has the potential to be. He's been the captain pretty much since CLG EU. Kinda like Bjergsen with TSM who at times also has looked a bit constrained based on having to be the main voice of the team.,leagueoflegends

Same reason why people hate pantheon and jayce tho jayce ATLEAST CAN be beaten because jayce needs to be played really really good to be successful. ,leagueoflegends
332719,Ryu and Meteos are just average players right now and this is 2017 one star player doesnt mean you can win game anymore. Cody and Aphro are probably the worst bot lane in NA LCS and combine that with a passive jungler who loves to farm and a mid laner who was below average on most champs last season makes for a unpromising team. The fuck is Ssumday gonna do with this team rofl. We saw Ssumday on Diginitas and this 100T will be a worse version of that.,leagueoflegends

452651,Really my only issue with it is that it changes who varus is to me.\n\nI used to read the lore constantly and i knew Varus for his family and his story of vengeance after their brutal murder. That was a story i loved.\n\nThis new varus lore to me Is NOT Varus. I would have prefered a new character to be brought in rather than retconing an established story that i loved. Iv got no problem with gay characters in league i just want them to be their own rather than wiping away the ones i loved.\n\nVarus is dead long live Vaarus.,leagueoflegends
454099,40min game and less than 300 cs means you probably cs'd well for the majority of the game but its still low ish when the overall goal is 10/min. the trinket usage and control wards play a big role in what grade you get also. ,leagueoflegends

But seriously i enjoyed Varus' old familyman lore. If they wanted to add in a new Darkin they could have made a simple change to the pre existing lore or hell i would have been perfectly fine if they had of taken these two new guys and put them into a new Darkin character.

The problem comes when a champion in a new role causes game health issues. \n\nBest example was supports in mid a long time ago.

It's been established the aftermath of destruction via world runes can open tears in reality letting the void seep through. This is why he wants to assemble individuals with exceptional fighting skill and is why he uses a lampost as a weapon. He wants to test warriors to see if they can challenge and therefore prove worthy of assisting him in his endeavor.,leagueoflegends

656668,The suite life of zac and cody,leagueoflegends
656737,I realise that but you haven't given me a reason for why people should be caring this much about lore being changed or why anyone is shocked by it. They got rid of summoners existing in the lore which is probably the only important part so why would anything else be off limits? ,leagueoflegends
656761,I like the name.,leagueoflegends
656932,Seeing Vayne...regardless of which team she is on.,leagueoflegends
656981,Ugh. I hate this and I hate gays. Yes I am homophobic and no you can\u2019t change me.,leagueoflegends
657295,i think he just needs his range buffs back. buff his culling and Q range and start there. if that isn't enough give him scaling range by levels. maybe at level 6 and 11 he gains 25 range. so at level 11 he has 550 range. would keep him from being oppressive early but he still scales into a viable adc late.  and 550 range is nothing crazy later in the game. ,leagueoflegends
657398,I hope they do something nice with her lore.,leagueoflegends

659811,There will atleast be 1 dash and 1 movement speed boost on this champion as well.  \nRiot brings so much diversity in champion kits by giving mobility to all :),leagueoflegends

661741,too bad they disbanded their sc2 team for this :( they actually had good players,leagueoflegends
662163,How is any of it fan service? It's just changing it from an entity becoming one with Varus to it now being a weapon that is Varus ,leagueoflegends

927878,Definetly not Blitzcrank is definetly not a darkin.,leagueoflegends
927958,All I play is ranked and I still see this shit.  ,leagueoflegends
928124,Bruh\n\nI was using the example of Darksiders as an analogy to the five.,leagueoflegends
928129,And his nuts,leagueoflegends
928191,[deleted],leagueoflegends
928626,u r a classic case of an ignorant fool,leagueoflegends
928635,That was never official canon.,leagueoflegends
928664,no,leagueoflegends
928761,[deleted],leagueoflegends
928844,What about for those players who use different keys to use skill. For example i use A-S-D-F and C-V for summoner spells.,leagueoflegends
928959,So who is Varus now?   \nIs he just the bow? Is he the guy people turn into?,leagueoflegends
929087,"New anime coming from this called \""Trigay\"".",leagueoflegends
929136,lol?,leagueoflegends

929727,"Your comment is everything but respecting gay people. And I am gay and I am getting offended that you connect just the existance of a non-straight character/s that you \""have\"" to appeal to us.",leagueoflegends
929990,No way man. There's SO MUCH HERE,leagueoflegends
930163,They used Haru.,leagueoflegends
930231,It's not trashy at all. The only trashy thing here is you.,leagueoflegends
930252,He played bad in 2016 and his time in Afreeca was sub-par so I get why they wouldn't want to pay him a very high Salary. It's conflicting because being on SKT is hard in many aspects and maybe knowing that MaRin wasn't willing to sign again unless he was compensated well considering that.,leagueoflegends
930318,i am afraid yes,leagueoflegends
930364,But what part of the story got lost in simplifying it except for \u201edeal with the devil to achieve revenge\u201c? No part of his past actions even mattered at that point.\n,leagueoflegends
930420,I like how people are refering to his explanation rather than just saying what it means. It is really a meaningfull name anyone can relate to....,leagueoflegends
930657,No he just went to Overwatch and mistaken Hanzo as his brother,leagueoflegends
930673,you need another w in the post to the video lmao,leagueoflegends
930731,I said it earlier today in another thread.  We went from having a bad-ass Punisher champion to having a really shitty version of Enchantress from Suicide Squad.,leagueoflegends
930897,Its actually two very small Darkins controlling a robot. ,leagueoflegends
930952,I'm gonna burn you down with Riot then,leagueoflegends
931082,Not again...,leagueoflegends
931122,Got diamond V with it! Got it? Because we all challengers here on reddit! ,leagueoflegends
931232,A Captain Jack qss is often referred to plays where a player uses qss/cleanse at the same moment the cc hits. Making it look like the cc never hit in the first place since you can continue moving.,leagueoflegends
931257,Her tits,leagueoflegends
931417,And there goes the excitement...,leagueoflegends
931632,riot should allow us to refund varus.\n,leagueoflegends
931634,NO,leagueoflegends
931641,Not again...\n\nNOT AGAIN!,leagueoflegends
931714,Yeah but they aren't stand out talents like danish player are,leagueoflegends
931723,That is the explanation in form of an example. \n\nThey put work in creating champs and only a few champs are played really often while others are incredible bad and no one plays them. How can you not get it? Every single champ in the game should be on an level where you still can play them without having issues just because no one cares about them,leagueoflegends
931882,&gt;Like what the the fuck is the RIGHT way to have a gay character for these people then?\n\nI'd say there is no right way for these people lmao,leagueoflegends
931887,Yeah.\n\nAnd I think Ornn is way stronger in toplane than Ezreal is in botlane.,leagueoflegends
931908,[removed],leagueoflegends
931981,Maybe they are moving from KR imports to *Ex-SKT-imports only*,leagueoflegends
932012,Are they sharp?,leagueoflegends
932039,"This is exactly the problem. Companies can't make gay characters without being accused for \""filling the diversity quota.\"" That is ridiculous and that is the exact reason why we need it more.",leagueoflegends
932147,Bard dance,leagueoflegends
932262,how lol,leagueoflegends
932469,Good post. ,leagueoflegends
932491,Was about to write this exact comment haha. Honestly the absolute worst ,leagueoflegends
932828,WE HAVE TO FACE THE POSSIBLE TRUTH BARE WITH ME,leagueoflegends
933240,[deleted],leagueoflegends
933270,Thanks a lot!,leagueoflegends
933458,Can you explain it please?,leagueoflegends
933650,Kind of crazy how they just shit on and write off clutch gamings analytics so hard.  It feels like they are being overly defensive of what riot presents as relevant metrics to League.,leagueoflegends
933695,MUGA\n\nMake Untara Great Again,leagueoflegends
933756,Varus is the Darkkin; Varus is not gay.\n\nVarus assimilated two gays to create his body.,leagueoflegends
933811,I'm missing the reference here...,leagueoflegends
934017,Would give succ,leagueoflegends
934064,[removed],leagueoflegends
934175,It is pretty dumb considering a good zoe can flank and force flashes with a good bubble or potentially get a double bubble on someone.\n\n\nImho the CD refund on it has to go and probably turn the truedmg into magic as well\n\nI don't even wanna see her in Urf EVER.,leagueoflegends
934196,Do it then,leagueoflegends
934488,I severely doubt; from my experiences both with and against Ornn; that he will be permabanned.\n\nAlso; you forgot Kalista.,leagueoflegends
934547,no plz,leagueoflegends
934616,The morgana theory is random but the irelia one might not be completly wrong since irelia's blades stap her when she dies similar to how varus bow does and with irelia rework soon Riot can completly rewrite her lore to make her a darkin if they wanted to ,leagueoflegends
934782,I've been looking for a new wallpaper to use and this is perfect~ Thank you for creating and sharing!!!,leagueoflegends
934874,Kayle looks like a drunk country rocker guy who always walks around with a guitar and shouts YEAHHH!!,leagueoflegends
935093,imagine a darkkin reworked kindred story \n\n(dont want it but it would suit her/them),leagueoflegends
935711,Well Shurima could have been a wasteland twice.\n\nWhere's your second part stated?,leagueoflegends
935774,Oh didn't know it was today! That's actually oddly funny for some reason. Thank you!,leagueoflegends
935805,Yeah Varus seemed to have done them a favor. But their free-will is the price,leagueoflegends
935988,"I tried that and it doesn't show anything. All it shows/says is \""We can't find any recorded highlights\"".",leagueoflegends
936201,TIL people give a shit about League lore.,leagueoflegends
936250,RIP SKT Marin my dreams :(,leagueoflegends
936376,thanks &lt;3,leagueoflegends

937773,So does every player.  They''ll leave when they get a good offer. ,leagueoflegends
937963,Also Aphro is credited as being a leader and a teacher while Olleh (as fuckin good as he is) didn't really have that same rep ,leagueoflegends
937997,She always had the red streak in her hair mate,leagueoflegends
938018,laning against kalista janna is cancer,leagueoflegends
938067,WHATUSAY? ,leagueoflegends
938230,Pawn doing his best Huhi Azir cosplay that game. ,leagueoflegends

938320,alright who got excited ,leagueoflegends
938456,Bottom lane carried so hard.,leagueoflegends
938470,Quite impressed by Ruler considering he used to feed his ass off and fall 30+ cs behind every single time he'd play against Deft in LCK Spring/Summer.,leagueoflegends
938600,[removed],leagueoflegends
938601,khmmmm aphroo was duoing with qt khmmmm ,leagueoflegends
938777,To quote some guy on reddit:   \n\n&gt;I was hoping the international audience wouldn't have to witness the horror that is Ambition-less Samsung. I'm sorry you guys had to go through this.,leagueoflegends
938785,So you wanted to know why Kalista was a 100% red side ban at worlds? See this game.,leagueoflegends
938810,[removed],leagueoflegends
938910,Ban kalista,leagueoflegends
938914,Is it actually canon that the 2 humans are gay?,leagueoflegends
938994,Exactly... Old Bankplank is back and stronger than ever.,leagueoflegends
939038,sorry can you explain? I havent played in like a year and it just seems like its taking forever to even get 1350 points..,leagueoflegends
939048,[deleted],leagueoflegends
939050,Daily reminder that Kalista was perm banned last month. Teams got cocky and forgot about her. Oh and Ardent is still cancer. ,leagueoflegends
939118,i honestly don't know why they renewed Haru's contract when they are so much worse with him ,leagueoflegends
939125,Pawn learned how to azir from the one in biofrost's stream lol,leagueoflegends
939132,Like do you not know much about league or just not much about professional league? I can help ya either way if you want to pm me ,leagueoflegends
939147,You don't want them to be debating? I feel like that's the most interesting part in talkshows.,leagueoflegends
939160,Now we just need a Supp darkin and a Mid darkin and we can have the five darkin as a team\n,leagueoflegends
939349,I like how SSG remembered how Kalista synergies well with ardent censer so that's why they use that to their advantage,leagueoflegends
939356,You do recognize my username do you? ,leagueoflegends
939392,Ruler killed it this game,leagueoflegends
939475,Didn't take long,leagueoflegends
939485,Pawns Azir and Deft's Cailtyn was hot shit,leagueoflegends
939757,stfu ,leagueoflegends
940077,Smeb/Pawn suicide tower diving Crown is my kind of fiesta.,leagueoflegends
940120,You should try putting them to middle mouse click and the side buttons,leagueoflegends
940239,First comment in game 1 thread jinxed KT,leagueoflegends
940371,Well some of G2 made it ,leagueoflegends
940443,Still confused as to why SSG did so well in Spring with mainly Haru though... He was bodying teams with Rengar and aggressive junglers.,leagueoflegends
940828,dirty\n,leagueoflegends
940865,Someone actually said during quarterfinals when Azir was being played that they were excited for KT because Pawn has the best Azir in the world.,leagueoflegends
940874,&gt; the sake of variety when there was no reason for it\n\nlmao you literally just said the reason it was changed and then said there was no reason.,leagueoflegends
941043,50 minute video ,leagueoflegends
941219,Haru's fine in certain metas.,leagueoflegends
941696,Kayn or Lucian adc...,leagueoflegends
941735,The darkins name isn't varus right? All three of them together make up varus,leagueoflegends
941743,There was an article 2 years ago or last year that Marin already served the army.,leagueoflegends
941782,because in spring aggressive junglers were strong? ,leagueoflegends
941784,Because Ambition made Ruler go off on Kalista right?,leagueoflegends
941851,KT LULSTER is back,leagueoflegends
941981,feels bad man,leagueoflegends
942001,apparently kt thought picking jarvan and shen over kalista is better. ok.,leagueoflegends
942177,Maybe Betsy beacuse of blanc go to Roccat,leagueoflegends
942212,In current lore she is not a darkin but riot might just rewrite it \n\nhe isn't fully in control of his body yet and might be because his host isn't normal it's a body he made using 2 hosts \n\n,leagueoflegends
942215,Any chance of The Dive as podcast on spotify?,leagueoflegends
942223,Not banning Kalista is cancer,leagueoflegends
942500,Meta has changed,leagueoflegends
942535,101 makes sense in binary,leagueoflegends
942601,Thanks for reminding me how riot made trundle from being a guy that takes one for his whole tribe and having a reason for the poop pylon into a war mongering frozen troll.,leagueoflegends
942723,Not in a bad way but I'm surprised to see how many people actually read and are invested in the lores. I've always just been about playing the game but I don't know anything about the actual story behind it. What makes you guys interested in reading all these champs stories?,leagueoflegends
942732,Shadow Assassin (Kayne) is also pretty decent.\n\nAnd Varus is a very good midlaner (but depends on meta and itembuild),leagueoflegends
942768,but they are the best numbers\n,leagueoflegends
943067,jax is a teenage mutant ninja turtle,leagueoflegends
943318,XXXpecial,leagueoflegends
943336,I mean not their fault. Teams forgot about Kalista perm banned/first pick status after worlds. Credit to SSG for opening their eyes again.,leagueoflegends
943537,[removed],leagueoflegends
943617,Highly doubt Pawn is the best anything in the world.,leagueoflegends
943828,&gt;I really hope this doesn't become a trend of riot changing champions this much.\n\nYou must care so much about the lore to not have noticed that it's been constantly changing for the last 5 years.\n\nRemember when Trundle was a diseased troll who tried to be a hero then grew to resent his own race so much that he elected to doom them to extinction? Remember when Galio was a motivated by the murder of his creator? Remember when Warwick was a wolfman because Soraka cursed him?,leagueoflegends
943917,Someone got excited for KT LUL Ster,leagueoflegends
943952,fly^2,leagueoflegends

945675,A Wallpaper Engine implementation would be sweet !,leagueoflegends
945878,they already lost Game 2 ... he fucking got excited dumb ass ,leagueoflegends
945965,It's a Chinese guy who hates the Taiwanese people I remember reading somewhere about him in another post,leagueoflegends
946047,Nah he's with his boy Adrian on EF ,leagueoflegends
946167,Imagine if QT was on their roster,leagueoflegends
946301,Then you haven't experienced it,leagueoflegends
946349,Almost the end of 2017 had to make someone gay in league or riot would look like a homophobe.  ,leagueoflegends
946988,dudes a heroin smuggler in china now,leagueoflegends
947052,Maybe I am maybe I am not do you know? I will tell you i didnt lose to a garen for at least half a Year tho.,leagueoflegends

947396,It's absolutely nothing new that people love lore,leagueoflegends

947856,Summoner Eugene!,leagueoflegends
947880,heh,leagueoflegends
947907,ok so you gave up a kalista janna lane which is cancer. why dont you pick a super aggresive bot lane like a leona or alistar and get the jungler to camp the shit out of your lane to shut them down early so you snowball off that? kt looked like they lost this game since draft rather than samsung winning it. \n\nand we all got excited...,leagueoflegends
947971,So how much did you care about Warwick's new lore when he got his VU?,leagueoflegends
947976,[deleted],leagueoflegends
948003,[deleted],leagueoflegends
948128,[deleted],leagueoflegends
948138,Guessing this was made for fujoshits,leagueoflegends
948236,Really? Cause I read the stories and love didn't beat shit,leagueoflegends
948346,i guess they could but i don't think they will as i think that would make all the ionian champs way too edgy. if anything a darkin yordle would be way better.,leagueoflegends
948498,Jax didnt choose to use no weapon but was rather forced into this decision because he was too good (iirc),leagueoflegends
948608,You missed a rickroll opportunity here,leagueoflegends
948790,What? Geen resultaten gevonden,leagueoflegends
948949,don't change my leona she's perfect =/,leagueoflegends
948957,XD,leagueoflegends
949102,Old varus killed a lot more guys in his old lore and was bound by honor to let his family die but when everything is gone he gave into revenge. Now his two gay dudes alone in the world. ,leagueoflegends
949291,Tracer being gay is ok because it didn't go against her lore. Varus being gay required an entire new backstory that is rather confusing and quite boring imo.,leagueoflegends
949328,Du...elender Mistkerl :D,leagueoflegends
949388,I have a beard. Ornn has a beard. ,leagueoflegends
949451,It also looks like the nami bubble. Found this out in an aram game where like 7 out of the 10 champs were running arcane comet and it was really confusing. I ended up spending so much time trying to dodge everything cuz the visual noise was too much,leagueoflegends
949518,He was sacrificed to the korean gods tp bring in papasmithy (bless),leagueoflegends
949631,"I love this I really do. I want to reply to half of the comments with \""quick - give me one fact about varus' wife that isnt the fact that she existed and was his wife\""\n\nPeople would struggle because she wasnt a character she was a background plot device. Such a tragedy that she was replaced oh no.",leagueoflegends

950603,I hate the name love the team.,leagueoflegends
950684,It\u2019s the league community they will get mad over everything just look at Zoe. Everyone was super hyped for her and now everyone cry\u2019s that she\u2019s OP and not fair. ,leagueoflegends
950721,I hate people like you OP because you're one of the people that think complex always beat simplicity. Complex doesn't always mean better and some things can be straight to the point and be good. None of the clutter is necessarily needed. ,leagueoflegends
950724,I have the same respect for kassadin aswell .. a single look at the void fucked up malzahar completly and the guy from that nami comic while he just used the power to make himself stronger while keeping his sanity ( even tho his new lore states that his days are numbered)\n\nAlso i wonder if it's his shadow powers or just his pure ego that is keeping Rhaast from controlling him .. and if shadows can cleanse the scyth from Rhaast how strong is Zed when he is the master of them ,leagueoflegends
950779,Anivia's true counter is Kassadin tho,leagueoflegends

951042,cool.  thanks for the info.  any idea where that phrase comes from? \n\nIm old.  Captain jack is a nickname for heroine. ,leagueoflegends
951090,I don't know if this is true but it might be if you haven't seen it rotate in two weeks. It's supposed to rotate on a weekly basis. ,leagueoflegends
951317,Why is this cinematic released before his update is in place? This will probably confuse either new players or players getting into the lore.,leagueoflegends
951400,Hope she\u2019s gay as well. ,leagueoflegends
951454,"I chime \""neither is Varus!\""",leagueoflegends

952791,It does! I used to use a scrollbar in CSGO until one of my friends pointed out it's insanely slow. I now use numbers for weapons and mouse buttons for individual grenade types to make sure I pull the right thing when I need to. Mouse wheel is also bound to jump now for me in fps games!,leagueoflegends
952872,So......is Varus ghey?,leagueoflegends
952931,There is a megathread by the mods. Is the 2nd post you find on the sub.,leagueoflegends
952939,it's not true we just want kassadin's daughter to be a thing ,leagueoflegends
953256,I don\u2019t mind debate.  But it\u2019s not debate. It\u2019s arguing and usually only about opinions which makes no sense to argue about   At least the scenarios I\u2019m talking about. Usually Kelsey gets too defensive over her opinions and won\u2019t let anyone else have their own ,leagueoflegends
953372,Wtf are you talking about he only played one game of yasuo and not because hes a resource hog but to answer the gnar pick(Yasuo is gnar lane counter).He played a lot of tanks too in lck and worlds.Its almost like you only watch a few skt games at world then try to analyze him as a player.He's changed a lot since he got in to skt roster.Your description might apply to fnatic or immortal huni but not his current form.,leagueoflegends
953440,might be true,leagueoflegends
953511,why people even care about lore in MOBA game? in DOTA for example its basically nonexistent and nobody cares,leagueoflegends

Yep; that was me. And ofc; once you're flagged for 14 days; you're flagged by Riot to keep watch so he quickly got perma'ed after.,leagueoflegends

959507,My point is stop talking as if importing Koreans do not work. It can work and it worked before. That is why teams are betting on them not for only for local talents. Claiming that you would do better or would have done better with only EU players is an assumption at best. There is no basis for it since season 2 except Origen. ,leagueoflegends

960964,We know hes probably going to get a visual update (based on rioter's comments on other threads) but it still feels bad that his family is just not a thing anymore. Him looking at his amulet while idle or recalling was tragic and felt like it meant something. It'll probably be removed with the update.

962989,The lore is cool and all but the in-game character probably won't be as cool after it gets updated. No more tragic amulet idle/recall animation and his voice lines won't make sense so they'll probably be changed to something regarding the 3 talking (maybe 3 voice actors?),leagueoflegends

963992,Great interview. I have full confidence in Seb's ability to manage CG. He's a Yale grad with a pretty good track record. ,leagueoflegends
964063,So she needs to get level 9 before she can get ignite or she needs to put 3 points in W before she can get ignite? \n\nEither way why would Red/Blue Smite be in the last tier? Also this means that early game her chance of getting a crappy spell is much higher than lategame. I feel like this would make her pretty unviable (at least with the setup you describe) as getting a decent spell off her W is an essentialy part to her Laning phase. If she gets Clarity for the first two items she should already be so far behind that there will be no way for her to ever get back. \n\nEDIT: Also what about Gunblade dropss etc? They just only drop if she has a gunblade or how do I need to understand this? ,leagueoflegends
964093,If he had a 49% win rate in his prime then he wasn\u2019t broken. Even in high elo people were winning against good azir players like easyhoon. Hell even in lower elo all I had to do is pick xerath.,leagueoflegends
964161,We could do something along the lines of using the Youtube stream and showing like the in-game clock and having people sync to it. Not a lot of people like having multiple tabs open though in my experience. Its also nice to have the Vods to look back at when going over mistakes in a cast during a review.   ,leagueoflegends
964316,I'm surprised no one mentions Score.. He was invisible and let Gragas farm.. They had losing lanes and he just farmed and failed a gank top. The only hope was him to gank SSG lanes early game.

990123,there are many things you can say about his old lore but unique is not one of them.  it was so very cliche.  if they had just slapped darkin on the corruption it would have come off as extremely lazy.  this lore gives us a more interesting dynamic and an opportunity for darkin lore development.  his lore didn't even make sense anymore after the retcon of the summoners.  nobody complained about the change in lore for renekton and nasus when it changed nearly everything about them and their dynamic but this one makes varus gay and people need to a shout at the world from their closet.,leagueoflegends

So he threw it all away he didn't cry or wish to change what he did he moved forward he took what power he could and hunted those that murdered all he loved. That's some legendary shit right there now whats the story we get two named but unimportant warriors who love each other and when one was on the brink of death they sought help from a temple only to unleash a unspeakable evil blah blah blah shit is boring and in fact the only part interested is that they are dudes that love each other.

1013858,MF being busted since Aery &amp; Sorcery introduction probably also helps. Doing 100+ dmg on 1st AA at lvl 1 is pretty hard to play into when pro players usually aren't trading over multiple AAs.,leagueoflegends

1014109,Galio isn't global though it's more like pantheons which is a lot less strong. \n\nShen his ult being global is that he can force all ins on every lane if he can give his TP shield. It's pretty broken how much pressure he exceeds just by having his ultimate available in competitive play. \n\nGalio's ultimate is strong but it's super strong because it gives a lot of damage % reduction which just makes your ADC nearly unkillable for 4 seconds. I believe Galio would be much easier to balance for solo and competitive play if they removed the 20/30/40% (plus % MR of Galio) part of Galio's ultimate and shifted some of that power onto his other abilities. ,leagueoflegends

1033087,People would've been justifiably upset if this had been done in reverse though and a gay character had been retconned to be straight. Admittedly Valmar and Kai are new characters but that just invites question why did they need to be introduced as part of *Varus's* lore rather than as a new champion. They could've kept Varus as an individual human with a similar origin to before that was forced into a gestalt with the darkin. That would've been in keeping with the old lore and let them distinguish Varus from Kayn by having the personality in control of Varus be much more fluid. They could still have done the two lovers in the same body concept in a slightly different way but I don't really see why it needed to be done **here**.,leagueoflegends

1073154,[Here's a quick explanation](http://roc.gg/ROCProfit),leagueoflegends

1073457,[removed],leagueoflegends
1073476,He was a god in Spring\n,leagueoflegends
1073710,Imagine if i had a real D.,leagueoflegends
1073754,I can try to explain it more. In sports you do not want players swap too much during the season. To keep a competitive integrity you do not want that the richest organization can simply buy the best players off other teams at any time. Just think about how it would suck when Team Liquid would face Cloud9 in semi finals of LCS and they buy Sneaky just right before the game. To avoid such things organisations are only allowed to discuss contracts with players if they have permission of their team or if players are currently free agents. Poaching means your try to negotiate and somewhat steal a player at a time that is not appropriate. Players as well as all organizations have to honor their contracts and such rules help to have a stable environment to do business. Otherwise organizations would not invest that much in salaries and players. ,leagueoflegends

1142778,I feel like bruiser/tank Fizz top has a chance of coming back next patch.\n\nNow for those that don't know when Fizz was nerfed his W passive DoT went from 85 at max rank to 60 at max rank and his empowered W went from 255 at max rank to 180. This shutdown Tank fizz in one swoop.\n\nWhen the next patch comes out sun fire capes dmg is basically going to be revered to before mid season(12-25 dmg and 200% bonus dmg to minions - 50% bonus dmg to minons.)\n\nThis gives a lot of dmg back to Fizz(and other tanks of course) but is really just the tip of the iceberg(a really small iceberg that is). Anouther item Fizz didn't have access to before he died was Abyssal  Mask(as it was shipped in midseason patch along with the sunfire nerfs and in the patch after Fizz got gutted like a fish). And as his core Triforce is still in a good patch I'd assume he'd grab that too.\n\n\nAlong with the Runes being in a fabulous spot for him(Grasp is always good on him when a Tanky build is viable and he's probably the second best user of Sudden Impact as he can keep it up nearly permenantly with his 3 dashes and does a lot of both magic and physical damage. ) \n\nAny thoughts? Any reason it shouldn't work?\n\nEDIT: Has anyone realized one of OP.GG's slides on the front page is a game of Bruiser Fizz lol,leagueoflegends

Like Lucian lost his wife which is awful but they were ghost hunters. They risked their lives every day. Varus was a warrior and his wife was a homemaker and his kid was just a kid yknow. Idk.

1156302,No. I don't think I've ever been as impressed by a Liquid roster. Investing your resources in a star who wasn't picked up in his own region and doesn't speak English seems inherrently riskier than five players who have proved they work in the context of NA. Liquid also always had some clear weaknesses. Lourlo and Goldenglue were sub par solo lanes.,leagueoflegends
1156480,Blank better get used to being starter. He looked good when he's a sub making him look like a savior if they win. \n\nBut how'd he do as a starter again without having to watch the jungle pathing backstage? We'll answer that in S8.,leagueoflegends

So i dont give a damn if varus now has 2 gay lovers or whatever. For all i care he could be Adolf of Noxious and it wouldnt interest me. Riot really failed the lore department.

They're also easy to gank with Camille's gank setup but forget about 1v1ing her if she has more than 3 brain cells. Another annoying thing is that for whatever reason it's hard for her to draw minion aggro. Might be simply because of her extraordinarily long range(toplane-wise)\n\nVayne can:\n\na) Condemn Camille out of her own ulti\n\nb) Stealth during Q2 which negates 60% of her damage\n\nc) Dodge Camille E with her Tumble if she's far away from the wall when it's easily readable and telegraphed\n\nd) Condemn Camille into the wall if Camille tries to make her E unreadable by standing near the wall\n\nIf for some reason you miss E and don't hit her you're absolutely fucked and won't ever win a trade.

Change lucian not graves then.\n\nSadly though.. graves woulda never have gotten the victorious skin if he isn\u2019t who he is today.

His game knowledge is really high and his leadership is good but his mechanics are not great for an lcs caliber player.

1432643,Absolutely agreed.\n\nThey could literally have kept every aspect of Varus and changed the pit of Pallas to be a darkin and everything would work the way they wanted since they think he absolutely has to be a darkin for some reason.

1434424,This performance at worlds was bangs second poor performance. When he was first brought on to SKT he was known as a complete laning god who was amazing at team fights. Only pray and gorilla were able to match or beat him (look at last year ROX vs SKT semi finals). He's still very good and far better than 95% of all ADC. The problem is purely that all of the BEST ADC are in Korea so the second he let's his form decline it shows. It's not like he's in NA and can consistently crush like doublelift because the competition always sucks. ,leagueoflegends

The mage cast a spell of infestation on N'aix to escape but his mind got stuck in the pure madness of N'aix. \nHaving the mage infest him awoke his mind and will to escape.

1575262,I stopped playing league for a year and only came back 2 weeks ago with not much play time so I don\u2019t know to much but isn\u2019t this what\u2019s preseason is about? Every year big changes happen and something is always broken or something is really weak. Shouldn\u2019t they just give it time for more patches before they rage at the state of the game?

1592698,And this is the problem with league in general people have to determine the strengths of regions based on a double round robin bo1. In no other sport is it like that. You have a variety of international tournaments where story lines get built and you see either new champions or a single teams dominance. At some point RIOT is going to have to consider adding more international tournaments and shortening the lcs splits. Not only is it better for the fans it is also better for the players because they do not burn out as fast.,leagueoflegends

1600678,I've read through a good number of these comments and I think I have a reasonable rubric for how to tastefully add in an LGBTQ character.\n\n1. Make sure you don't overwrite another characters lore.  Honestly they should have learned this from the influx of posts talking about how the Urgot rework killed his backstory.\n\n2. Don't mess up your ratios.  1/139 characters is a little much don't you think?  Maybe get a stronger base of heterosexual characters first.\n\n3. Don't shove their sexual preference in my face.  Xayah and Rakan are a couple but without reading every tidbit of lore you wouldn't even know because the writers didn't make a big deal out of it.,leagueoflegends
1600918,[removed],leagueoflegends

As far as old lore related stuff hinted that Ez and Lux had a crush on each other and we know that Zoe has a crush on Ez.\n\nI think the bigger question is why do you care? You\u2019re clearly not that invested in the lore and who gives a shit if Riot wants to appeal to a broader audience? This line of dialogue like you guys are protecting everyone from the PR boogeyman by calling out them trying to appeal to more people is weird to me. Everyone knows that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing.

1694000,I really like that one Jaximus quote ,leagueoflegends
1694046,Teemo is not broken. His win rate is only 52% which is where it was before the pre-season changes. Bruisers just need better mastery options. Nerfing Teemo before they adjust top lane runes will just result in an overnerfed Teemo that is unplayable.,leagueoflegends

1707036,quite a lot of ppl always agreed with him\n\nnot really because of his good ideas tho (like bruisers being in a bad spot or items getting changed because of adcs using them or whatever)\n\nppl mostly agree on stuff like: just nerf all strong early game champs that are played in top lane. like just take a look at this recent changelist. those changes are absolutely ridiculous and ppl seem to like it just because they dont want to play against some champs (or dont want to learn how to play vs them) even though those champs are fine,leagueoflegends
1707461,where else is there for them to go? H2K and Vitality are the only teams we know of where the toplaner hasn't been heavily rumored and I feel like Vitality are totally comfortable trying to keep Cabo.,leagueoflegends
1707576,Because people kept citing his stupid win-loss when he barely did anything huge to help the team win. He was not very good when he played but he had a very nice win-loss ratio so people just claimed he was better suited than Huni and probably never watched the guy.,leagueoflegends

1717873,Isn't that the point of it all though? These are all people who are mostly bruiser players. They are complaining that braindead tanks and ranged champs dominate the top lane right now. Bruisers and Fighters got fucked over so hard by the new runes because now they don't have anything as good as the rest of those champs. Literally every single champ you named except Sion is a champ that Hashinshin has talked about in another video. Is it so wrong for them to complain when an entire subclass of champions that all of them enjoy playing got dicked over by runes? Seriously just listen to yourself. Maybe consider your bias as well ,leagueoflegends

The closest we have is shaco and tbh old Eve was the closest with her ability to pop up and ult the team. More so Ive wanted the character design though. Floaty xenomorph thingy.\n\nI feel like lane minions have some good unexplored space too.

1938890,&gt;55% winrate against 23 champions\n\nLet's look at the overall winrate against all champions for those 23 champions:\n\n1. Vayne (Top Lane) - 44.33% (**)\n2. Renekton - 46.68% ($$)\n3. Garen - 50.5% (**)\n4. Singed - 52.63% (**)\n5. Trundle - 47.53% ($$)\n6. Poppy - 50.03% (**)\n7. Galio - 42.55% (##)\n8. Darius - 46.86% ($$)\n9. Illaoi - 51.22% (**)\n10. Tahm Kench - 49.81%\n11. Camille - 49.52% (**)\n12. Kled - 51.25% (**)\n13. Tryndamere - 45.55% (**)\n14. Nautilus - 48.02% (##)\n15. Ekko - 47.06% (##)\n16. Quinn (Top Lane) - 49.2% (**)\n17. Jax - 50.1% ($$)\n18. Mordekaiser - 51.49%\n19. Fiora - 47.33% ($$)\n20. Shen - 51.5% (**)\n21. Gankplank - 51.55% (**)\n22. Gnar - 48.21% ($$)\n23. Riven - 48.67% ($$)\n\n(**) 11 of those 23 champions are those that Teemo has always hard countered. Nothing has changed there.\n\n($$) 7 of those 23 are champions which are typically skill match-ups for Teemo but are currently suffering from loss of Fervor and lack of an acceptable replacement. Teemo versus these champions typically hovers somewhere around ~50%. Notice that the overall winrate for these champions versus all champions is low meaning that these champs are not just suffering versus Teemo but are weak in general. \n\n(##) 3 of these champions seem to be having a really rough time right now versus everyone else in the game. \n\nThe last 2 champions (Mordekaiser and Tahm Kench) are not often seen in top lane and probably don't have a lot of people maining them in that position while there are a ton of Teemo top lane mains with hundreds of games. \n\nWhat I'm trying to point out is that you have 10 of those 23 champions having a really rough time right now and shit win rates against every champion in the game. \n\nTL;DR: Don't nerf Teemo until we find an acceptable replacement for Fervor because lack of a good keystone for many top lane champs is the reason Teemo is strong right now - not his kit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,leagueoflegends

1965025,I was just wanting to see where the majority stood with a poll. That is what I am curious about.\n\nI think that franchising would lead to stability and good talent development in a scene that isn't guaranteed to have long term popularity. This could extend the life time of the league and gain more dedicated fans.\n\nI do appreciate your points and I actually am very fascinated by the relegation system. I support both methods but I just support franchising a little bit more.,leagueoflegends
1965381,It's more like a skin *point*,leagueoflegends
1965952,Or it's because a lot of players like to immerse themselves in lore and dislike that this feels like a forced change on an already good lore. \n\nI honestly don't get why they wouldn't just update the old lore for Varus and make this lore for a new champion.,leagueoflegends

You're such a refreshing style and you provide some really in depth knowledge in a clear way. Since then you've only improved. Sometimes you get a little over the top with the horrible jokes but that's all part of it. The disappointed groan just means you did good.

Then to turn around and say why does them being gay matter anyways. Baseless conjecture bit is my interpretation of what them being gay actually adds to the story for better or worse.\n\n&gt;I'm ready for my downvotes now\n\nReddit tends to be accepting of irregular sexualities and welcomes them with open arms.

1990598,i get that it is currently too hard to actually win top lane against a tank. what i am saying is that the price of crit items as well as the price of triforce and hydra is justified. if anything i'd say tank items cost too little and are too easy to build. if armor items cost like 3100 instead of 2900 that would already be a good start. i simply object buffing items that are already good simply because another class of champion has tools that are even better.,leagueoflegends

2078943,If they planned it better we would have new ability names and a remodel. They obviously arent going to since they made the comic with Varus looking the same. \n\nNothing about Varus reads darkin to me when you compare him to Aatrox and Rhaast. \n\nI know its a big step remodelling for a lore change but if they wanted the community to fully get on board with the changes this kind of action should have been taken.\n\nI would have loved to have seen a model adjustment representing the struggle between the humans and the darkin. Like Varus having half a darkin face with one horn and his arm and bow looking more darkin than corrupt.\n\nIf they gave more thought to Val and Kai looking different that also could have been represented in the model.,leagueoflegends
2079098,That's probably Aatrox's old lore before the Darkin were more fleshed out,leagueoflegends

2080442,Not if he goes the build korean tops went on him specifically to destroy tanks... tear&gt;pen item&gt;cleaver&gt;ldr and finish manamune somewhere in there when its near stacked.  Alternatively you can also go penn item&gt;cleaver&gt;botrk&gt;ldr. Tank will never be able to win the 1v1 in either scenario. Jayce will still scale far too well into the late game for how strong he is in the early and mid game.,leagueoflegends

2083010,No on gave a shit about it when they were doing nothing with lore. Now people are mad that it is changing. Obviously OG players like Journal of Justice and other lore related content. The way I see it Riot wouldn't be changing it if they didn't have a big picture plan in mind. Also new players don't care about 2011 champion lore and progression this is more for them ,leagueoflegends

2097879,well I came back to lol after about 5 months and I am leaving again after about a week (been doing that since 2015).

She has clear strengths and weaknesses that can be exploited or which you can fall prey to if you misplay.,leagueoflegends
2098836,You can actualt QR and if you do it quick enough your R will ensure the Q hits.

2121800,"Right now yes... but Darius in the past hasn't had so many issues... and his issues are usually niche picks like I've heard many times since posting this \""But but but Kennen beats him\""  Kennen is considered stronger and more meta right now than he has been in probably a year and his pickrates like 2% ... \n\nI'd actually say darius is a very safe if not the SAFEST (NON TANK) TOP PICK for LOW ELO (Gold and below) tbh that's what he is a low elo monster that punishes bad spacings and poor kiting.  There was a thread on the front page just a week ago give or take of this subreddit mentioning how Darius is in a bad spot right now... but the post also mentioned on how in almost every single patch since the juggernaut rework with few to no exceptions darius has had 50% winrate or above typically closer to 52%  and also with a high pickrate usually putting him in the top 10 if not the top 5  most picked toplaners... That goes for Plat+ and Bronze-Gold btw...  Granted most of the plat+ darius' are really just low Diamond and Plat flooding out the stats... but really until like Diamond 4 Darius is a pretty reliable pick there's also a reason early last year the big youtuber HuzzyGames mained Darius all the way to Diamond 1 ~90 LP before Darius got nerfed...

2138185,This is good. If Mr. Zoe and Yasuo made another champion I'd just give up on this game...\n\n\nWhy does Riot still have the guy... \n\nThinking about it's probably because his overtuned-cancer champions sell really well despite being bad for the general health of the game.,leagueoflegends
2138457,That's what I figured... but I don't know the specific timing windows on such off memory to comment on if one should have a slight advantage one way or the other... like Fiora is one of my msot playeds so I know Fiora vs Jax is a skill match up I'd personally say leans slightly towards Jax's favor like  48/52 at worse(implying closer to 50:50 if not)... simply because Jax E has a 1 second reactivation window vs Fiora's W's .75 second parry window means once you've got the mind game down jax has the slight advantage but Fiora's kit otherwise gives her a bit more anyway.,leagueoflegends

Maybe i'm wrong but its been forever since it had any major balance update and it certainly hasn't ever been a 'competitive' game mode despite it having ranked. It was promising when it was still in beta but as soon as it was released officially the Treeline feels like its been pretty much forgotten.  ,leagueoflegends

The times where I was able to keep relatively even/in range of 30 cs of the jayce and not die whether because I got jungler help or the jayce was not that good I could beat up the jayce by 2 items.

2379759,Except they weren't in a similar situation at all... They still spiked at 3 items and were strong champions late game. Bruisers don't spike at 3 items... Bruisers don't suddenly become good champions late game like adcs did. Even when adcs were at their worst it was because snowballing made the other ADC impactful mid game while you were worthless till your spike. And to prove this point repeatedly i would play Adc in season 6&amp;7 and get consistently high winrates. Fuck in season 6 i duoed with my friend a support main and got a quadra kill everyday for over a week straight as jinx at around 15 minutes. Even at their worst they were still GOOD.,leagueoflegends

(Which would then be completely worn and torn) Or perhaps if the one originally inside the host was strong enough to kick out the other due to being with the host and had the other darkin find another host and pairing up with it seeking vengeance against the original host darkin creating enemies within the darkin race with perhaps a double release on champs,leagueoflegends

2433124,Heimer feels like the absolute best champion to use this rune on since his turret placements always get fucked up by cannon minions and this lets you remove a cannon minion every few waves +get 4% more dmg on each type of creep. And even then i still take the free super boots cuz it feels more impactful. Im hoping they'll make it more appealing\n\nedit/ It also just feels BAD to have in the laning phase when you wanna buy control wards + dorans / dark seal / amp tome/ longswords / cull etc and is even WORSE when you have klepto (cuz you want to keep your inventory as free as possible)\nI would honestly be tempted to pick it up if they made it not count for your 6 inventory slots somehow or tied it into your trinket ? idk im baked just brainstorming \n\nI guess some champs can use it for that little extra dmg to oneshot the ranged creeps and to prevent getting pushed in too hard vs losing match-ups. Some ranged supports *might* want it to easily proc targons on cannon (free boots/market probably still better since you are $$ starved but eh) ,leagueoflegends

Doesn't really do much and might put off a few people unnecessarily. \n\nAlso agreed with the whole change thing...a guy playing this character or maining Varus for years suddenly has to accept that the character he plays is gay.

2529713,First of all there is nothing toxic about burst mage supports on the ocntrary I think it was great when they the support role expanded by these champions which makes matches with higher variety which I think a lot of people enjoy - me included.\n\nThey still require gold to do solid damage that's why there are gold gain items as well as runes and such. Thye are much slower at reaching their peak because they have low gold income.\n\nHaving some champions with higher base dmg value is nothing bad. It agains adds better variability to LoL. If you can't play around it then you just need get more practice.\n\nIt would be a sadly boring game if everything was equalized evenly. It could be a league of one champion for all players then.\n\nWhen it comes to Zoe she might be a bit too high at bursting but if she lands her entire combo she will burst you and I mean Lux or Zoe? There are other champions too.\n\nSo they might shift her numbers a bit around into more scaling or CDs early but I certainly hope she remains a glass cannon and a cannon needs to hit hard as hell.\n\nBut well different opinions I guess.,leagueoflegends

I really do think her kit allows for alot of skill expression and fairly little counterplay sometimes. I really do have issues with it but that being said in the preseason Irelia is currently my most played champion and I was actually just debating changing my Flair to her because of it (and the fact I commonly get flack for the Yasuo one) ...  Also do note my comment was speaking \""Historically\"" more referring to season 6 and early 7 basically from the Marksmen update to the tank update...

2683655,I didn't dismiss your comments. I just said your 1 million mastery points means nothing by itself.\n\nMaokai and ornn arent counters they are just overturned..\n\nI think you need to work on wave management of you can only squeeze a 10 cs lead from a Jarvan farming exclusively with q. \n\nTbh most plat players have no idea how to manage waves you could easily up that 10cs lead to 20 with knowing how to crash.\n\nIts not about after first back cause teemo usually forces you out of lane before you have an efficient back... That's the point.,leagueoflegends

2704730,I think they already confirmed he's getting a new splash art on the Varus sub. Most of all I just wanted a texture update. ,leagueoflegends
2705224,This is exactly my thoughts. They didnt need to kill Varus. The problem with the new one is that they gave more lore to Val and Kai instead of Varus. Varis got dumped down to become a sadistic demon whose motive is to kill people because he loves killing. Tell me that isn't cliche. I didn't need Kai and Val. I wanted a comple Varus character with a deep and relatable backstory. Instead we got a couple who hot consumed by a demon whose only motive is killing humans because humans are bad yet he was the one who started killing them. Now tell me that isn't cliche and confusing.,leagueoflegends

2743691,Yeah. They didnt need to kill Varus. The problem with the new one is that they gave more lore to Val and Kai instead of Varus. Varis got dumped down to become a sadistic demon whose motive is to kill people because he loves killing. Tell me that isn't cliche. I didn't need Kai and Val. I wanted a complete Varus character with a deep and relatable backstory. Instead we got a couple who got consumed by a demon whose only motive is killing humans because humans are bad yet he was the one who started killing them. Now tell me that isn't cliche and confusing.\n\nOld Varus made so much more sense and was so much more relatable. I loved how the different emotions Varus went through were described. New lore gives us emotions too but I just don't relate to them in any way. Old Varus had so much potential with his gritty and tragic and even a bit grey back story. Imagine getting a comic and a music video with Varus's village getting destroyed and with Varus desperately fighting against the Noxian invaders while his family is getting slaughtered. That would be so cool and emotional. After that it would show Varus's walking through the smoking ruins of his home and being devastated with grief and anger. And finally succumbing to the corruption he tried so hard to keep hidden. And then some of his old quotes and you have a grade A comic/video.,leagueoflegends

Sure we may get a Darkin botlane with interactions via VO but i doubt it would be to the extent of X and R. In the making of X and R it was said they wanted this element to be unique and symbolic. Giving it away wouldnt achieve that.

I listened to the entire thing while I was at the gym earlier and there was SO MUCH important and relevant information and discussion that has been boiled down to \u201cwell hashinshin is always bitching\u201d or \u201cwow tanks OP duh of course\u201d.\n\nSo bad. So so bad. They mentioned so many possible and SIMPLE balance tweaks to problem champions to keep them balanced into ranged match ups while allowing bruisers to also be viable and I see NONE OF THAT in the comment section. \n\nThis is partly because of the length of the video no doubt. But it\u2019s also typical of reddit to meme and trash on the content without giving the meat of the video any recognition. ,leagueoflegends

So stacked that G2 picked up the 6th best bot lane as a commitment to success.\n\nThis is the second super team Vander has been on in 2 years. He is not going to be the key to success on that team.

It's at least decent to the point I don't feel like it needs a change made to it.\n\nPeople don't realize how scary this rune can be and how easily it can get out of control. This rune is completely viable due to it removing cannon minion instantly. It will shove the lane in your favor no matter what.\n\nAnother thing is that this rune brings out very interesting new squishy ranged supports to bottom lane that are able to now get past laning phase due to relic (hp/sustain) and push potential. I'll be pretty sad if it gets completely changed or buffed over the top.,leagueoflegends
