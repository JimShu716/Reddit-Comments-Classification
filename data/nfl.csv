Given a decent O-line I don't see how he isn't at least a serviceable back for at least a few more years. It will be interesting to see how they use him thoguh. There is legit concern about how many touches he needs to be effective. Does he need 30 a game to ensure he hits that home run? Or is still effective at 15-20? IDK, but it should be fun to watch.

1623,"I hate this excuse. I get it the Oline is important but great RBs are making shit happen regardless. 

Jamaal Charles perfect example.

2010 He ran for 1120 yards and averaged 5.9 ypc. The Chiefs Oline that year was [ranked 29th](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/ol2009) in the NFL at run blocking. 2012 they move up to 19th and Jamaal runs for 1509 yards and averages 5.3ypc

The rams line was also ranked 29th last year and maybe they were worse than that 2012 chiefs line (even though we had literally no other offensive option than JC).... Todd Gurley didn't do anything to help himself though. His [stats on FO](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/rb) have him as the 37th ranked RB last season. Compare that to [2010 Jamaal Charles](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/rb2010) who remember also had the 29th ranked Oline in the NFL.... yet JC finished 1st in DVOA. 

Simple fact is yeah the Rams Oline is trash but Gurley was also trash last season and didn't do a damn thing to help. This sums it up

&gt;In the entire history of the NFL, there are 320 instances of a running back accumulating at least 275 carries in a single season. Among these 320 seasons, Gurley’s 2016 season ranks fifth-worst in yards per carry.

Again the line sucks but Gurley also sucked last season.",nfl

Although the business model is not even close to comparable to other companies, its interesting to look at the salaries of top CEOs/COOs/CFOs/etc at other companies.  
  
For instance, if my facts are right, the Microsoft CEO makes in excess of $80M/yr and he ain't racking up concussions. Microsoft is obviously a much more profitable business than the NFL, but its something to think about.",nfl

1729,"His volume stats are above average, while his efficiency stats and high volume of ints/fumbles are pretty damn bad. Eli probably doesn't get into the Hof if stats were the only deciding factor.

There is a reason, however, it is called the Hall of Fame and not the Hall of Stats. 

Eli has put together a phenomenal Ironman streak in his career. The dude takes hit after hit and has up and down seasons but he just simply never goes away. 

He led his team through the playoffs not once, but twice, and both times stopping the greatest football dynasty of this millennium in their tracks. Without Eli, things probably play out much differently. He is a household name, Walter Payton award winner, 2x SB MVP, and was directly responsible for perhaps the greatest underdog victory of all time, so I'd say despite a ton of picks and some crappy efficiency stats, he's a pretty good choice for the Hall of Fame.

It's obvious the Dolphins as a team need him to succeed, but when you look at the games last season where he played a top tier defense (Patriots x2, Seahawks, Ravens at the time) he clearly struggled. A QB in this tier should be able to win the games they're expected to (see the hot streak mid season before the Ravens game) but aren't at the next level. ",nfl

I'd be as perplexed about this even if I wasn't a Cowboys fan.  There's no denying Dak came into a perfect situation for a rookie QB, but Goff had the opposite, and even Wentz had a.rough time after the Lane suspension.

This was partly due to my suspicion that the FO was looking to get rid of him and that the team was in more of a rebuilding mode rather than a ""let's push for a SB"" mode. (Now we know they considered a trade for Romo). 

When Favre left I followed him 1st and Packers 2nd. Now that he's out, Pack is 1st, but I have to admit it doesn't feel the same.

2922,"&gt; Although the Constitution of the United States does not cite it explicitly, presumption of innocence is widely held to follow from the 5th, 6th, and 14th amendments. The case of Coffin v. United States (1895) established the presumption of innocence of persons accused of crimes.

Most modern democracies also have presumption of innocence directly written in their constitutions.

&gt; The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 11, states: ""Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defence.""

All of this taken from Wikipedia with a quick google search.

Your second comment (courts declaring people ""not guilty"" instead of ""innocent"") has nothing to do with your first comment. Presumption of innocence is a real thing, codified in many constitutions around the world, and indirectly pulled from the 5th, 6th and 14th amendment of the US constitution.

Basically, you are *presumed* innocent until proven guilty. That doesn't mean a crime didn't happen.

Civil litigation goes through the same process, it doesn't just immediately happen and the accused party is somehow now found guilty. Even in civil litigation the accused party is still innocent until a judge makes his or her decision based on the facts and evidence presented to him or her.

Yes but the original guy I was arguing with suggested that Zeke's an employee of the NFL, which is not the case. He's a member of the Cowboys organization, and just because he plays in the NFL does not give the commissioner the right to tell the Cowboys how to treat him.

&gt;okay, replace 'arrested' with 'subject of criminal investigations' if you think splitting that hair helps your argument.

I would encourage you to take a criminal justice class before you repeat the idea that ""getting arrested"" and ""being questioned"" are the same thing. 

&gt;From the entertainment company's perspective, the evidence and process of law is irrelevant.

Uh huh. So you think the NFL can investigate domestic abuse better than the police? Or do you think NFL players should be suspended whenever they're accused of something? How long should Dez's suspension be for ""the dez tape"" that never existed but made the NFL look bad very briefly?

&gt;And, again, the bad PR isn't coming from skip bayless, its coming from news sources the non-nfl fans watch, like the evening news and the newspaper.

So you think that giving Rachel Maddow and Sean Hannity the power to ruin players' careers is a good idea? Because you're literally advocating for suspending players based on what the evening news says about the NFL. What am I missing that makes this okay?

&gt;lol, You going to make this same limp excuse for Pacman Jones and Vontaze Burfict in a couple weeks, too? You probably get all teary eyed when Ray Lewis talks about the Lord, too, right?

Deflect, deflect, deflect. I think that's on page 3 of the ""I'm losing an argument on the internet, now what?"" guide. If you want to continue this line of discussion then feel free to answer my original question, copied here for your convenience: 

&gt;He wasn't questioned, detained, arrested, charged with a crime of any sort, or convicted of a crime of any sort. Yet hundreds of talking heads have crucified him for ""being in a bad place."" So we're literally punishing Zeke for being in the vicinity of a crime? Is he not allowed to leave his house?

&gt;Here's hoping his defense attorney can frame that a little better than you just did. He's under investigation for domestic assault and he goes and flashes someone's titty from behind, that she's clearly not enjoying? I'm surprised to find someone willing to defend this in light of all circumstances. And it ignores the 100mph speeding ticket, too.


Uh, what crime is Zeke's defense attorney arguing in your imagination? Because Zeke hasn't been charged with a crime. 

&gt;he goes and flashes someone's titty from behind, that she's clearly not enjoying?

I agree it's distasteful, but the woman in question has already said she's not going to press any charges. Zeke will never have to face a courtroom for that action, however distasteful it was.

As I said in my original comment, he's appealing the speeding ticket. Have you never heard of cases where speeding tickets were issued erroneously? 

&gt;I'm surprised to find someone willing to defend this in light of all circumstances.

You're innocent until proven guilty. The idea that we should punish people before they're convicted is disgusting to me. Punishment comes *after* the conviction, not before.

&gt;I said the NFL shouldnt be beholden the the court's schedule or outcome.

When investigating whether an actual crime took place, what makes you think the NFL can investigate and reach a decision in a better manner than actual police, lawyers, and judges? You're basically arguing for a kangaroo court where players go before Judge Roger and are suspended because Skip Bayless and Rachel Maddow are talking about you in a mean way. 

&gt;And if you're unaware that court timelines can be fudged by friendly judges to allow players to play, refamiliarize yourself with the Williams Wall (or just about any other college football related scandal of the last 25 years). The Williamses were supposed to be suspended all of 2009, but a judge reversed the NFL's decision and kicked the hearing out far enough for the vikes to finish their season, which ended at the NFC championship game. Then they let the NFL ban them after they were both basically retiring.

Thank you for the example, but I still don't see enough evidence that the NFL should act as a governing body more knowledgeable than the legal system.

5933,"&gt; Weather. Patriots play outside in a place that has very, very different weather compared to many other teams when it comes to the time playoffs roll around.

Absolutely. Considering Denver, NE, Seattle, and GB have had some of the best success at home in the playoffs of late and far less on the road I think that's easily a factor. Consider also that Indy, Pittsburgh, San Diego and KC(all highly successful centrally located teams) have not lived up to their home field advantage near as much in the playoffs.

&gt;Time zone changes. That late in the season, players' body clocks are used to very specific things. Denver playing a prime-time game in New England feels like the middle of the night to Denver players. It's not always that drastic, but I think the different start times and time zone changes can really mess with players.

Maybe, that would take a long time to track. Might make a different post on that one day.

&gt;Bye weeks. Getting a week to rest and prepare AND not have to travel is a huge overall advantage.

Not as much imo. I'll look into it but consider how frequently Manning's #1 seed Colts went 1 and done in the playoffs. The Broncos in 2012 and a few others come to mind as well. For a long time there was a stigma that the week off was actually a *bad* thing. 

&gt;Quality of team. Not the other teams, but the Patriots. The years they tend to get the 1 seed, they also tend to be really, really good (and generally healthy). Could be said of any team, I'm sure, but I think that the Patriots 1 seed teams have been historically good, not just pretty good.

Of course, to an extent. However, consider that in their losses they were the #2 seed in 2015, #4 playing the #3 in 2006, #2 seed in 2013, #1 seed in 2011, and 18-0 in 2007 I don't think there's been any correlation to their seeding and their losses.",nfl
5960,Can't be any worse than the decision to keep on Matt Ryan,nfl
5995,"You did but you hid that small Brees stayement in a large paragraph of misleading pro-Favre conjecture. 

First you say Brees was better for a short time. This isn't true. Brees has been better than Favre for more than a decade. That is not a short time.

Then you say that Favre should be considered one of the best QBs ever because of longevity and stats. I disagee longevity itself doesnt doesn't make a QB good and Favre's stats are closer to Jay Cutler's than any of the best QBs ever. Your argument would permit Cutler to get in the HOF if he played long enough. That's absurd.

Last, the only significant thing Favre is better than Brees at likability and arm strength. Favre's numbers are closer to Jay Cutler's than Brees, let alone the greatest QBs of all time. Likability and ""girls dig the long ball"" play style is why Favre is even in this discussion (and sadly in the HOF) because his QB efficiency numbers say he absolutely shouldn't.",nfl

LT1 -- Terron Armstead --
	Everyone knows the story by now, Armstead is a freak athlete of lineman when he is actually on the field but that is something that is becoming less and less frequent with each passing season. If Ramczyk performs well enough this season we could see another Jamal Brown/Jermon Bushrod situation that sees Armstead being traded at the end of the season. I would hate to see Armstead go but the team has proven again and again they can replace tackles fairly easy.

-

LG1 --  Andrus Peat --
	Peat has responded very well for the situation he has found himself in over the first 2 years of his career. After being bounced around every position except C over that time frame he has finally settled in as the starting LG. He has his ups and downs but hes a quality starter and will only get better as he matures.

-

C -- Max Unger--
	So Unger is a Top 10 C in the league, good at pass pro and run blocking... when he’s healthy. Hopefully, he will be available by the start of the season if not the team will be pushing out whomever looks the best by the end of TC in his stead.

-

RG1 -- Larry “War Daddy” Warford --
	A quality starter signed away from Detroit due to up and down play and injury. The Saints value guards more than most teams because of the way Brees has to move in the pocket to avoid pressure and clear his throwing lanes.  Peat and Warford should pair nicely to keep Brees clear from pressure up the middle.

-

RT1 -- Zach “Old Man” Strief --
	Strief continues to perform at an above average level despite the fact he will be 34 in September. I've always been a big fan of him and he was rewarded with a bit of a raise this offseason. He is a respected locker room presence and one of the handful of players over the age of 30 on the team. His age is the only limiting factor here and Ramczyk will be the starter sooner rather than later

-

OT -- Ryan Ramczyk -- What was going to be a potential training camp battle between Strief and Ramczyk has been put on hold for the time being as Ramczyk will be called on to start in the injured Armsteads place. He has the so called ""mass and ass"" that Sean Payton apparently looks for in a man and he looks like a good technician in the tape I've seen on him. He was ranked as the top OT in the draft by multiple picks and I really liked him at 32.

-

OT -- Bryce Harris (probable cut) -- Harris has been around the league as a spot tackle filling in for injury and bouncing off practice squads. He has appeared in a few regular season games as the Saints swing tackle. If he has a solid camp he could stick on as depth, especially considering the Saints penchant for injuries but I think he gets replaced by one of the younger linemen at this point

-

OT -- Khalif Barnes -- (probable cut, re-signed, and cut again) I cant help but respect Barnes as being a consummate professional last year. He was re-signed or cut 8 total times by the team last year.  He, Strief and Unger are the veterans of the O-line playing over 300 games combined, that is a lot of experience in the film room and on game day. Barnes will probably rotate in all season again due to injury or specific game plans, something he seems to have no problem with at this point in his career.

-

OT/G/C -- Senio Kelemete -- Senio has filled in all over the Saints line and I do mean every where. He will make the team barring injury, he is simply too versatile to not make it. He will probably be the front runner to fill in for Unger if he cant make it back in to for the start of the season.

-

OG -- Landon Turner -- A good young Guard who signed with the team as a UDFA last season. He impressed enough in TC/PS to make the roster and played in 7 games and started 1. I think he will continue to improve and be a quality backup going forward.

-

OG -- John Fullington (Probable Cut) -- Another lineman that has bounced around various practices squads in the league. I expect that to continue here, I dont see him having a legitimate chance to even show he's capable of beating out someone for their job.

-

OG -- Josh LeRibeus (Probable Cut) -- The same can be said of LeRibeus that can be said of Fullington, a journeyman OL whose been around for a few years. These spots are used by teams to evaluate and add players to their ""short list"" to sign mid-season if/when injuries dictate they need to fill a spot.

-

C -- Jack Allen (Practice Squad Candidate) -- Another UDFA signing from last year. He was on the PS for most of the year but made an active roster appearance in December. He will get the chance to compete for the backup position behind Unger.

-

C -- Chris Watt (Possible Cut) -- A player signed in FA after the Unger news broke. Watt had previously started for the Chargers before getting hurt and waived last season. The Saints were impressed enough to sign him and he will be the main challenge to Kelemete for starting in Unger's stead...if he's healthy

-

C -- Tom Cameron (Possible Practice Squad Candidate) -- The last center on the roster. A UDFA out of Southern Miss. I doubt he will seriously threaten anyone's job this year but he might find a home on the PS

Final score was 34-14 and I just caught absolute hell for the entire second half. 

Edit: Missing words",nfl
9827,"&gt; But when you have someone like Moss who is arguably the most talented WR of all time you can't not give it to him.

I get that...but for how much longer will Moss be one of the most talented of all time? I mean, we have *heaps* of hugely talented WRs in the league right now, practically one on every team. Who's to say that by the time Antonio Brown retires he won't be talked about the same way as Moss? 

While right now, I don't think there are any RBs who have played during the Peterson era who can even compare to him. 

Moss may have been more talented, but other WRs are catching up to his level of greatness, while Peterson may be less talented, but there are no other RBs right now who can sneeze at his accomplishments. ",nfl

10024,"So you resort to calling names when someone disagrees with you, but I'm the douche? Makes total sense. Sorry the truth bothers you that much.

&gt; I don't know much about his earlier career,

And I've been following his career since he was drafted. I own a Bradford jersey. I'm not the one looking in a vacuum here, I'm looking at the full body of work.

&gt; he was also statistically above average in almost every category.

Not turning the ball over and completing a lot of passes will go a long way towards those efficiency stats. But the reality is, he was average at best. That's why context matters. Comp% and YPA are directly related. The better one's comp%, the better their YPA. Sam Bradford broke the single season comp% record and had a below average YPA. That's a huge red flag.

Passer Rating and AY/A are very similar stats. They use the same base stats. One gives more weight to TD/INT ratio and puts out an arbitrary number. The other gives more weight to yards and converts TDs and INTs to yards for a yards per attempt average. In most cases, the ranking of these two stats should be very similar. Bradford was 6th in Passer Rating and 14th in AY/A. Again, a huge red flag.

That's great that Bradford doesn't turn the ball over. It's why he still has a job. But he doesn't do anything else with the ball either. Doesn't score much. Doesn't throw more than a few yards beyond the LoS much. You might as well run the ball 3 times.  I would rather have a guy with a INT% in the low 2's(Bradford's was 0.9), that actually throws the ball down field and crates plays.

Like Andrew Luck for example. And for the record, I'm not a huge Luck fan. I think he's a pretty overrated QB at this point in his career. Anyway...In 15 games for each, you lose 8% in comp% and he had a 1.5% drop in INT%. As a result, the passer rating is down a couple points as well. Who thinks Sam Bradford is a better QB than Andrew Luck? Anyone? Because for those 'flaws,' Luck had 11 more TDs(+2.1 TD%), almost 400 more yards, and half a yard more per attempt. And to show for it, he had a winning record vs Bradford's losing record. He did this behind a shitty line, only one good receiver, a shitty run game, and a shitty defense. So a pretty similar team to the Vikings, except instead of a top 5 defense, it was bottom 5. So toss that supporting cast argument right out the window.

Good QBs make their teams better.

Bradford doesn't directly lose games, but the team loses because he doesn't go out an win them either. He's a good stopgap QB, that's about it. He's the first name on the list below the Dalton line. He's the new Ryan Fitzpatrick. He's good enough to keep a job, but you're always looking for his replacement. He may put up some good stats from time to time because the potential was there, but he'll never do it consistently.

11039,"**Training Camp Battles- Defense (Part II: LB, CB, S)**


**LB: Lerentee McCray vs. Josh McNary vs. Hayes Pullard**

Telvin Smith and Myles Jack are absolute locks to make the roster. Paul Posluszny will, in all likelihood, make the roster (though it’s not a guarantee, as he is no longer the middle linebacker, and is moving to the outside, which is a new position for him). Blair Brown, the fifth round pick out of Ohio that I really like despite his size, will likely make the roster. That leaves 1 or 2 spots left. What makes things interesting is that these linebackers are known for different things, but not all of them will make the roster.

We’ll start with what most Jags fans know, and that’s Hayes Pullard. He made the roster last year after a fantastic preseason, where he [caught a touchdown pass](https://youtu.be/wEWoajhsfoY?t=1m24s) that was negated, [returned an interception for a touchdown](http://www.espn.com/blog/jacksonville-jaguars/post/_/id/18692/jaguars-giving-lb-hayes-pullard-iii-a-long-look-against-falcons), and looked incredibly solid against the second stringers. While he wasn’t known for special teams, he was good on defense; he didn’t play a whole lot in the regular season (he only had 3 tackles on the season, and has 16 tackles in 2 seasons with the Jaguars), but he shined when he got his moment in the preseason.

The problem for him is that the two guys he’s competing against are special teams aces that just so happen to be linebackers. It wouldn’t be a problem if it wasn’t for the fact that Blair Brown got drafted; when you factor in all of these things, it’s going to be tough for Pullard to make the team. A camp and a preseason like the one he had last year might not even be enough. [Audie Cole](http://www.firstcoastnews.com/sports/nfl/jacksonville-jaguars/free-agency-jaguars-lb-audie-cole-wants-to-take-care-of-business-on-special-teams/422434048) was brought in specifically for special teams, [as was linebacker Lerentee McCray](http://www.firstcoastnews.com/sports/nfl/jacksonville-jaguars/free-agency-jaguars-have-signed-lb-lerentee-mccray/421234182) and linebacker Josh McNary. One of them will be guaranteed to make the roster, and based on how bad our special teams was last year, probably both of them will make the roster (I can’t put into words how bad our special teams looked towards the middle of last season; the Jaguars got burned for one big punt return a game).

What will the Jaguars do? Will they keep two special teams aces, or one special teams ace and one guy that can be plugged in at linebacker if necessary? Pullard is going to have an uphill battle to make the roster this year, but the fact that he’s on the bubble and not an automatic cut (like a guy like PJ Davis is) is saying something about how good he looked in the preseason last year.

**CB: Jalen Myrick vs. Josh Johnson vs. Taurean Nixon**

The Jaguars will likely enter the season with five cornerbacks. Jalen Ramsey and AJ Bouye are guaranteed roster spots, and Aaron Colvin will make the roster in the final year of his contract. The final two spots, on the other hand, are up in the air. They could easily go to an UDFA or a camp body that I did not name, such as Ezra Robinson or Brian Dixon, but I doubt that any of those guys have a shot at making the roster. Then again, I didn’t think Josh Johnson had a chance in the world at making the roster last year when I made this post, and after an impressive preseason, he made (and deservedly so) the roster. Basically, when it comes to the backup cornerback battle, [listen to Kevin Garnett for advice on what could happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcz_kDCBTBk).

There are three players fighting for two spots. One of them is Josh Johnson. This man literally had no chance at making the team, but put together one of the most impressive preseason performances I’ve ever seen out of a Jaguars defensive player, to the point where the team had no choice but to keep him. He was a 5’9” cornerback [that had little production in the CFL](http://www.firstcoastnews.com/sports/nfl/jacksonville-jaguars/after-two-years-in-canada-jaguars-cb-johnson-trying-to-make-the-most-of-his-nfl-second-chance/288445127), and he somehow finds his way onto the roster after making play after play in the preseason. So far in 2017, [he’s looked promising](http://www.firstcoastnews.com/sports/nfl/jacksonville-jaguars/josh-johnson-showing-improvement-while-jaguars-starting-cornerbacks-deal-with-injuries/449701303); granted, it’s been without pads, but it’s still a positive sign. He also made, quite possibly, [the best defensive play of the season for the team last year](https://youtu.be/j66Vg__hElk?t=2m49s) with his lone pass breakup of the season against the Colts (although why Andrew Luck didn’t run the ball there, I’m not sure; I’m just glad we won that game because if we didn’t, I would’ve come close to killing my non-football fan roommate… but that’s another story for another day).

His spot on the roster looks good, but you never know. It’s not safe yet, and I’m going to take him off of the bubble (because it’s tough to lock a guy on the roster who barely played once Aaron Colvin came back), but it’s looking promising for him. Jalen Myrick was the seventh round pick that the Jaguars chose this year out of Minnesota, who is lightning fast but is still pretty raw as a cornerback and not polished. At the very least, he’ll find a spot on the practice squad, although in all likelihood, I could see him making the roster as a possible gunner (because that’s a great use for his 4.29 speed).

The wild card in all of this is Taurean Nixon, who was claimed off of waivers almost immediately by the Jaguars after the Broncos cut him earlier in the offseason. The Broncos have a pretty deep secondary, so naturally, some good players are going to fall through the cracks. If a cornerback gets cut from the Broncos, they deserve more consideration than if they get cut from the Ottawa RedBlacks. Seeing as [the move to release Nixon was a surprise](http://www.denverpost.com/2017/06/14/broncos-waive-taurean-nixon-sign-chris-lewis-harris-in-cornerback-swap/), as he supposedly had an impressive offseason and even intercepted Paxton Lynch for a touchdown, this could be that sneaky pickup by the Jaguars that somehow makes it onto the roster. He’s 6’0”, and Myrick and Johnson are significantly under 6 feet (they’re both 5’9”), so it might help if the Jaguars keep on another tall cornerback.

If I had to make a prediction, Josh Johnson and Taurean Nixon make it onto the roster, with Jalen Myrick going unclaimed and making it onto the practice squad. It really comes down to Nixon against Myrick. Do the Jaguars choose the big, physical cornerback, or the small, raw cornerback with incredible speed?

**S: James Sample vs. Jarrod Wilson**

The two starting safeties are going to be Tashaun Gipson at free safety and Barry Church at strong safety. I’m expecting Peyton Thompson to make the roster as one of the backup safeties, simply because I’m not impressed by anyone else coming for the backup free safety job. Unless Charlie Miller can surprise everyone and actually look good, Thompson will make the roster, barring a waiver claim when final cuts are made. The other safety to make it (since the Jaguars will keep four safeties, and I’d be very surprised if it was any other number) is a bit trickier.

On one hand, you’ve got James Sample, the fourth round pick out of Louisville from 2015. He just can’t stay healthy. In two seasons, he’s only played four games. He suffered a [forearm injury in 2015](https://www.bigcatcountry.com/2015/6/9/8750583/jacksonville-jaguars-daily-rookie-james-sample-to-miss-10-12-weeks) that he tried to play through, but ended up getting placed on IR midway through the season, and in 2016, [he was placed on IR with a shoulder injury](http://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/jaguars-james-sample-placed-on-ir/). Basically, he’s barely seen the field. He can’t stay healthy. He was born with glass bones and paper skin, and [every afternoon, he breaks his arms](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lbp87aNhe51qbh3dno1_500.png). I can’t even say he’s looked good when he’s healthy, because he’s barely played. His sample size is not very big, pun absolutely intended.

On the other hand, you’ve got Jarrod Wilson. He didn’t exactly look impressive, but the UDFA out of Michigan managed to play all 16 games, so that has to count for something. If you’re an UDFA and you stay on the roster for all 16 games without bouncing down to the practice squad, that’s pretty good. I can’t recall anything specific that he did, but he was there.

Let’s assume that James Sample can stay healthy. Let’s assume that he’s actually able to compete for a spot on the roster this year instead of riding the injured reserve. Who wins the battle? This could be a real toss-up. If everyone stays healthy, then Sample probably wins and gets a legitimate chance to prove himself, with Wilson winding up on the practice squad if he doesn’t get claimed. But in actuality, I’m expecting Wilson to win the battle by default because Sample suffers another injury. I just can’t trust the man to stay healthy.

He shouldn't done it but it probably wouldn't have happened if Norman had been penalized before it got out of hand. Odell has been the target of tons of contact and out of bound hits in order to rattle him and it pisses him off when those defenders get away with it.

He lacked the guy who could get open for him within 5 yards and this had Tony making some questionable throws downfield which here and there lead directly to a loss.  

I think he had some good enough D's, I think he was missing a complimenting WR to his game and not having that guy forced Tony's hand.

I read somewhere a few years ago that only 8 teams in the NBA broke even or turned a profit. 

In 2015 the NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, addressed the media saying [""a significant number of teams are losing money every year""](https://clutchpoints.com/adam-silver-nba-teams-are-losing-money/).

&gt;""I don't know the precise number and don't want to get into it, but a significant number of teams are continuing to lose money and they continue to lose money because their expenses exceed their revenue.""

**Forbes 2015**

&gt;The five most profitable NBA teams made an average $37 million over the last five seasons, and eight teams made over $15 million last year. 

That's the 5 *best* in the league. 

&gt;The league's most profitable team is the Chicago Bulls, who have a five-year average profit of $55 million.

However, last season, 2016, the NY Knicks...

&gt;""...turned an NBA-record operating profit of $141 million last season."" 

That's the NBA's *record*.

**Forbes 2016**

For comparison, as of 2016, the [Dallas Cowboys Revenue was $700 million](https://www.forbes.com/teams/dallas-cowboys/), and operating profit was $300 million. [The Pats showed a revenue of $523 million](https://www.forbes.com/teams/new-england-patriots/), and operating profit of $212 million. 

In 2017, the [average NBA franchise is worth $1.37 Billion](https://www.forbes.com/nba-valuations/#3e081e116db6), whereas the *lowest* franchise in the NFL in 2016 was the [Buffalo Bills at $1.5 Billion](http://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2016/09/14/forbes-nfl-valuations-detroit-lions/90361894/).

**QB- Jameis Winston:** Jameis Winston exceeded expectations in his first two years, becoming the first player in NFL history to throw 4,000+ yards in his first two seasons. It hasn’t been without significant issues with turnovers, however. In 2016, Winston had the 2nd highest number of interceptions among active QB’s, with 18 picks (6 lost fumbles in addition), completing the ball to the defense in 11/16 games (four of which were multi-pick games). It didn’t help that Winston was limited by a sheer lack of weapons, narrow WR depth, and an offensive line who didn’t do him many favors. A lot of these roster deficiencies were addressed this offseason in signing D-Jax,  drafting Howard, and drafting Godwin. As his rapport continues to develop with his existing targets in Evans, Humphries, and Brate, I’m expecting a big leap in year three for him. *Probably Wrong Projected Stats: 4,353 yards, 61.3% completion percentage, 32 TD’s, 14 INT’s* ",nfl

this is what he tried to do in the big game against one of the best dynasties in football history and it but him in the ass. he got slack ass on his play calling and kept putting our defense back on the field more than they were used to, something the patriots will take advantage of.

of course the field goal doesn't guarantee a win, but 3 knees in a row after the julio catch would have took a hell of a lot of time off the clock, and make it a two possession game. this is all of course because kyle hit the breaks like he did in every regular season game.  ",nfl

14845,"I disagree that he has been good. 

People act like we can't fairly evaluate Bradford because his teams haven't been good, but I simply disagree. We are able to evaluate QB's independent of the teams around them. The fact that Bradford has never led a team to a winning record, in 7 years, makes me think he is a below average qb. And judging by the fact that he refused to compete against a rookie QB for his job in Philly, I think he also knows he's a below average QB.

People here like to yell ""OH MAN THE VIKINGS OLINE WAS SO BAD! TJ CLEMMINGSSSSSS!"" There's a lot of truth to this. But there are also teams that had even worse offensive lines, and their QB's (Rivers, Luck, Wilson) outperformed Bradford. Why?

No doubt it's a one in a million type of shot to make it to the NFL and it's a hell of an accomplishment but if you are drafted you should be set for at least a decade if you aren't irresponsible.

",nfl
18658,"This narrative is patently false.

Brady took bottom-5 defenses to the AFCCG three years in a row (and the SB once).

Brady has also faced *much* stiffer competition in the playoffs, while Manning annually padded his stats by crushing WC opponents. Brady has also won the AFCCG more than Manning has been to it (Brady is 7-3 while Manning is 4-1; so Brady has won the SB as often as Manning has won the divisional round). Getting to rack up a ton of WC games and get knocked out of the playoffs early most years pads your playoff stats. 

Sure Brady wasn't super human *every single game* but that isn't realistic to expect. You also pointed out the Ravens and Texans, who both have exceptional defenses; Manning never played the Texans and sucked against the post-season Ravens as well. 

Also, Brady wasn't exceptional in the one Colts game, but he murders them almost every time they meet so not sure what you're outlier is supposed to prove. The Chargers games he played poorly, but not terribly; he put together a 9-minute drive to seal the victory in one, and in the other he led two 4Q scoring drives to take the lead and seal the win.

He has 7 more playoff games than Manning, yet has 6 more games with &gt;100 passer rating (12 to Peyton's 6). If Manning did play those 7 extra games, he would need 23 TDs but only 5 INTs to match Brady's numbers. The INTs he could probably do, but that's at least 3 TDs every game, a feat he only accomplished in 6 of his 27 playoff games (2 WC, 3 Div, 1 AFCCG).

Plus let's not forget that half of Peyton's two rings come from being literally dragged by an all-time great defense. Brady may have had more years with a top defense, but he never had a defense like Peyton did in 2015. Similarly, Manning had five top-10 defenses that he couldn't get to the AFCCG. Brady had one.

Lastly, stats like ""Manning was 2-3 when his D gave up 30 or more points"" are intentionally misleading.

QB|Year|Opp.|Score
:|:|:|:
Manning|2002|Jets|0-41
Manning|2009|Saints|17-31
Manning|2014|Seahawks|8-43
Manning|2013|Ravens|35-38
Manning|2007|Patriots|38-34
Manning|2003|Chiefs|38-31
Brady|2009|Ravens|14-33
Brady|2007|Colts|34-38
Brady|2014|Ravens|35-31

So first of all, Peyton is 2-4 and 3 of the losses were blowouts where he couldn't do shit on offense. This comparison also ""double counts"" the Pats-Colts game in which Peyton just *barely* outscored Brady.

Brady is also 2-0 in the Super Bowl when his team gives up 28 or more points; Manning is 0-2.

Manning has led his offense to 20 or fewer points fourteen times in the playoffs (fifteen, actually -- 7 of the 24 SBL points came from Von Miller); Brady has done this only ten times -- despite playing 7 more games.",nfl

And for those CEO's of an actual eSports organization it's massive advertising and the ability to ensure your place in the future.  We could potentially see the San Francisco NRG 50 years from now.

You really can't blame me for accepting the results of an official and independent investigation. Keep in mind that they have a bad track record from Spygate too.

There will be very few people that argue that Brady had better weapons 2007 - 2015. 2013 Brady lost Welker and Hernandez, Amendola got hurt, Gronk went down, and they will went to the AFCCG. Imagine if Manning lost his top receiver, his 3rd receiver, and then midseason lost his number 1 and 2 receiving options.

Brady has gone from Spread to 2TE to 3WR to losing receivers year in and year out, and he is routinely the QB of a top 3 offense.

20530,"I bet you they follow the raiders next. Season 1 I'm not 100% why they followed the Cardinals. Maybe because they were expected to do decent and it's a good underdog story.  But, as a Cardinals fan I can tell you it brought a LOT of new football fans. Our sub was flooded with people from all over the world asking questions about how the NFL worked and jumping on the bandwagon. (I'm sure they fell right back off after last year though) people that aren't even football fans loved the show because of how it digs into the emotional stories and investments these players make.

  I think they picked the Rams for season 2 for this purpose. They were trying to suck in new fans in LA. To me, season 2 sucked in comparison (of course I might be a little bias). I mean, ilthe editing was amazing, but season 1 had a team that was hot. They were rolling and climaxed with one of the best playoff games in NFL history. Then followed by a huge let down in the NFCCG. You see all the emotion crash and burn, it hits even a non fan right in the feels. 

  But the Rams had none of that. There was no climax, the whole season was... Meh... It was still awesome as a football fan to see under the hood of an NFL team, but it didn't bring in any new fans. It may have gave existing fans hope but it bored everyone else.

Yes, Steelers D is all about attacking and taking risks *except* when it comes to pass coverage.  Troy bucks that trend, and it's the only reason he's acceptable in the secondary - he makes up for mistakes with more interceptions.  I'd rather the Steelers D always go for the throat and give up the big play on occasion, especially now that the offense isn't completely inept.  Also, I see Harrison and Woodley dropping into coverage very often.  I think that's a mistake in general.  They do it too often to surprise anyone, and it's never a sprint out to the flat that would wreck a bubble screen nicely. I'd rather see them take out the NT on passing downs and pin their ears back and rush 4 + 1.  Let Timmons and Polamalu play the LB's in coverage.

21042,"#Random Non-Buccaneers Thoughts

Here are ten random non-Buccaneer thoughts.  

1.	Andy Dalton will a darkhorse MVP candidate. Mariota too. 

2.	When Brett Hundley came out of college, I had a 1st round grade on him. I stand by that assessment and believes he’s a great QB lying in wait. On the subject of backups, I think at some point this year the Bills may take a look at Cardale Jones and may be pleasantly surprised.


3.	Jared Goff is going to be a great QB in this league. Fans, especially those on r/NFL have been quick to write him off. He’ll benefit with the addition of McVay. Speaking of 2016 picks, don’t dismiss Laquon Treadwell yet. Despite the poor rookie season, I think he’ll turn it around). 

4.	Patrick Mahomes ends up the best QB from the 2017 class and will become the next gunslinger in the vein of Favre/Stafford/Cutler. 


5.	Browns are going to finally escape bottom dweller status. That offense is going to be better than you think it is, and they have just enough pieces on defense now that they’re going to pester a lot of teams. I think they have a 5-11 floor and a 9-7 ceiling, but they’ll be competitive in every game. 

6.	The AFC Championship Game will feature the Titans and the Patriots. The NFC Championship Game will feature the Packers and the Giants. You know where I’m going with this. 


7.	Demarcus Ware is retired now, and with his retirement, you’re about to be introduced to Shane Ray, who may be in the running for DPOY this year. 

8.	If Kenneth Dixon stays healthy and gets more touches, he’s going to be a beast in Baltimore. 


9.	This is Tom Brady’s final season. But actually. 

10.	The hottest seats in football belong to Todd Bowles, Chuck Pagano, and Jim Caldwell. With the (stupid) firing of Dave Gettleman, you can now add Riverboat Ron to the hotseat too. Because Jed York is an idiot, Kyle Shanahan can also be considered a hotseat candidate. 

#Grading the Writer: Revisiting the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of my 2016 Predictions. 

Here's a link to the [2016 predictions post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/4nq9ay/offseason_review_series_tampa_bay_buccaneers/) I reference below. 

*The Good*

**Projecting Jameis Winston's Stat Line: ""Projected Stats: 4,324 yards, 60.4% completion rate, 28 TDs, 16 INTs.""** Actual stat line: 4,090 yards, 60.8% completion rate 28 TD's, 18 INTs

**Projecting Mike Evans' Stat Line: Projected stats: 87 receptions, 1,328 yards, 11 TDs.""** Actual Stat Line: 96 catches, 1,321 yards, 12 TD's

**""With ASJ’s piss poor attitude and immaturity, I think Brate will take the starting TE role...The possibility of Cameron Brate supplanting him [ASJ] as starting TE is strong, and I wouldn’t be surprised if ASJ is gone by season’s start. I think Brate comes out on top here, with ASJ possibly being traded.""** Well, that dick head got cut. 

**On Donovan Smith: ""Donavan Smith had an extremely tough job last year, stepping into the LT spot as a rookie and having to protect the blind side of a rookie. Smith looked slow, lost, and seemed to get penalties at the worst times...The jury is still very much out on Smith, but I was hoping to see more flash. r/Buccaneers is pretty high on him. I’m not.""** Smith finished 2016 with a PFF grade of 42.0 overall, good for the 69th ranked tackle. The step forward we were hoping to see in year two did not happen. 

**On Verner vs. Banks: ""I think one of these guys winds up off the roster, and I think it will be Banks.""**

**On our projected season record: ""Last year [2015], I projected we would go 7-9. We wound up 6-10 so I wasn’t terribly off...we’re going to go 10-6 this year [2016]""** Off by one game the last two years. But was pretty close on this one. 

**On Lavonte David: ""We saw the best of Lavonte David when Bill Sheridan allowed him to have more free reign in blitzing and dropping into coverage...We’re excited for Mike Smith’s scheme, as it will give the opportunity to capitalize on Lavonte’s underrated strength as a pass rusher. I think he’ll return to top form this year.""** Sure enough, Smith's scheme let David return to All-Pro form (which hopefully the AP will recognize). He was all over the field and looked like he was back to top form as a pass rusher. 

**On JR Sweezy: ""...but in Sweezy, we overpaid for a guy who most Seahawks fans would say was a huge liability for them. PFF rated Sweezy the 66th overall guard with a 46.0 grade. Not exactly awe-inspiring.""** Sweezy never saw the field due to injury, which allowed Pamphile and Benenoch to learn by fire and test their readiness. Both had their pains, but the Sweezy signing was pretty bad, injury or not. 

*The Meh*

**On Brent Grimes: ""We paid the right price, and while I don’t see him returning to top tier form, he’ll certainly be less of a liability than Mike Jenkins or Tim Jennings were last season.""** Grimes actually looked like he was back to top tier form this season, and despite tearing his Achilles and being on the wrong side of 30, he looked even better this year than with the Dolphins in 2015. A great acquisition at a great price. 

**""On Marpet: ""Want a bold prediction here? Marpet will get All-Pro this year. Mark my words.""** All-Pro teams haven't been named yet, but from an NFC perspective, Marpet is going to have trouble getting named this season. Regardless, he took a huge step forward, and has arguably become the best lineman we have. He's nowhere near his ceiling yet. 
*The Ugly*
**""I’ve been a fan of this game long enough to see that poor behavior in college is usually a predictor of poor behavior in the NFL...Though Spence sent a month’s worth of clean drug tests to all 32 teams, I remain suspicious of his ability to stay clean.""** In reality, Spence has been a valuable asset to our team as a rookie, and he really came into his own later on in the season. Knock on wood, but he seems well removed from his checkered past and prior transgressions from college. He is going to be a valuable building block for our future. 

**On Chris Conte: ""When the Bucs signed Chris Conte last year, there was a collective rage amongst our fanbase. Conte proved us wrong and became one of the most reliable cogs in our otherwise porous secondary. I can’t imagine this was a large deal, but it’s an important one.""** Conte played solidly for us in 2015, but 2016 was a huge step back for him. His performance against the Raiders was one of the worst games I've ever seen from a safety, and he'll likely be gone in 2017. 

**On Kenny Bell: ""The hype machine around Kenny bell has been huge on r/Buccaneers, and with his return, we’re hoping he provides a speedy and sure handed target for Jameis. Projected Stats: 51 catches, 740 yards, 7 TDs. I dunno, this is probably a bullish and wildly off prediction. He may not even make the roster.""** Those projected stats? Quite off. Bell didn't make the final roster. 

**On Roberto Aguayo as a 2nd rounder: ""What he does bring us though, is almost absolute reliability with extra points, short to medium range field goals...""** Aguayo brought us none of that, and his lack of reliability made games more stressful than they should have been, at times. He will need to take a big step forward, starting with the preseason or risk losing his job to competition.

#Wrap-Up

If you’ve read my previous Buccaneer posts here, you’ll notice that they’re often full of self-deprecation, a reflection of the state our franchise has been in since our Super Bowl victory. The ineptitude of our past is no more. We have a capable and promising quarterback we’re prepared to lean on, an innovative coaching staff, and enough pieces on both sides of the ball that we will compete in 2017. 

Despite the pieces in place, I still consider this a developmental year and am not expecting a well-oiled machine that takes us deep into the playoffs—at least, not yet. As David Mamet said, ""Old age and treachery will always beat youth and exuberance."" At the start of last season, the Buccaneers had one of the youngest rosters in football. The oldest? The Atlanta Falcons (who blew a 25-point lead in the Super Bowl, by the way). There’s something to be said about “old age and treachery” in this league, and the Buccaneers don’t have those grizzled veterans yet. In time, we will. 

What we lack in experience, we make up for in a locker room with more passion for football than we’ve had in a decade, as well as high energy guys who have helped shake our losing culture in the same way the John Lynches, Derrick Brooks types, and Ronde Barbers of the past did. 

Tune into Hard Knocks this year. You’re going to see the start of a very special couple of years for us. It’s about damn time.

Didn't he get himself suspended for a game in 2015? Or what happened in the Vikings game last year when he had almost as many fouls called as catches?

I love what Beckham has brought to this team but lets not pretend for a second that it hasn't affected his play at all. And even if it hasn't, it's still a pain in the ass that the team doesn't want to deal with - they don't want to deal with the media questions and the circus that surrounds it. As he gets older, if this becomes a repeated pattern, teams are going to go after him from a mental standpoint. Beckham can't concede that mental edge.

I think a lot of the drama that surrounds him is blown out of proportion (eg not showing up for OTAs) but nevertheless, he needs to understand that he plays in a market where your life is going to get placed under a microscope regardless of what you do, and it only gets more intensified the better of a player you are. He doesn't need to be a choir boy like Eli or Jeter but he does need to just go meh whatever and let it go. He doesn't do that - custom cleats, tweets at the ""haters,"" and so on.

Bottom line, he can catch 10 balls for 120 yards and 2 TDs in a game, but if we're driving for a game winning field goal and he commits a stupid foul that pushes us out of FG range, that negates everything else he did in the game.

They play totally differently within their systems. If you have a Deep Cover 3 like Seattle does, Earls side to side ability is inherently more beneficial. But put him on, say, the Bears and you lose Earls playmaking because teams can just pick on the guys underneath him. 

Berry is more plug and play. He can fit into any system in the NFL and succeed. He's a jack of all trades but also a master of few. He's better at man coverage and in the box run defender. He could step onto 32 of 32 defenses and instantly make them better regardless of scheme. He's made Pro Bowls in different systems under different coaches. 

KC has let corners go each year because they know EB can make up for their failures. Seattle has, for the most part, kept a consistent core. That's not a knock on Earl, just showing the versatility of EB. They'd likely have the same number of All Pro teams if EB didn't get hit by Stevie Johnson or the cancer.",nfl

The commissioner's powers are derived from the CBA, which was agreed to by the players through their union.  It's a contract.  The courts can't do anything to change that contract, the change will have to be made in the next CBA.

As to what your employer could do if you were investigated for a crime, that depends on what state you're in and what your contract with them (if you have a contract with them) says they're allowed to do in such a situation.  If you're in Texas, you're in a right to work state meaning an employer could easily punish or even fire you for being accused of a crime as long as you're an at-will employee (most employees in Texas are) and you wouldn't be able to do anything about it in court.

your second list doesn't have last year included and lists the Steelers dynasty Brady had to overcome in it.

Again, describe how Montana had tougher competition?

Based on....  what?

When Montana had to face the Giants, they made the playoffs 6 years and missed it 4 years (with 3 losing records).

The Colts made it 10 years and missed the playoffs once (and had one losing record).

How were the Giants 'more well rounded'?  They both made 2 SBs and the giants won 2 and the colts one (giants winning one by 1 point after a missed FG). 

Actually provide some level of logic/stats/analysis instead of just saying they were.

Thinking that he had scored a touchdown for the Vikings, Marshall then threw the ball away in celebration. The ball landed out of bounds, resulting in a safety for the 49ers.

A bit off topic, but still kind of relevant as an analogy, I'm a HS teacher myself and there's a reason there's such a low teacher retention rate, especially at poorer schools. A lot of well intentioned (and often pretty good) teachers volunteer to work for lower performing schools thinking that they can make a difference. Many of them soon find out that having an awesome lesson on Newton's Laws won't engage a student if they barely got any sleep or food the previous night and got high before class (assuming they decided to go to class at all). Not to mention how the administrations at those schools will often limit anything creative or innovative a teacher might try to do. There's only so much one person can do against systemic issues.

Definitely a lot, but with Eli probably being done in two or three years it won't completely crush your cap. You may have to let one of your shiny defensive toys go at some point, but it wouldn't be the end of the world.",nfl
29667,"Hell I wouldn't call his behavior bad at all. He has been a model employee of a terrible organization for a decade. He just asked for a trade, didn't bad mouth the owner or the team, just asked for a trade because he said he wasn't having fun anymore. Nobody would characterize that as bad behavior. ",nfl

I would like a Charles Johnson or even if we could get Ray Edwards away from the Eagles siren call. I would also like to get Jonathan Joseph, maybe even over Nnamdi, because of the price tag. You won't hear me complain if we get Nnamdi, though. If anything, I would be jumping up and down in pure joy. We should also grab a good #2 wideout, like Malcolm Floyd, but there is a big part of me that wants Randy Moss. Everyone has this predetermined notion that Randy will be a cancer in the locker room, but I think that Freeman can keep him happy by slinging the ball around between him and Mike Williams. I would also like us to look at another RT. I guess Trueblood is out and Charles Lee is a RFA. ",nfl

I think ypc and ypg are better stats especially when looking at prime seasons.  Emmitt only averaged over 5 yards a carry once, Sanders did it for half of his career. Emmitt was a great back but because we tend to talk about potential goats and not the top 5 or 6 he rarely gets mentioned.

I also think the single most important rushing stat is single season rushing, followed by career yards per game and then career yards per carry. After those volume rushing and scoring come in to play ",nfl

This is actually a topic I love to talk about. I spent the last four years working with men getting out of prison. A large portion of which was spent getting guys jobs where they were treated and compensated fairly. It was a tough but rewarding gig. My point was to simply say that if a depth receiver had committed Vick's crime, and served his sentence, he almost certainly would not have gotten a job afterwards. Vick ONLY got that opportunity because he was at one point in time a transcendent player. 

I think you're making a few hiccups. First, all crimes are not viewed equally. For whatever reason people are more apt to hire a theft or drug offender rather than a murder offender. This in spite of the statistics OVERWHELMINGLY showing that people with chargers of murder 1 are the best parolees and have the most successful lives after prison. It's unfortunate but in our current climate (it's probably getting worse honestly) it is what it is. Second, do not fool yourself into thinking the american criminal justice system is rehabilitative. It is strictly punitive. Any rehabilitation that happens is fought for tooth and nail by social workers who are under staffed, under resourced and under paid. ",nfl

Teams regularly get to or win Super Bowls without Star RBs. Heck the only star RB who's team has won a SB in the last 5 or 6 years is Beast Mode. Tons of star QBs make it to the Super Bowl with meh running attacks, but it almost never happens the other way around. ",nfl

Which is understandable as Whitehead had already ""lied by omission"" about several other things that he was required to report to the team.

I love Favre and Young, but in my humble opinion, talent-wise he was head and shoulders above Young, and shoulder-to-shoulder with Favre.

You don't want to leave him 1 on 1 with a D end like you could with somebody like Gronk maybe, but he is pretty solid at it.

He would eat homemade catsup, prepared with honey. He did consume beef but not the kind injected with hormones. He ate only unprocessed dairy products. He teethed on frozen kidney. When Todd was one month old, Marv was already working on his son's physical conditioning. He stretched his hamstrings. Pushups were next. Marv invented a game in which Todd would try to lift a medicine ball onto a kitchen counter. Marv also put him on a balance beam. Both activities grew easier when Todd learned to walk.

But it's no different than what Harrison did in his prime and quite honestly is a huge reason concussions came into light in the past ten years. Questionable low hits, may I ask what in the hell that means? You can blame the NFL for low hits. That's the way the game is played now. Knocking over camera men? 

Vontaze Burfict is the villian the NFL and media wants. He makes crushing hits and sometimes goes a little too far. But nobody mentions how great of a linebacker he really is and quite honestly he reminds me of Harrison on the field. I enjoy watching Burficts intensity and I definitely do not condone some of his hits. But what really pisses me off about ESPN, NFL.com and fans on this subreddit is the unnecessary bullshit he gets for being a 'punk' or a 'criminal' is absolutely ubsurd. Go ahead, look it up. He's never been arrested for anything and is a gentleman off the field but because all everyone does is watch ESPN they get spoon fed an unbelievable amount of crap about him. 

If Burfict played for the Steelers he would be considered an all time great. If he played in the 80s, he would be a HOFer by the end of his career. But sadly because of the Bengals bad group of players from '00-'09, this is the persona they get which is not fair. I'm used to it by now - lol! ",nfl

Edit:  Haven't been able to reply since I've been on the road.

To clarify, technically we have a limit on how much alcohol we can expense, but there are certain ways around it.  One is to take a local colleague lower than you on the totem pole out and expense it that way.  It's actually policy for me to pay and drinking allowed ;) (also entertainment allows for a much higher per diem).

The other way, if you're traveling in a non-English country is to have one person expense dinner for 2-3 people and the others buy the drinks.  If you work it right, and you're not ordering easily translatable drinks you're fine.  Bonus points if you're in a country like Romania where drinking is super cheap.  I never ate and drank so much as when I was there and only paid my hotel tab out of pocket (which was around $30).

I'm optimistic about that happening but, as always, people cling to recency bias. If you had just watched the last few games of the regular season then 11 quarters of the postseason you'd think we're in position for a top 10 defense but the sample size is what scares me. Granted we have a very very young defense so maybe we were seeing them come into what will be their level of play. Who knows though, football's fucked. 

Back to your question though, I absolutely think we see a drop in points scored but as long as the defense is middle of the road and the offense is as good about not turning the ball over then I feel good about where we're at. ",nfl

There is a clear hierarchy in the world for American Football players. The best players in the world play in the NFL, if they can't succeed there they might play CFL or somewhere else (generally of course, some might choose CFL or arena for other reasons).

Rugby union has professional competitions in several countries (with Super Rugby and Aviva Premiership being the two most competitive). Same but less so with Rugby league (NRL and Super League). Rugby sevens 'professional' pinnacle is the international circuit, these are the teams which generally play at the Olympics. Rugby sevens is generally not what a 'rugby player' aims for from the outset and to Rugby supporters generally, 7s is a 'side event' to the professional 15 a side leagues and world cups (although the inclusion in the Olympics will change that over the next few Olympic cycles).

37838,"#Projected Starting Lineup and Camp Battles - Defensive Edition  
  
##Starting Lineup - Defense  
  
**DE – Brandon Graham, Chris Long (?):** Really, the only player at this position that is a lock to start is Brandon Graham. The 2016 2nd team All-Pro is the personification of “sacks don’t mean everything.” Per PFF and Football Outsiders, Graham finished [second](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2017/defense-and-pass-pressure-2016) in the league in pressures. Sure, sacks are important, but so is the ability to alter what the offense is doing. However, I will admit, Graham needs to find a way to up the sack totals. Regardless, Graham was outstanding in 2016 and could have a repeat performance.   
  
After BG, the starting spot gets murky – although murky is a bit misleading. As the roster currently stands, there is no sure fire starter opposite Graham. The Eagles signed Chris Long to replace Connor Barwin. Long is a better fit for the defense and should be a good rotational piece. Vinny Curry is looking to have a better season after disappointing fans throughout last season. Curry had 2.5 sacks in 2016 as a rotational rusher and never seemed to earn the complete trust of the coaching staff. It is possible that Curry was injured for part of the year given a minor injury he suffered last preseason, but he wasn’t close to the explosive rusher he was in previous years, which is what makes his 2016 season so aggravating. Curry was always miscast in Chip Kelly’s defensive philosophy. The excitement for what he could do under Schwartz was high given how he fit that mold. Schwartz was backing Curry in one of his offseason press conferences, saying that Curry did get a lot of pressure but still had some consistency issues. Maybe it is coach speak, since I didn’t see what they saw. Regardless, Curry can’t be moved this year, so the Eagles have to hope Curry bounces back a bit.  
  
I already wrote about what Derek Barnett brings to the Eagles in another section, but it’s worth repeating that he should see significant snaps as a rookie for the Eagles. One positive to our current depth chart is Barnett won’t be forced to carry a heavy load, but he will see work as he improves. He excels as a pass rusher and as a run defender, the latter of which Curry doesn’t. If Barnett is able to develop a secondary inside counter rush move, he could see even more playing time.  
  
BG, Curry, Long, and Barnett are locks to make the roster. The Eagles may choose to keep 1 or 2 more players and have 3 players competing for those spots. The first is 2017 7th round pick Alex McCalister, who spent 2016 on “IR” serving what was basically a red-shirt year. McCalister is tall defensive end, at 6’6” but was significantly undersized at 239 pounds at the combine last year. Last month, McCalister weighed in at 251 pounds. In addition to the weight, McCalister needed to get stronger in order to compete in the NFL. I don’t know what to expect from him this summer but it feels like the coaching staff loves him and he has every opportunity to win a spot. Steven Means is the next man up competing for a spot. Means earned a spot on the roster last summer after having a terrific preseason. He even played in a few games last year.  Means doesn’t have a ton of upside as an edge rusher but could be solid in a rotational role. One thing I love about Means is his competitiveness. When he is on the field, you can see him bust his ass every play.   
  
After Means, comes Marcus Smith. The 2014 1st round pick has done nothing but disappoint in his 3 seasons with the team. Although MSWho has improved each year, those improvements have been incremental. Instead of becoming a quality player, he sucks *just a little bit less.* At this point, MSBoo is dead weight and likely to be cut prior to the start of camp. Smith missed all of the voluntary OTA periods due to them being “voluntary.” Yes, I agree, it was voluntary, so he didn’t have to show up. That’s fine, I get it. But let’s cut the BS for one second: everyone knows that a 1st round bust has no business having this approach if he wants to keep his job, which he probably doesn’t. And that’s fine, I understand the need for a fresh start, but it’s not like he did much to impress future employers. The Eagles can save about $1.5 million against the cap if they cut MSShoo by the 3rd day of camp. I would be shocked if they didn’t do it. He is dead weight and a reminder of a failed regime. Just do it already.  
  
I’m not sure how many rushers the Eagles plan on keeping, but I think a logical guess would be 5. Of the 3 mentioned above, I think Means has the best shot of making the team. He is a special team’s contributor and is further along as a DE than McCalister is – at least from what we have on tape. McCalister has much higher upside than Means and could play his way onto the roster this summer, but Means is the safer pick based on what we know about their abilities. Either way, the spot comes down to one of these two.
  
**DT – Fletcher Cox, Timmy Jernigan:** [COX](https://twitter.com/fduffy3/status/798251631997546496)  
  
The Eagles made the correct decision letting Bennie Logan walk earlier in free agency. While every fan, and likely every coach, loved Bennie, I believe the team needed to find an upgrade to him and not commit more money than they should along the defensive line. It was a difficult challenge for the Eagles considering cap concerns, but they were able to pull it off when trading for Timmy Jernigan. Jernigan [has more sacks in fewer games and starts while being 3 years younger](https://twitter.com/BrandonGowton/status/849343061989699584) than Logan. Jernigan played in a system in Baltimore that didn’t have him attack as much as he will here. [He can get after the QB](https://twitter.com/BrandonGowton/status/849347979421110273). He’s also [relentless and strong](https://twitter.com/BaldyNFL/status/849343312477786113). One downside to Jernigan is he is on the last year of his rookie deal. I would think the Eagles would try to re-sign him but it’ll be difficult considering the number of rich contracts along the defensive line already. We’ll see, but he’ll be starting alongside Cox.  
  
A lot has been said about Cox throughout the season, ranging from the typical mouth breathers questioning if he is playing hard enough, to Cox actually taking over games. As you would expect, Cox was excellent in 2016. Even though Cox had a few more penalties than normal, good players play aggressive. [Here are 8 plays against the Packers where Cox makes an impact](https://twitter.com/fduffy3/status/803989699966730241). According to Fran Duffy, against Green Bay, [Cox was blocked with a single player on 3 of Rodgers 27 pass attempts](https://twitter.com/fduffy3/status/804004689297739776). He is a [monster](http://giant.gfycat.com/OrganicShorttermDarwinsfox.gif) on the interior, but there wasn’t enough help around him on a consistent basis outside of Graham. Logan was a fine player for the Eagles but Jernigan simply offers more. Barwin was everyone’s favorite, but Long offers more. Barnett is as good a pass rushing prospect you will find. But damn, [I could watch Cox all day long](https://twitter.com/fduffy3/status/793537901661417473).  
  
There is more around Cox now. After the top 2 guys, the Eagles will keep Beau Allen, who may start the year on PUP after surgery to fix his torn titty. The Eagles kept UDFA Destiny Vaeao last year and may do so again, but there is more competition along the interior line this year. Gabe Wright was a late addition for the Eagles, who was cut from the Lions. He has the opportunity to earn a spot as a rotational rusher. Rookie Elijah Qualls is an intriguing prospect who could sneak a spot on the roster too. The starters are set but those reserves are not. Not the deepest position group on the team, but there are plenty of solid options to help out on the line.

38358,"&gt;Yeah, but you adjusted them in a way that doesn't account for the fact that overall level of talent in the NFL has increased and become more consistent. When people pointed out that you should use standard deviation instead, you just said ""yeah I thought about that but i don't think it'll make a difference."" Well guess what bud? It does make a difference. PFF's advanced passing stats are adjusted for era using standard deviation, and their stats look a lot different than the adjusted stats that you produced. According to PFF's advanced passing metrics, which are a lot more reliable than yours, Brady and Montana's stats are almost exactly even with maybe a slight edge to Brady.

Hahaha, you're purposefully misconstruing my points now, what the fuck, you're actually just lying.  Thats pathetic.  I compared the all-time great QBs of both eras as an example that the greats were still just as dominant back then.  And if you want a better example, Manning actually beats Montana using a lot of era-adjusted stats, why is Brady unable to do so?  And please link me to PFF's era adjusted stats because a cursory search didnt return anything for me.

&gt;When you finally admitted that AV was completely useless in the way you were trying to use it, you started using RAW RECEIVING stats to conclude that Brady's weapons were better instead of adjusting them to make them comparable across eras. Of course Brady's receivers are going to have better stats, the era that they play in has a MUCH HIGHER volume of passing, so there's more yards and touchdowns to go around. And if you adjusted Rice, Moss, and Gronk's stats for era, you would see that Rice is a lot better than both of them combined compared to that era. Which was funny because you made that statement yourself in a different thread. You change your argument depending on if you want Montana to be the greatest of all time, or if you want Rice to be the greatest of all time. No consistency what so ever.

You're actually lying right now, again.  Literally, fucking quote where I just used raw receiving stats to compare them, please, Im begging you, because I didnt, and you're just making shit up because anyone who's a Pats fan, or even someone who believes Brady is the GOAT is more likely to believe you than others.  I compared Rice to Moss/Gronk as all-time great talents, and I put Welker over Clark due to a higher amount of individual accolades and being a revolutionary at his position.  And thats funny, its something that a lot of Pats fans fail to see when they make idiotic arguments for Moss being definitely better than Rice in his prime, but drop when it hurts Brady.  I agree that Rice was better, but Brady had Moss/Gronk for more games.  And lol, I have been consistent saying Rice was better, if you're just comparing primes tho, Ive been consistent in saying Rice was only slightly better.

I did mention Roger Craig, so once again you choose to ignore what I said, and **directly lie for a 3rd time** when I mentioned Montana had a clear advantage at RB.

&gt;You ignored my point about adjusting recievers stats to era instead of looking at raw stats. You ignored my point about standard deviation. You ignored my point about using magnitude to compare the amount of games Moss and Gronk played with Brady, and the amount of games that Rice played with Montana instead of just using aggregate games. You also ignored my point about Rice putting up much much better stats than Gronk and Moss combined. And you also ignored other people's points about including Craig who was a very significant player in the 49ers offense during Montana's time, and about adjusting defensive rankings for a 32 team league because during the 49ers era the league only had 30 teams.

I never looked at raw stats, so that's false.  I countered standard deviation by showing that there wasnt that much of a difference in QBs then anyways.  What do you mean by magnitude, do you mean percentage of games played with? I responded by saying Edelman was still a greater factor than any other non Rice/Clark receiver.  And I fucking included Craig lol, stop lying repeatedly throughout the post.

&gt;No dude, you just put out a very poor and biased analysis and got all butt hurt when people pointed it out. It's as simple as that.

Nope, you chose to lie about what I said to make me look bad which is about as low as you can go.

The gretzky era was part of the golden age of the ""goon"" (a low skill player who was on the ice to hit the other team at any opportunity, protect their own teammates, and throw down the gloves to fight when necessary)

Dave Semenko was Gretzkys goon for alot of his career, including most of his days with the Oilers.  They were almost always on the ice together.  If someone tried to hurt Gretzky, or even if they laid a big, clean hit on him, you can bet Semenko is gonna be punching you in the face for it.  

So basically yes, high skill hockey players get messed with all the time and Gretzky was absolutely no different..  But especially during that era, if you are laying the big hit, you BETTER be ready to defend yourself. 

ALSO, If you are doing things against the rules to hurt or slow down Gretzky, you are gonna get yourself a penalty and find your team down a man in a 5v4 for 2 minutes versus the greatest scorer of all time.  Not a situation you want to put your team in. ",nfl

My point is that QB Wins aren't *really* a thing. Rings are a **team accomplishment** and that in the actual metrics which we can compare, Aaron is so far ahead of the pack, Brady included, that the Rings argument shouldn't have any bearing and that such an argument really should only be given weight when the comparable metrics between two players is close.

I don't care about the downvotes, I obviously do believe that my stance is correct (otherwise why would I ascribe to it?) but I could be convinced otherwise, but I don't believe that there is actually any data that points to a contrary position outside of ""QB Wins"" and ""Rings"" which is of course the metrics which I am saying are not so useful in such a debate.

Take your pick of Young, Marino, Stabler, Fouts, Kelly, Rodgers, Bradshaw, Tarkenton, Tittle, or Luckman. And I'm probably missing a few.

I grant the CBA fucks players over but I am glad the Pat's didn't give a massive extension when they can get Butler for either 1 year 3.6 m or (if they franchise him) 2 years and (3.6 + franchise number...).

Position | Player | Old Team
--- | --- | ---
FB | Tommy Bohanon |
WR | Larry Pinkard |
TE | Mychal Rivera | Oakland Raiders
OL | Branden Albert* | Miami Dolphins
OL | Earl Watford | Arizona Cardinals
OL | Demetrius Rhaney | Los Angeles Rams

**Tommy Bohanon:** To emphasize the fact that the Jaguars were bringing back the fullback, they signed Tommy Bohanon in free agency, who was the starting fullback on the Jets from 2013-15. This was before the team drafted Marquez Williams in the seventh round, so Bohanon was a signing just in case they couldn’t get their guy in the draft at this position. On one hand, Bohanon was not on a team last year, so his odds of making the roster don’t look that good when you think of it that way (especially since there’s a seventh round pick on the roster that’s going to be the likely starter). On the other hand, the only reason he wasn’t on the Jets last year was because the Jets did not carry a fullback. It’s not like he lost the starting job; they just took the job away. In 2015, he was the starting fullback when Chris Ivory led the AFC in rushing, so Bohanon definitely had a part in his success. I don’t think he ends up making the roster, but it won’t be because of poor play; it’ll be because you’re only carrying one fullback, and Williams has to be the favorite at this point.

**Larry Pinkard:** Of all the receivers that are currently on the 90-man roster (and there are 12 of them), the one with the least chance of actually getting signed and making it onto the 53-man roster has to be Larry Pinkard. He wasn’t on any team last year, and hopped on and off Green Bay’s practice squad in 2015 before signing with Oakland that same season. The thing about Pinkard is that, judging from the box scores, he’s a big play receiver. Of the catches he had in the preseason back in 2015 when he was on Green Bay’s roster, his worst catch in terms of yardage was 8 yards. A lot of his catches go for big gains, upwards of 30 yards, including [this 77-yard touchdown pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6ZLUKE6ulo) in week 4 of the 2015 preseason against the Saints “defense.” However, judging from the box scores, he seems like an inconsistent receiver; in the final 2 preseason games with the Packers, he only caught 3 of the 9 passes thrown his way. Considering the fact that Green Bay’s backup quarterback that was throwing the passes is actually a quarterback (Brett Hundley) and not some guy that’s just making up the numbers, that’s a bit concerning. Pinkard might be good for a big play in the fourth quarter of the preseason here and there, but I doubt he’s anything more than that.

**Mychal Rivera:** With Julius Thomas now on the Miami Dolphins, the Jaguars desperately needed a new starting tight end. They can't ride into the season with Marcedes Lewis, who is entering his 12th year and is on his last legs at this point, as the top guy. The Jaguars found the answer to this problem by signing tight end Mychal Rivera in free agency to a 2-year deal. Is he going to be the guy that solves the void at tight end? Probably not. He's 6'3"", so he's not exactly a true tight end in terms of his frame; he's built a lot like Clay Harbor, but better. However, he can be used in the passing game, as he had 58 receptions back in 2014. The two things on his side are his ability to stay healthy and his ability to catch the ball (which seems like the opposite of Julius Thomas). He caught 72% of passes thrown his way last season, and he's played 61 out of a possible 64 games in 4 seasons. While he's probably not the long-term answer at tight end, and might not even be a real #1 tight end, he's better than anything else the Jags could've brought out for 2017.

**Branden Albert:** I’m putting Albert here because I couldn’t put him anywhere else, since he was technically acquired in a trade where the Jaguars gave up their seventh round selection in the 2018 NFL Draft. The obvious pro with Albert is that when he’s healthy, he’s really good. In 2015, he made the Pro Bowl with the Miami Dolphins, and he did the same in 2013 with the Kansas City Chiefs. There’s no denying that Albert can play in this league. However, you don’t get a player by giving up a seventh round pick if they don’t come with some problems as well. The two obvious problems with Albert are his age and his injury history. Even though Albert is entering his 10th year in the NFL, he’s going to be 33 years old by the end of the season. Bleacher Report had an article [about the prime age of an offensive lineman](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1683775-when-does-age-catch-up-to-nfl-players), and what they concluded was that offensive linemen typically start declining around year 11 or 12. But seeing as Albert was a 24-year old rookie (and most rookies are around the age of 22), he’s technically entering that year 12 range (since a rookie who is 33 years old that enters the league as a 22-year old player will be hitting year 12 by the time they are 33). The other obvious concern is his injury history. I’ll bring this stat up a lot at various points in this write-up, but in 9 seasons, he’s only started a full season once, and that was in 2011, when there was practically no offseason. Every year that he’s gone through a full offseason, he didn’t start the entire season. He’s only started more than 12 games once in the last 5 years, and that was in 2015, when he started 14 games. Out of 80 possible starts in the last 5 years, Albert has started just 58 games, meaning that he’s missed 22 starts (about a season and a half worth of starts). Obviously, that’s not good. It’s likely that Albert is nothing more than a very good stopgap before Cam Robinson takes over the left tackle spot.

**Earl Watford:** The Jaguars signed Watford for what should be nothing more than offensive line depth on the interior (since left guard was a revolving door last season, with guys underperforming and getting hurt left and right). In terms of depth, he’s not a bad guy to have; he’s played multiple positions on the line with the Cardinals (guard and tackle), and he started 11 games for the Cardinals last year. I think [this review](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/5yt9ak/former_cardinals_g_earl_watford_will_sign_with/desqdtc/?st=j4swfkle&amp;sh=3c9990f4) by /u/SenorSpicyCat when the move was announced pretty much sums up what Watford can do. Good depth, especially in run situations. He should make the roster, and might even win a starting job when all is said and done.

**Demetrius Rhaney:** The Rams released this man on June 20, and the Jaguars claimed him on June 21, so he’s only been on the roster for a few weeks now. The former seventh round pick out of Tennessee State was on the Rams for three years, and since he is entering his fourth year, he does not have practice squad eligibility. If he’s going to play for the Jaguars this year, he’ll have to find some way to climb up the depth chart and make the 53-man roster. Rhaney played all 32 games over the past 2 seasons, and even got a start in 2015. [His background story is pretty interesting](https://sports.yahoo.com/news/missing-high-school-transcript-nearly-derailed-shot-at-college-and-nfl-for-offensive-lineman-demetrius-rhaney-183421633-nfl.html), and how different his life almost was due to a missing high school transcript. I’m guessing he’s not that good and was just playing because nobody else on that offensive line could; unlike the reaction when Watford signed with the Jaguars, [everyone on the Rams subreddit seemed happy that he was gone](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngelesRams/comments/6ifeg0/rams_have_released_centerguard_demetrius_rhaney/?st=j4swkr8k&amp;sh=bd741816). Guessing he won’t be anything more than a camp body in what seems to be a crowded interior line competition.

His run stop percentage was 27th among 4-3 DEs (low end starter), and his pass rush productivity was 39th (decent 3rd stringer).  He only started 6 games last year, and only played 58.3% of snaps for the Panthers, giving him the added benefit of coming onto the playfield rested, and still not being starter level in the mainly efficiency based stats I just mentioned.

48161,"I think Caldwell is a better coach than he was in Indy. His scheme of using the offense to run out the clock last year was the *only* reason we were able to make the playoffs. We had massive, gaping holes in the roster and he used the best scheme possible for that roster. The scheme didn't always work, and it wasn't the most entertaining football to watch, but it got us farther than a *lot* of people were saying (ESPN was saying 4-12 to 6-10 at best without Calvin Johnson) it would.

That said, his clock management is still horrible and he wanted to keep Lombardi. So he's far from being the perfect coach. But, the man has been to two Super Bowls (not as a HC, but on the coaching staff), so he's been involved with winning organizations before. He also is reportedly very much on the same page with Bob Quinn, so it helps when the HC and GM work well together.

I think there's a ceiling with Caldwell, but I don't really know what that is. We've only had three seasons with him, and only one under our current GM. I don't think at this point the ceiling is much higher than a playoff win. But, Caldwell has also given us a floor. Gym Shorts got us to the playoffs once but every other season he coached us was a bust. Caldwell's gotten us there 2 out of 3 years, and we haven't done worse than a 7-win season (and even then only because of Lombardi's shit offense). He's not afraid to piss off the fans if it gives him a strategic advantage. Like when he pulled Peyton Manning and ruined the Colts' perfect season. The fans hated it, but there is no trophy, no award for having a perfect season in the NFL. There is only the Conference Championships and the Super Bowl. Resting Peyton was the smart call.",nfl

He had a shitty first draft, but that's not unexpected when he was trying to overhaul the  entire scouting system (see BB's first draft, where we drafted a bunch of slugs ahead of Tom Brady). He got a 1st back for Trent Richardson, and got picks for 2014, but then got canned before using them.

I see the turnover in Cleveland with the FO and coaching staff and that all points to terrible ownership. Lombardi certainly isn't perfect, but I don't think he's the root cause of your issues. That award goes to Jimmy Has-scam.",nfl
50046,"&gt;Umm, correct me if I'm wrong, if he got from #1 to #10... he's still a top 10 TE.

In the context of Brady v Ryan, the fact that he dropped from the #1 graded TE to #10 means that Brady only really got to play with a top a 15th or so graded guy in that time frame. 

&gt;And that's not how these grades work, by that logic you could add a bunch of mediocre WRs and they'd be more help than Julio Jones.

By definition, mediocre or average players would not contribute positive grades. Julio graded higher above mean than Sanu, Gabriel, and Hooper did combined anyway. The limited total number of offensive snaps prevents insane scenarios like this from happening. 

&gt;Gabriel had a higher passer rating when being thrown at because Matt Ryan was throwing to him lol, this is like when Tyler Lockett and Jermaine Kearse had high passer ratings when targeted last year because Russell Wilson was throwing to him.

You realize Edelman had Brady throwing to him too, right? We're comparing receivers of consensus top 3 QBs last year. The difference between their passer ratings and completion percentages was much less than that of those specific receivers when targeted.

&gt;Yeah, and Gabriel was extremely effective because the entire defense was too busy trying to figure out how to guard Julio fucking Jones when Matt Ryan was having a historical QB season while throwing to him.

WR grades are intended to be independent of QB play. Getting open on a route and not getting thrown to gives the same exact grade, unless the receiver recovers from a poor throw or makes a contested difficult catch. Gabriel still got open on his own like few other receivers in the nfl did. He might have done it against #2s, but that would just make him far and away the best #2 in the nfl when he played.

&gt;And no, another argument against receivers who take limited snaps, they have time to rest and perform at higher energy than the defenders. That doesn't make them better at all than the players who don't produce at as high of a rate on a per snap count, but still produce higher overall. That's like saying Frank Clark or Danielle Hunter are better pass rushers than Von Miller or Khalil Mack because they had higher sacks/pressures per snap, and that's not even an exaggeration, that's a literal comparison to what you're saying right now.

At this point I believe you don't understand why I use cumulative raw grades over the pff grades. Those well rested rotational players don't break the scale of cumulative grades because of their low snap counts. Having a +1.0 play from Julio or any other WR is just the same from the QBs perspective, and Ryan had an insane number of great WR plays last season. Neither Clark nor hunter came close to Miller or Mack's defensive contribution by this same grading system, so that comparison is just bogus.

&gt;Lol nice job not including Amendola's rank in the BR 1000, he was the 30th best receiver, which is an elite #2 option, and Hogan at 68 is a great #3 option.

Didn't we already disregard the BR1000 article? First of all, they aren't even measuring offensive contribution. They're measuring WRs based on 5 attributes and simply adding them together. That kind of sloppy math is far worse than say the difference between OPS and WRC+. This didn't even attempt to value the overall offensive contribution of each player in 2016, and that's what we're discussing. The fact that you call a sub-250 yard receiver in Amendola an **elite #2 option** is comical when stats and other film review completely reject that.

&gt;Umm, 16 Brady wasn't able to because he wasn't as good as 16 Ryan, but I guess that point is useless to use here. Can you give me information on 13 Manning and 11 Rodgers and 11 Brees, which imo are the only seasons in this decade better than Ryan's?

Manning team passing grade (-QB) was +35.7 in '13. '11 Brees' +30.6. Rodgers' '11 was +21.1  Ryans was *+58.1*. There's the difference and it's exactly why Ryan wasn't graded as having a a historic QB season by PFF. 

&gt;No, pff film review absolutely does not agree with Gabriel being 3rd, fucking lol, they graded him as the 21st best WR. 

Again, please understand that they scale grades so that extremely efficient receivers who play below a qualifying number of snaps don't top the player grade chart. It is a fact that Gabriel would have ranked #3 had he kept up pace for 800+ snaps. And again, whether he would have kept that pace or not is irrelevant. He still provided ryan with a half season of extremely productive WR play, and in this context, that's significant. 

&gt;And BR Top 1000, which does the best job out of the 3 of separating WR from QB play (PFF looks at whether the WR made a good play or not, but a lot of times, a great play by a WR will be diminished by a QB not seeing him on a read, or not throwing him open, which diminishes the opportunity for a WR to make a great play), and BR drops Gabriel a lot, showing the effect Matt Ryan had on him.

1, this isn't how PFF grades. They grade every route whether the receiver is thrown to or not. BR1000 doesn't do the best job of anything especially when it doesn't even attempt to valuate total offensive contribution and uses 5 traits added together like a 5th grader trying his hand at making a new statistic. 

&gt; And jesus christ, any person who actually watches film or grades receivers would tell you you're crazy if you call Taylor Gabriel an elite receiver.

Well I doubt either of us actually reviewed every one of his snaps in all-22 and graded each one last year like PFF did, so I'm gonna have to side with them. Neither I nor PFF would call Gabriel an elite receiver (in the sense that people are hesitant to crown an ""elite receiver"" after half a season), but, based on last season alone, in the snaps he did play, he absolutely played like a solid #1 playing against 2s. 

&gt;And more evidence pointing this way, Gabriel wasn't even close to this good until he played with Ryan.

He still managed to win routes on his own outside of QB play. It's not all that unrealistic for an undrafted FA to break out right after leaving a poorly coached Browns team. His routes were clearly much smoother this year than any year prior and Ryan had nothing to do with that. ",nfl

His speed was the most notable, but he couldn't change direction or react to cuts and got pushed around by basically every receiver he faced. In the end with us, he was basically so slow that he couldn't cover anything more than 5-15 yards down the field. Like at all, he'd be beat by several yards 15 yards down the field even with a cushion. 

Furthermore, all of the sudden he couldn't play. Most notably the physical side of football. Dude wouldn't tackle, like at all. Him and DRC would literally let people run right past them without giving a flying fuck. But it wasn't just that, he couldn't cover anymore, even if he had managed to stick to the WR, he wouldn't turn around to look for the ball, he wouldn't use his arms/hands to deflect the pass and he made wrong reads all the time. 

Misused, yeah, but people seem to have this thing about him only playing man. We literally played him both man and zone, press and off, used short and used deep. We did everything. While it didn't help that he was asked to do a different thin like every other month because of shitty scheme/staff, people ignore that he was equally bad at everything we asked him to do. It wasn't just scheme, he was done. 

He was also kinda not there mentally, which is super weird because when you listen to him talk you could obviously hear that he was a really good dude and super smart. He really was a guy you could root for, but at the same time there was these kind of weird moments, the most notably that he didn't eat with his teammates, but would go out to his car and eat alone, yet a lot of players spoke of him as a leader and a mentor.

If you remember, Archie Manning was campaigning against the Chargers quite openly. And distastefully. Then Peyton joined in. And Eli sort of sheepishly went along with it.

The problem for San Diego isn't that the Manning family argued against San Diego, the problem is that they *told the truth about the organisation*, which is that it's not a very good one. The Mannings extracted a pound of flesh from AJ Smith and the Spanos family. If they were going to have their prodigal son drafted, the Mannings were going to air all of the Chargers dirty laundry.

Do the Chargers fans care? No. Because they don't believe there's anything wrong. But you know who does care? Other players and their agents. Other teams and their GMs. You don't talk about the problems of other teams openly when you're a Manning. But they did. And they didn't damage the reputation of the Chargers - they did it on their own; they confirmed to other people in the NFL that it's not a team worth doing business with.

The fans think whatever they think of the Chargers. Good payroll, seem to be there, blah blah. But the people in the league were empowered to stand up to the Chargers. You saw Vincent Jackson do it. Marcus McNeill did it. Acrimony. It's not a nice destination for free agents if there's a reputation of having to deal with bullshit. The team has been forcing the city to give it handouts for decades now and threatening to move. The team, under the past 3 GMs, the latter two who are totally different than Bobby Beathard have had problems attracting free agents and retaining players.

55554,"I draw the distinction a little differently, FO uses statistics in really unique and intellegent ways to make statements and predictions, but at the end of the day their math comes from the box score - I go to them for interesting analysis, not unique statistics.

PFF collects a lot of really unique data that nobody else does - but their analysis is shit.  If I had the $200/yr subscription I'd go to them for the really in depth stats and things they generated themselves, but the public articles and grades mean nothing to me.

I agree they are trying to fill totally different niche's.  FO is better for the ""intense fan"", and PFF is better for the front office/analytical guy who is willing to shell out the money for their premium stats.  

What I will say is you don't need FO to get to the truth, PFF's propriatary stats are enough if you can do the analysis yourself.  FO is better for the people who aren't paid to crunch football #s though, since they do a good job getting to conclusions that make sense using a transparent methodology.",nfl

To come so close to something your franchise has never tasted and then to have it all turn to ash is brutal. The Patriots (and Boston) had already had incredible recent success and multiple championships. 

Sure, a perfect season would have been a nice crown jewel, but really that's like complaining that your cheeseburger doesn't have bacon on it while there's a man starving on the street corner who's hoping for any bite of food. 

The Patriots are champions. Tom Brady and the Pats, every fan in Boston, they've all experienced multiple championships.

No I live here in the real world where we know that a contract with no guaranteed money means nothing for a player and they have no negotiating power.

He could have asked for his release which the team would have certainly granted him. He could have said I will not play for less etc. He didn't, he negotiated with the team all the way up until they realized they could not make a fair agreement and they cut him.

It is not the teams responsibility to pay someone more than they are worth just because the two sides are negotiating. You are acting as if Harris was asking to be released and the Jets refused. Also don't put words in my mouth to try and make your crappy argument. I didn't say he was asking for more money. I said he was asking to be overpaid. Than he went and signed for less that 50 cents on the dollar somewhere else.

He than went and signed somewhere else for the money the Jets were offering him. As I said that is fine but don't cry that the Jets screwed you because they didn't overpay you.

&gt;There is absolutely no reason Harris should have reworked that contract and took whatever change the Jets threw at him. He's still a good player. He was picked up by the best team in the league and paid more than the Jets were offering to pay him. That alone shows he had no reason to bend a knee and kiss the proverbial ring of the Jets.

Stop making things up. I don't care if he wanted to leave, that is fine. What I said is don't cry that the team screwed you over and act like they tossed you aside. 

The Jets made him a fair offer, he refused. He than took that same offer somewhere else. As I said that is fine but don't cry about it. He could have stayed if he wanted.

That is the other bullshit thing about what you are saying. You are acting as if the Jets were lowballing him when you paid him the same thing the Jets were offering him. Yet somehow the Jets offer was screwing him and the Pats offer was a fair deal?

For a few years, my town was the summer training camp for the Rams (during the ""Greatest Show on Turf"" era), so for a couple of weeks, the town would be invaded by large men in Cadillac Escalades (seriously...they were everywhere).

My other one is that I went to college with former Chargers Punter Mike Scifres. Not like ""sometimes see him around campus"", but we were the same major around the same time, so we had a couple of higher-level broadcasting classes together (classes with like 10-12 students tops).

Most guys play to win games as well as for the salary they get paid to do so. They love football. Albert strikes me as the type who views it as a job, not a passion... A job where he already got paid huge portion of his pay in advance with no penalty for not working hard from here on out....

Since I watch ESPN Amercia in the Netherlands on cable, I get all the commercials and studio talks from the horses mouth, figuratively. At the same time these are on, my friend in the UK gets a different experience: 

Since my friend watched last years playoffs on Channel 5 UK, channel 5 filtered over the commercial breaks with their own and their own half time show, this in my opinion is understandable for a commercial channel in the UK, but it was damn irritating for him. My friend gets to watch the actual Superbowl on the BBC though, which means it gets a similar treatment but I believe all commercials are cut completely since BBC1 is commercial-free. 

On a side note, Channel 5 couldn't afford to license the games after the playoffs so thats why we had to switch to watching together via makeshift DVDs. 

All in all we aren't too bothered by the commercial breaks. It gives us a chance to take a toilet break and talk a bit more casually about other things we have interests in (i.e gaming, zombies etc). 

Since we moved to watching DVD-based games the commercials and halftime shows are cut out completely in order to fit the games onto the DVD without too much downscaling to fit. More recently (as of this week) I've managed to help my friend get a USB stick solution which he downloads the games off of me directly so no more lossy DVD and postage costs :)

That being said though, that 2006 game where we got nearly 400 yards rushing against you guys made it all mostly worth it, especially since you guys ended up winning the SB that year.

I don't know how true that is because I can't watch the film, but that makes sense.

Regardless, my greater point is that y'all did not have the talent to make the super bowl/win it. According to football outsiders, offense is more important than defense. It's an offensive league. That's why every single team in the championship was a top tier offense led by a top QB. In the divisional round, only two teams had a bad offense, and they both lost. 

Almost every single year, the super bowl winning team is one led by a top offense. At least in recent years. Even if you
look at winning teams known for their defense (Seahawks, Ravens), their offense was still quite good. Wilson with lynch, flaccos super bowl win was one of the best QB playoff performances statistically, and they scored tons of points. The Broncos had one of the best defenses in history, and they are the only
Super bowl winning team in recent memory to win despite their offense, and even then, manning was still leading them. 

Year in and year out, top defenses with average to below average offenses make the playoffs, then lose in later rounds. Chiefs, Texans, etc, it's almost always that way because offense just has more value. ",nfl

In the past, Musgrave has worked a lot with run oriented teams, and since we're a West Coast Offense, we're the opposite of that. JDR thought that Downing matched our offense better and Downing looked very promising as a QB coach. It's rumored that some teams were interested in Downing as a coordinator, so he has the skills to do it. He has built rapport with Carr and JDR, and they trust each other more than Musgrave.

7m for an elite CB is pretty small. I know I'd take any of this year's top corners for 7 mil because Gilmore is at 8.5 in his first year, and he's obviously not as good as Revis was at that point.

Now your OL will prevent anything catastrophic, but they both played at such a high level last year that any regression could cause them to drop 1-2 games that would make a difference.",nfl
69179,Gronk backs it up by consistently being the best to ever play his position when he's on the field... Of course he gets a pass.,nfl
69219,Darren Sproles is currently number 8 in career all purpose yards. Ahead of LT Barry Sanders and Hershel Walker.,nfl
69227,"Perfect example, if we're doing career Fitz is a tier 1, if we're doing potential future (2017 and beyond) hes not lol",nfl
69242,~~He has said~~ It has been reported several times that he may not coach again after this year for health reasons. Nice username btw ,nfl
69257,Reminder that this is about analysis so any and all politics are strictly not allowed.,nfl
69274,As someone whose team has been continually ass raped by Fitz I don't see how he has an argument over Marvin Harrison for 4 and it's debatable between him and cris carter for 5.,nfl
69287,I remember that game. It was my first year playing fantasy football and  Brees was my QB. Got so many points from him that game.,nfl
69289,That doesn't tell the whole story though. Aside from the 14-2 2006 team the chargers consistently underachieved given the talent they had.,nfl
69302,"People tend to think the duo of Brown and Bryant is overrated, duo to Bryant missing a bunch of games. 

I'm sure Bryant is going to give defenses nightmares this season.  His unique change of direction ability and burst combined with his size and top end speed is phenomenal. ",nfl
69363,"Probably should factor in how much better CBs/S position is and the fact they play much more of these packages nowadays with less running threat.  

For instance check out how often teams play all out pass defense on us. ",nfl
69373,"Uh what, no, downtown SC and the beaches are *much* more crowded during tourist season than during the school year. The only difference is that Mission backs up *way* worse during the school year since the tourists rarely come out to west side. I generally avoided that road as much as possible, which wasn't much, unfortunately.

I lived there for three years, it was a great place. Within two blocks of the beach for two years, and then up toward 17 for the last year. ",nfl
69433,"Eh Wentz made it on there,  he had a mediocre at best season overall. Then Gurley who had a shitshow of a sophomore year.  ",nfl
69448,"Not really considering the Steelers rarely go out in free agency, and the team is really young.  By the time his contract will become an issue, Ben's dead cap will be off the books. . Besides he's not over paid, he's being paid his worth. ",nfl
69501,"Well yeah, that's what I'm saying. Levy hasn't ever exhibited a willingness to do that though, so it'll be interesting to see what happens over the next fews seasons, especially with the new stadium, as you mentioned. 

Can't see Kane going to either Arsenal or Liverpool, think if he moves it'll be United, City, or maybe Madrid. ",nfl
69510,"Beal is impossible to measure until he plays. He has terrible skills but somehow always dominated the guy across from him. As far as Von Miller over Dareus... risky pick. The DT's are thin and it isn't a deep FA class. But Von Miller is a freak. Nate Soldier (1st round pick) was asked if he was having trouble blocking Miller in the Senior bowl. Soldier said he was having problems touching him. 

As far as the BayBay pick, I like it. He has a history with injury, but when he does play, he will be awesome. Tebow... right guy, wrong round. ",nfl
69522,"I really don't understand the pro players sentiment around here.  I guess it's because they're the ""little guys"" in this fight.  Both sides has contributed to this mess, but anyone who has followed this closely should be able to plainly see that the players have caused the most trouble.",nfl
69531,ohh boy this sub turns into a madhouse when this topic comes up. Can we just enjoy 2 legends ,nfl
69644,"I would take Ryan for a full season or game myself, Drew's age just worries me, he put up some stinkers towards the end of last season, particularly against my team, and our defense was nothing great last year. For what it is worth (which isn't much) he was very underwhelming in the Pro-Bowl, something that is set up in every possible way to help out the QB's put on a decent show, the cracks are showing with Drew Brees, people just aren't talking about it.

Or I can have a reigning MVP.",nfl
69689,I watched a bit of that flag football thing a couple weeks ago.  They asked Ocho if he was going to be tweeting during the game and he said he would not because he hadn't paid his phone bill.  Then I was sad.,nfl
69715,Not sure what leagues let you draft offensive linemen lol,nfl
69775,That he is. Sad to say he probably would've been nice if there was a camera on him. ,nfl
69800,I was thinking of attending but I had work and also I'm a scrawny pusspuss.,nfl
69810,Damn. I spent all this time training just to be discredited by a stranger on the internet. Suicide time...,nfl
69839,Some people threw Jadaveon Clowney's name around in high school. But even he needed to bulk up.,nfl
69876,"I will be sad if Ben retires.  The Steelers are my 2nd favorite team; I spent a lot of time in your beautiful city.  I really believe the Patriots killed Schaub when he came to town the #1 seed in 2012, and that we killed Rivers' best shots at rings in 06 and 07.  With the way Ben ended last season talking about how he felt like the Patriot's little brother and no matter what they do it's just not good enough I feel like we're destroying every QB from the class of 2004 except the one that matters!",nfl
69907,They should draft Tim Tebow's shoulder for Matt Stafford to use. ,nfl
69908,I think this guy is on to something and I don't like it one bit.,nfl
69944,"Chuckle. Seeing a Green Bay fan so hilariously defensive is adorable. Do you think anyone here reads your ""hurr Stafford is average!"" nonsense and is convinced?",nfl
69947,Not exactly fanbase but my favorite thing about r/eagles are the insanely detailed game day posts. Top tier content.,nfl
69956,"I wish I could tag you on the Narwahl Reddit app as ""Lime Guy""",nfl
69986,Everyone at my school called me an idiot for wanting the Hawks to win that game,nfl
