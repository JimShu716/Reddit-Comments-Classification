4606,"&gt;i know many people in their 20s and 30s that just won't do it.

This is such a pet peeve of mine when the older generations complain of Americans choosing not to marry or have children.  It's so myopic that no one is even considering the incentives upon incentives in our society **against having children** and getting married until well in your 30s, if you are lucky.

Let's start with the college debt that cannot be dismissed with bankruptcy.  More and more people are graduating 21-26 with hundreds of thousands in student loans.  They literally have monthly payments totaling a mortgage payment. So instead of purchasing a home together, more and more are doing the responsible thing and living with their parents or renting with multiple other people in the same situation. Not a good time to get married or have kids.

Then we have a poor economy with poor entry-level job prospects and no federal parental job protections. So the only job you can get is part time and you need it to, you know, eat and pay them student loans, but if you happen to get pregnant, you will definitely need to be out to be all lazy and lay on your back to give birth.  You may find yourself without a job to go back to and with an extra tiny mouth to feed. Not a good time to get married or have kids.

But that's okay because then we get to the lack of any federal program to provide assistance with early child care.  That's right. Even if your state has job protections for you to generously stay home with your newborn 6-12 weeks post partum, what happens after that? Child care is hella expensive. You or the baby daddy needs to make sure your tiny helpless child won't die while you try to earn enough to eat, and pay those student loans, oh and those medical bills. So one of you is going to be unemployed, and if you're breastfeeding and have said breasts, that's probably the only body part that will be working for the time being if you choose to have a child.  And that goes until pre-school or kindergarten with no public opinion to help with child care.  Not a good time to get married or have kids.

Oh, and our precarious health care situation! Let's not forget that! Even currently, under the ACA/Obamacare, not all insurance policies are created equal. Some carry huge deductibles that are back breakers all by themselves (in addition to the large, mandatory monthly fees that are the largest complaint against the ACA). And with the new bill, why, maternity might not even be covered if your state doesn't feel like it!  Not a good time to get married or have kids.

So many ""pro family"" advocacy groups are focused on abortion only or bemoaning how much fewer people in their 20s and 30s are getting married and having children for lack of Jesus when it's really just a matter of responsibility.  Of course the result of planning for children well into the late 30s and 40s are fertility problems and other complications.

TL;dr:  When these people say ""kids are too expensive,"" they are not just talking about the cost of diapers or missing out on European vacations.  They are talking about massive career and financial setbacks cause by our current economic circumstances and a lack of legislative incentives that promote families.",worldnews

The judges are preventing the parents from causing their child more pain and suffering due to their delusions. There is *no* chance the kid gets better from this treatment because they already have severe, irreversible brain damage.

It should *exactly* be the place of a judge to tell the parents no, that's the whole purpose of having judges looking out for the best interest of the child. There's no ""small"" chance, there's ""no"" chance and the parents' will to make their child suffer for no possible chance at recovery.

&gt; BEIJING - With flybys of advanced new jets and a mass rally of troops, Chinese President Xi Jinping oversaw a large-scale military parade at a remote northern China base on Sunday to mark 90 years since the founding of the People&amp;#039;s Liberation Army.

&gt; Traveling down a long strip lined with tanks, missile launchers and other military vehicles, Xi, wearing military fatigues, greeted thousands of troops.

&gt; Sources with ties to the military say Xi&amp;#039;s announcement to cut 300,000 troops, made at a massive military parade through central Beijing in 2015 to mark 70 years since the end of World War Two, has caused unease within the ranks.

I'm not advocating that having more kids = better, I'm saying that its not as simple as more kids = forever poor. I'm saying that the situations and ideals in the first world don't always translate to the poor of the third world. 

Depending on how far apart you have your kids, then they can share clothing, or have hand-me-downs, or share toys. Plus in a situation where only the well off and richer can get an education, education does become very important. These kids will more than likely value education, knowing that its the only way for them to be able to provide for their families. 

Also, while I agree that getting an education is the best way for them to improve their situation, I don't agree that by dropping out of school they'll end up hardly working or making much money. In a city like that, craftsmen and vocational opportunities are more plentiful than in the US ( i'm using the US as my point of reference, I'm not assuming you're necessarily from the US). It is possible to make a decent living being a craftsman. 

I'm not saying that this lady having 8 kids is going to make their situation better, on the contrary, I think less kids would probably have made life a little easier for them. My point is that its not as simple as that.

&gt;What makes a nation third world? 
Despite everevolving definitions, the concept of the third world serves to identify countries that suffer from high infant mortality, low economic development, high levels of poverty, low utilization of natural resources, and heavy dependence on industrialized nations. These are the developing and technologically less advanced nations of Asia, Africa, Oceania, and Latin America. Third world nations tend to have economies dependent on the developed countries and are generally characterized as poor with unstable governments and having high rates of population growth, illiteracy, and disease. A key factor is the lack of a middle class—with impoverished millions in a vast lower economic class and a very small elite upper class controlling the country’s wealth and resources. Most third world nations also have a very large foreign debt

Never said it was, it's just not under discussion at the moment. 

&gt; Telling someone they can't wear something is the same as telling someone they can't wear anything as far as I am concerned

Well, then you are wrong. Forcing someone to do something is quite different from telling people they cannot *choose* do it. It's all about letting them exercise free choice. Both are forms of human rights but they are still different things. 

&gt; Wearing a veil provides absolutely no protection against crashes. 

It offers ""protection"" against prying eyes for those who feel that way. Who are you to determine the value/validity of that belief? 

&gt; you shouldn't conceal your face any more than is legally required for safety purposes; blowtorches etc.

Why? Who are you to tell me what I can and cannot do? If I want to walk down the high street in a spiderman costume (hiding even more than a burka) then why should the government say I cannot? 

Governments exist to manage our taxes, provide public services and promote the international interests of nations. They are not our rulers.  

&gt; My grandmother never used to cover her hair? 

She sure as hell did. Try and find a pre-WW2 picture of her hatless in a public street. Those who did not wear hat's were called ""hairies"", the insult is still used in Scotland today to describe ""crazy women"". Originally it meant either ""poor"", ""uncivilised"" or ""unkempt"". A muslim woman in a conservative middle east country today would get the exact same response as was once common in the UK. 

Shit, people used to attack you in the USA for wearing a straw hat past a culturally observed date, there were gangs of people roaming around the cities looking for those who did not conform. I think I recall reading the same happening to those who ""wore white past labour day"".

I suspect if you knew more of this sad history then you would be less enthusiastic about your position on legislating clothing. 


&gt; I've never heard of women being culturally inclined to hide their faces. 

That's not the point; if you are going to hate something, at least try to understand it. It's about being ""modest"", some people just take it WAY too far. It's not about ""hiding"" anything, consider an opposite force to those who wear makeup to make themselves stand out. 

&gt; I would bow as is culturally customary. Seems entirely nonsensical to move to another part of the world with an entirely different culture and still maintain a different one. 

That's pretty much a short summary of UK history, particularly the colonial times. Our place in the world was to go to those cultures, burn down all of their temples, steal all of their artifacts then to rebuild the nation in our own image. And you are upset about a Muslim chick wearing a cloth in the UK? For real? 

&gt; From say CCTV you could identify my face? 

There is no law saying that you need to be visible on CCTV. Otherwise hoodies and baseball caps would have been banned long ago. And that's the elephant in the room; these groups cause infinitely more destruction. Where are the people making your points about them?

A nation in NK's position doesn't survive this long by being stupid and not having a plan. The only way for them to survive is to make a military attack on them more consequential than it's worth.

So NK starts developing nukes, the only thing capable of making the US think twice. It puts them in US cross hairs, but Saddam didn't develop nukes and look what it got him. Nukes are the only way to ensure the long term survival of the nation.

You've also got to make it absolutely clear that you're crazy and have your nukes on a hair trigger. You see posessing nukes doesn't make you untouchable; MAD is weak to a technique called 'slicing'. This is where one nation makes very small aggressive moves; a tiny slice of territory here, funding insurgents there, none of which warrant a nuclear response on their own but add up over time. So you make people think you'll launch a nuke at the slightest provocation.

So why doesn't the US sweep in before they've developed ICBMs? Because it would rightly cost them pretty much all of their influence in the area. Because a second Korea war would be immensely damaging to South Korea and surrounding nations, and this war with all its woe would be be undeniably undertaken for the sole benefit of preventing America, and only America, from ever being under any real threat. In response to such a blatantly self serving war, from China to Australia the US would be diplomatically shut out from the region, denying them the opportunity to tranquilise the rise of Asia and ensure continued US hegemony in the future.

13590,"&gt; a textbook example as to why we have the electoral colleg

You're *very* confused.

The purpose of the electoral college was a compromise between *just* the Congress appointing a President and *just* the population voting one in. Congress essentially agreed to it on the specific idea that the EC would *stop* populist Presidents from being elected.

With that, you have a situation where a distinct *minority* of voters have *INFLATED* vote value. Not all votes are equal, period. A rural voter in Iowa doesn't just get proportional votes by population, but two EXTRA votes (similar to the SEnate), except these aren't separated in power from their by-population vote, meaning that a voter in Iowa's votes are worth THREE TIMES what a voter in California's was... also, it's a bit disingenuous to say it was Cali's fault, as if no one else voted for him, that it came in ""at the end"" is what makes it look like that, but that's like saying NY doesn't exist.

In effect, the Electoral College *must* be scrapped, or *must* have two sides to it which must agree (split the 435 by population and the 100 which give 2 each... otherwise you're just unfairly bolstering rural citizens). 

**We can't pretend it's even *representative* democracy if the citizens votes aren't equal to each other.**

**The problem is that rural states now have disproportionate control of the country, which is just as much of a problem as urban cities having disproportionate control. Simply put, the founding fathers could not have forseen the kind of population we have, nor the capacity for cities to be *so* big and centralized.**",worldnews

You can change the definition of labour how much you want, but it doesn't remove the importance of some jobs. Some argue that philosophers and historians bring no value because they do not ""work"", while others argue that they do. Where is the distinction between value-adding labour, and non-value adding labour? Do burger flippers become worthless when robots take their jobs?

19007,"&gt; Let's take the technology ranking. You can see that the University of Toronto is 24, Waterloo 47, and McGill 76-100.

In every single ranking in every field, the best Canadian university is lower on the list than several American universities. There isn't a single broad subject in higher education in which Canadian universities outperform American universities. 

&gt; One thing about university rankings is that the universities at the top are virtually indistinguishable from one another because they're all so good.

Utter nonsense. They're apparently not indistinguishable considering there aren't many spots where universities tie. The ranking system I linked to does allow for ties though. If it were the case that all those universities at the top are equal, then there'd be more ties.

[Let's look at the field of physics.](http://www.shanghairanking.com/SubjectPhysics2015.html)

The US has almost all the top spots. Canada's best university, the University of Toronto, is in 44th place. Are you saying that the University of Toronto is actually just as good as the top universities like Harvard and Princeton? To make that assertion would indicate that you're either incredibly delusional or willfully dishonest.

You seem pretty desperate for mental gymnastics to obfuscate and explain away facts that you don't like. Canadians are so accustomed to hearing nothing but negatives about the US and positives about Canada, that when someone provides evidence that shows the US outperforms Canada in a certain area, Canadians basically wig out and can't rationally and sanely respond to it.

&gt; the average Canadian university is better than the average American university.

Lol. Let's translate: ""Even though American universities lead the world in every field, I'm going to warp the nuance of the discussion and boldly claim that, according to my own metrics, Canadian universities are ACTUALLY better, because that's what I want to be true and what I want bedevils my sense of reality!""

&gt; Fact is, Canada's higher education system is world-class and has nothing to envy to America's.

Canadians have such an all-encompassing, overcompensated inferiority complex that dominates their perception of reality so strongly, that they can't admit anything positive about the US. If a subject doesn't allow you to pretend you're better than the US, your brain shuts off.

20887,"I've got a couple things to say to that. First, the ""approaching full employment"" claim. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics there are 6.8 million unemployed Americans and 6 million job openings. Those numbers are pretty close together and unemployment is going down so that's good right? But then add the 1.6 mil that didn't look for work in the 4 weeks prior to survey and so aren't ""unemployed"", another half mil of people who simply aren't looking because of a perception of low job availability, and the real kicker: ""The number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers), at 5.3 million, changed little in June. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job.""

Part time employment isn't enough to get by and it's not exactly stimulating the economy. These statistics also ignore people who are working multiple jobs. This also ignores the rising cost of education in order to qualify for jobs that provide reasonable benefits and have room for advancement.

My absolute biggest gripe is that we don't even *need* ""full employment"" in this ridiculous country. Productivity per worker per hour has grown at an astonishing rate over the last century (four decades even) and advances in efficiency and automation are only going to improve that. But compensation for that productivity has lagged far behind so buying power per work hour has stagnated for [at least fifty years.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/09/for-most-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/) We're at a point where we don't actually need everyone to work in order to provide for everybody's needs, we just have a ridiculous social hangup against ""handouts"" and ""welfare."" We could cut the work week for almost everyone to twenty hours, employ everyone, and still be more productive than at any point in history, while giving every single American a higher quality of living through decreased stress and more time to explore other interests. When people don't have to work all day to survive they invent things, they philosophize, they make art. They do all of the things that have made the great classic civilizations interesting to study.

&gt;So how do we treat freethinkers asking sensitive questions in the 21st century West? In my own country, the Ombud for Gender Equality recently became The Equality and Antidiscrimination Ombud. Its duties include combating “discriminatory speech” and negative statements about other cultures and religions. If accused of such discrimination, one has to mount proof of innocence. In effect, this institution is a secular or Multicultural Inquisition: the renunciation of truth in favor of an ideological lie. Galileo Galilei faced the same choice during the Inquisition four hundred years earlier. The Multicultural Inquisition may not threaten to kill you, but it does threaten to kill your career, and that goes a long way in achieving the same result, whether your crime is claiming that the earth moves around the sun or that not all cultures are equal.


&gt;The control of borders and the sovereignty of nation states are linked to the list above. Democratic decisions are meaningless if they can be overruled by an external authority. This notion of sovereignty is being challenged all over the Western world both through the United Nations and through the ascendence of international law. Sovereignty is clearly not present in much of Europe, where seventy percent or more of all laws passed are federal EU laws. Democratically elected national parliaments have been reduced to insignificance. It is thus possible to argue that Western European countries are no longer distinct democracies, nor are they part of the “Free World” in any meaningful sense. Europeans thus have universal suffrage, but *we don’t have genuine democracy* and we certainly don’t have true liberty.


&gt;This dilemma can be solved by stating the following: Our goal is not democracy in itself, meaning elections and one man one vote, but freedom of conscience and speech, respect for property rights and minorities, the right to bear arms and self-defence, equality before the law and the rule of law - and by that I mean secular law - in addition to such principles as formal constraints on the power of the rulers and the consent of the people. Free elections may be a means of achieving this end, but it is not the end in itself. We shouldn’t confuse the tools with the primary goal.


&gt;If democracy is supposed to mean that citizens vote to decide their
future, then Sweden is not a democracy; it is a multicultural dictatorship. One can vote for a variety of parties, but all of them support the same multiculturalism and mass immigration. Ordinary Swedes have little influence over their own future, and freedom of speech is non-existent. But the country still has the formal aspects of democracy: regular multiparty elections take place. This should remind us once again that elections do not automatically lead to a free society.


&gt;The US Founding Fathers feared “mob rule” and tried to insulate the elected representatives of Congress from what they perceived as the fickleness of the general populace. I understand this viewpoint. We should be less religious about what is or is not democracy. Democracy should never be a goal in itself, nor should all legislation be passed according to the whim of the majority at a given moment. The ideal is a balanced and well-functioning system.


&gt;If we want a *permanent cultural conservative regime (despite our non-democratic methods)*, we have to reach out to inspire and earn the country's deep trust in our ideas and our leadership. We need their loyalty for the long run.


&gt;The most important thing to realise is that democracy is a tool, a means we use to achieve an end. Too many people now confuse it with the end itself. ""Democracy"" has come to mean something that is good, something everybody wants, a bit like sex or chocolate. But there is no rational reason to assume that democracy of universal suffrage is uniformly good and can be applied with equal success in all circumstances, a huge mistake Americans made in Iraq.


&gt;The king or queen of a country is more democratic than a president ever could be because he or she represents all citizens. An elected president would owe his selection to a political faction, and this would publicly divide him from many of his countrymen and would make his claim to represent ""the people"" less convincing. Frequent selections of presidents would interrupt the continuity essential for an effective head of a country. An elected president will always be partisan, whereas a monarch will not be. The king/queen and her heirs have been trained from birth for one vocation -- that of discharging the duties of sovereign of the country. Therefore, they are the only citizens fit to assume this important position.

You began saying they were delaying *""until the paying party feels they can take the hit""*, now you have shortened to *""decades""*. This alone is a huge difference.

Still, this is not true. Assuming the appeal decision is coming soon, the only possible ""appeal"" is a ""cassazione"" judgment which, albeit long, won't take decades. The decision of first instance was published in october 2009, which means that the whole second instance appeal is taking less than 2 years. 

The third (and last) instance would probably take a little longer, I don't have precise data, but let's say about 3 years. It is not impossible (altough really improbable) that the court of cassazione sends the case back to the appeal court. That could take something like 2 more years.

25287,"&gt;In 2007 the sentiment was that the failures in Iraq were because we'd bit off more than we could chew and not that we illegal invaded and destroyed the nation for selfish interests.

Those aren't mutually exclusive reasons. And the notion that we had invaded for selfish reasons was hardly unpopular by 2007 in the U.S. media. Only conservative outlets were keeping up the charade.

&gt; The media's treatment of the occupation is that it was 'untenable', which is the fucking problem since the treatment should have focused on what American GIs were doing to the local populace. 

If you think that those things weren't well-covered you were living under a rock. It was practically common knowledge by 2007 that the troops were generally not welcomed and far too many civilians were being killed.

&gt;. And now you still continue this idiotic line of thought that Iraqis can't govern themselves, using the evidence that the nation fragmented from instability and divisivness caused by the U.S invasion.

The U.S. invasion did not cause the Sunni/Shia split. It ""put the Shiites in charge"" only to the extent that we held elections and the vast majority of Iraqis are Shiite and voted for Shiite representation. That was democracy. And the subsequence Shiite government treated the Sunnis terribly. So yes, they were largely unable to effectively govern themselves at the time and did not seem to value consensus building or religious reconciliation. The U.S. invasion didn't cause any of that. The democratically elected Iraqi government did.

The U.S. fucked up. You can pretend all you want that I'm defending the U.S.' actions but that wont' be true. 

However that doesn't give the Iraqis a pass at all for being unable to resolve their infighting when given the opportunity to.

26878,"Defenders typically enjoy the ability of launching much heavier aircraft from land and from airfields which are not prone to sinking like aircraft carriers. China can use their full air force unlike the US which has to use their carrier capable aircraft only. If they have warning they can also position their forces in advance and lay naval mines. A defender can also use their coastal defense ships, the corvettes and torpedo boats, which are probably better than destroyers and cruisers on a per cost and per life basis aside from the fact that they cannot enter the open ocean. China also has some military facilities in the South China Sea though I honestly do not know much about that beyond that they are probably a good place to lob cruise missiles from. Then the attacker also needs fuel supplies which would be delivered by ships that are easy prey for either submarines or stealth bombers. The advantages a defender has in a naval war are arguably better than those in a land war.

&gt; the attacker usually has the advantage, as they can concentrate their force and strike at targets of their choosing

I do not feel like this is the case since most modern ships are at least semi-stealth, and it is difficult to first of all know where they are all located and second of all doing this would most likely mean walking straight into idling submarines. I could be wrong however I really cannot see how this would be the case.

&gt;Fact is, the US wouldn't need to wage what we'd consider a conventional military campaign against China. China needs immense imports, especially of petrochemicals, to provide for their population.

They can get them from places other than China. The fact is that a trade war would be devastating to the US as well and not just China however I doubt that it would be as devastating as most people believe. Contrary to popular belief China is not the US' largest trading partner and same goes for vice versa. In both cases their largest trading partner is actually the European Union and they are unlikely to press sanctions on China if the US decides to go all up in arms about the sea. If pressed however China can still import oil from Russia and the Russians would be very happy to provide it, since doing so would greatly help their economy and piss off the US as well. The Chinese are already importing oil from Russia actually. And then the Chinese have a considerable amount of oil on their own land, and the sea that they have claimed is also very oil rich. That is the whole reason why they have claimed it in fact.

&gt; Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte voiced his intentions to launch airstrikes against indigenous tribal schools that he claimed teach &amp;quot;Subversion and communism&amp;quot; and inspire students to become rebels, setting off a new round of concerns that the Filipino strongman may extend his brutal gaze beyond his drug war.

&gt; Duterte&amp;#039;s threats against schools run by the non-Muslim Lumad ethnic group follow skirmishes between government forces and Maoist-led rebels on the southern island of Mindanao, including a guerrilla ambush last week that left five members of the presidential guard wounded.

&gt; There have already been 68 military attacks against 89 Lumad schools since July 2016, according to Save Our Schools Network.

Without religion, it's almost impossible to imagine that homosexuality should still be stigmatized to this day. There's basically no argument you can make for why it should matter that men have sex with men or women or so forth. Religion shows off what it really is - old static morality.

I'd *love* to go work, even if it's serving coffee. I know I don't have the skill to do real work in my field yet and don't expect to be employed in that area right this second.

Nobody wants me. I put in applications to Starbucks and the like and never heard a word (although tbf I didn't really try as hard as I could have because I had summer school). 

I tried to get internships as well. They won't even let me work *for free*.

As for the girl situation, don't even get me started. Generally the pattern is if I'm not rejected straight off (which is the majority of results) she'll start ignoring me after the first date. Fittingly enough like jobs most girls are taken. I'm not going after 9s or 10s either. I go after plain girls and not as a compromise either, I genuinely like them. I've since given up that up as a goal since I cannot make any headway whatsoever.

So please, continue to berate me for my lack of ambition and accomplishment from your comfortable little ivory tower. Life is a little more complicated than what you can see. That's nice you made all the right decisions and met all the right people and got a mouthpiece to spew your nonsense from, but after I come home from college getting a degree that won't be worth anything (in a ""good"" field!)

In general, female porn stars are more likely to get shamed for having been in porn, or creepy behavior towards them. Male porn stars are more likely to get high fives. Not to mention that it's far rarer for the male porn star to get mentioned by name or otherwise really noted. That's bad if your goal is fame or success, but great for those who might worry about how others will treat them. Slipping into obscurity is easier. Your past career (or that one thing you did in college because you were broke and needed food) won't likely follow you around.

Arguably we should avoid and reduce the stigma related to porn, but we can't deny that as it is, such a stigma does exist and that heavily influences the likelihood of anyone wanting to do porn.

Arab there had a promised state, they were gready and screwed themselfs up, they keep complaining about it 70 years after. 

The land of the jewish people belong to the jewish people, not only the jews thet live there, you cant make it a private club, this has 0 logic.

&gt;B. They have been there since way before the 19 century, they deserved their land and by they I mean the Muslims, Jews and Christians that lived their since even before the ottoman empire, after the British mandate ended, they should have had their chance to declare their state from within themselves, but instead they faced thousands of foreigners being injected into their land and declaring their state

19th century is natives?

they had a chanch for a state, as i said before, were gready and wanted the entire land for themselfs  and had to face the consequences. anyone can declare their own state, but who exetly recognize it?

You dont seem to know anything about the zionist movement with the way you think and talk. The jewish people wanted a land for the jewish people especially after the holocaust. injected? the britians didnt allowed jews to enter even though they were being genocided? how exectly they were injected if they werent even allowed to enter? Israel was declared a state in UN vote, how exectly has it declared it own independence?


&gt;The British promised to give the land that weren't there's to begin with to European zionists after wwii, is rael was only created because some shady British polatics and after thousands were injected into the land. And regarding the war, is rael was heavily backed by US and UK, so realistically its UK, US vs the other countries

What are zionists? jews. what  homeland was promised? a jewish one.

The US had 0 involvement in this war, the only involvment thet the UK had was assisting the arabs and hurting  israel ability to fight.

The UN Proposed a soultion to divide the land to jewish and arab one, jews accepted it, arabs didnt they wanted the entire land. israel were declared a state with **UN VOTE, it cant declare its own  independence. Large Jewish immgration to israel happend decades before this. british mandate didnt allowed the immgration of jewish people.

&gt;some shady British polatics

But israel were declared by a UN vote, i dont get your point.
the closest thing to what you talk about is the Balfour Declaration there were about a homeland to the jewish people not a state and even this wasnt a promise, it was very vauge.

Even though we have ""democracy"" this is the case I believe, bank bailouts were voted down initially, then pushed through in an area where they could not be voted down. This encourages laziness because we are not fallowing our internal compasses. I believe that if we stop the system of hierarchy (which has been done in the past) and work off of a system of what I call an organic organization, then we have many people who are doing what they want, which equals more productivity through greater happiness. We can see an example of this with Anonymous, the organization works off of the willingness of individuals, not from the orders of a hierarchy. This is closer to a true democracy as defined by the ideal. It encourages happiness, which I believe is the goal of life.

The verses you bring up are not commandments Muslims are given that they must carry out, they are in fact re-tellings of historical events (at least that's how they can be viewed in a modern context).

Basically think of it this way, some parts of the Quran were unveiled to directly guide the Muslims during the days of the Prophet. So for example 9:29 as you bring up happened during a tense treaty between the Muslims and non-Muslims and in fact there was on going fighting and such. These verses were basically commands to the people it was revealed to at the time.

I do agree with you that the Muslims who advocate violence use these verses to justify the violence. However they very much deliberately go against the actual meanings of the verses. It's like opening up a novel, reading one line from one page and deciding what the entire story is about based on that one line.

These verses can only really be invoked in proper context, and last time I checked norway was not executing, torturing or in any real way oppressing Muslims which given the context in which tehse verses are writte makes them irrelevant.

It's a bit hard to explain in depth (and I'm probably not qualified to do so either), but there's some great reading material you can check out to actaully understand where I'm coming from. [Try here](http://www.theamericanmuslim.org/tam.php/features/articles/quran_929_commentary/) for just one example :)

&gt; Here in the capital, voting has got under way peacefully in many neighbourhoods but the election is unfolding amid a tense atmosphere.

&gt; Four months of protests against Mr Maduro and his plans for the assembly have left more than 100 people dead. The election has been heavily criticised by other Latin American countries as well as the European Union and the United States, which last week imposed new sanctions on members of Mr Maduro&amp;#039;s government.

41559,"I dunno about 30-40 years, putting such numbers is basically just guesswork.

But look at it another way:

You say 1 out of every 4 dollars is produced in the US. That means 3 out of 4 dollars aren't. Changes in that ""rest of the world"" thing are weighted 3x for every 1 of ours. That's a lot of money that could go to industrialization, commerce, research and development, etc.

In reality, that ""rest of the world"" is really just the EU plus a small number of other countries - Japan, China, India, Brazil, Canada, South Korea, Taiwan, and a few more.

As he mentioned, last year 92 countries had growth rates above 4%. China and India were at 10%+, Brazil at 7.5%, South Korea at 6.1%. Even first world countries like Germany, Japan and Canada had higher growth rates than the US, which was number 117. And yet the US produced a 2.8% growth rate, which is pretty darn respectable for a mature economy.

So it's not like we're doing very poorly, it's just that many countries are doing a hell of a lot better. This is understandable, since they have a lot of room to grow; many started off with 3rd world status and many are still there.

But the net result is that the US share of all those things you mentioned, such as the 1 out of ever 4 dollars we produce, or the amount of military that cash can buy, all go down *as a fraction of the total world output*. And this can happen pretty damn fast.

More worrying to me than dollar amounts and number of military bases are things that I think are better predictors of future performance, such as:

1. Number of research papers we produce per year. This is **far** from keeping pace with the growth in the rest of the world.

2. The performance of American kids in math and science and basic reading comprehension skills, in which we placed 29th out of 31 of the top industrialized countries in the world.

3. Deteriorating infrastructure - roads and bridges which are not being built at a pace in keeping with population growth, which are not being kept in repair. Telecommunications in which we lag far behind many European and Asian countries.

Stuff like that has serious consequences if you're making predictions about the future, because it's your growth pipeline, it's what will fuel tomorrow's growth.

Again, nobody is saying the US has lost already, just that the current trend is a decline rather than maintaining the status quo or advancing. Yes, we ""control space"" as you said, but people looking at NASA today which just retired the shuttle, visited the moon 40 years ago and never went back since, continues to cut back for lack of funds, can't help but think that this is exactly what ""decline"" looks like. We had the whole market in space launches once along with the USSR. Today, commercial satellite launches are more likely to be through ESA or the Japanese, or the Indians.

I don't think this trend will go away, because really our massive dominance over the rest of the world was something of a fluke of history that gave us a huge lead over everyone else. Europe was the only competition, and it was crushed after WW2. Asia was coming out of the feudal/dark ages. You couldn't expect that sort of thing to last forever.",worldnews

If I remove all cellulose from a piece of ""paper"" and replace most of them with plastics, can I still call it a piece of paper?

The reason this is important is because *only* bread can be transformed into the body of Christ (you can mock that idea, but you can suspend your disbelief for a moment just to think in their shoes).  If the ""bread"" is not really bread, then nothing transforms into the body of Christ (the sacrament is not valid).

It's more to do with the survival of a society, rather than survival of the individual, and it comes down to the social contract and the monopoly on violence. 

Terrorism doesn't have as a goal to ""kill a bunch of people"" it's goal is to destroy the monopoly of violence a state has. The monopoly of violence is the single most fundamental part of the social contract, in which the state is given the ability to enforce rules through violence, while the citizens can't. In exchange the citizens get security. It is fundamental, since without it, no government is better than a mafia or charity, and with it, any organization is a state. 

When people drive drunk, they aren't (in the mind of the citizen) contesting this monopoly on violence, since it's disorganized and purely random. When a gang puts people on the border of the neighborhoods it controls, and enforces its rules inside those neighborhoods, they become the state in there. That's what mafias do, when they ask for protection money. With enough terror attacks, people WILL stop seeing their state as having the monopoly of violence, and will start trying to protect themselves using violence. This is how gangs, mafias and revolutions happen, and it's the way societies get killed. This is the actual goal of terrorism, eliminating the social contract in your enemies societies, making the conditions ripe for you to swoop in, and provide security in exchange of enforcing your own rules.

44608,"I'll address all your points individually, but I honestly believe there is nothing that I can say that will change your mind. You seem to be entrenched in the belief that the DNC is not responsible for that loss.  Here it goes.  
.  
One - regarding Clinton's popular vote victory: this is completely to be expected. Most of the country's population is concentrated in or around major cities. Most of America's largest cities lean left. Source : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mayors_of_the_50_largest_cities_in_the_United_States . So the whole popular vote thing should be no surprise, as you seem to indicate. The guys at the DNC know the rules of the game. They knew the popular vote is worth Jack shit. It's about winning as many States as you can. Clinton was not the right choice to win over as many swing States as possible.  
.  
Two - about Trump being the worse candidate and therefore a "" no brainer"" election : An election is never about facts. It is about perception. The guys at the DNC know this. Yet they still ran one of the most unpopular Democratic candidate in history. That's on them. Source https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/31/a-record-number-of-americans-now-dislike-hillary-clinton/  
.  
Third - on the idea that the media portrayed Trump and Hillary as equally bad: That's just evidence of how shitty Clinton was as a candidate. No other Democrat would have been able to be painted as equally bad as Trump EXCEPT Hillary Clinton. She was a bag of damaged goods that came with a ton of baggage. The DNC knew this, but again got caught up in the hubris of ""there's no way she can lose against Trump"". Running a candidate that could so easily be portrayed in a negative light is on them.

A link for you: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy

&gt; According to political scientist Larry Diamond, democracy consists of four key elements: **(a) A political system for choosing and replacing the government through free and fair elections;** (b) The active participation of the people, as citizens, in politics and civic life; (c) Protection of the human rights of all citizens, and (d) A rule of law, in which the laws and procedures apply equally to all citizens.

**Without proper rights you cannot even have free and fair elections (requirement a)**, and if some groups can arbitrarily decide that parts of the people suddenly is not part of the people anymore then that is clearly anti-democratic as well, because requirement b would not be fulfilled anymore. Notice also that a system allows for total arbitrariness on the part of the ruling classes if requirement d is not fulfilled, and requirement d entails that citizens have more rights than just the right to vote (e.g. they also have to have the right to equal treatment by the legal system).

&gt; Yes you can. 

+

&gt; Wrong.

No you cannot. Vast parts of the people, including female citizens (see below) were not allowed to vote. That is not a democracy in any modern sense. Of course you can argue ""some very specific people still had the right to vote"", but that would be like calling a country in which only communists are allowed to vote a democracy.

&gt; **Second, the Periclean law formally recognized Athenian-born women as citizens in their own right**, and sanctioned their role in the continuation of the citizen body. Women until then were participants of the polis only in the sphere of religion, where they could hold priestly offices, and perform ceremonial duties in public gatherings. After the Periclean citizenship law Athenian women are recognized as participants in the state, even if not fully, and this comes with certain obligations.

They later had citizen status and yet they were not allowed to vote. Before that they were not even seen as citizens, which is also anti-democratic (see requirement b above).

http://www.ancientgreece.co.uk/athens/home_set.html

&gt; Male citizens in Athens could vote on all the decisions that affected the city and serve on juries. However, democracy was not open to everyone. Citizen women and children were not allowed to vote. Slaves and foreigners living in Athens (known as metics) were banned from participating in government.

It would require an upheaval of human civilization and a radical shift of consciousness. A shift so drastic it's even questionable if it's possible for consciousness as we understand it to exist devoid of the current method of perception.

I get the starry-eyed idealism of Star Trek and the post scarcity egalitarian future it portrays for humanity. I want that too. It's great to have dreams, even those that are unattainable can give us the hope of the unknown. But at some point reality must be obeyed. And reality as it is perceived by human consciousness right now is a classification system based on pattern matching. 

Any competition creates disparity which creates class divisions. Even without competition there will always be disparity created by natural physical differences. Disparity is simply a difference between outcomes.

Try as I might I will never run as fast as Usain Bolt. I could have started training at birth and trained harder and more frequently than he has. There are physiological differences one of them being a small but substantial difference in the size, shape, and I believe fiber consistency of our gluteus muscles that will make it so I can never be his equal. If we each ran a mile he'd win by a long shot and even if we weren't competing those numbers would exist and they would create a disparity. Differences and their resulting disparity will create classes of people.

What you are talking for is equity or the equality of outcome. Where we must handicap the exceptional among us to create parity with masses. This is collectivist, taking away from the individual to give to the collective.

What I push for is equality or the equality of opportunity, egalitarianism and meritocracy. This is individualism, to each their own.  

Under the definition of left and right that I gave, that would make equity the left side of the equation and equality the right side of the equation and the center would be neither equity nor equality, but any mix in between.

The beauty of the definition I am using is that you can apply it to any issue individually with the same level of consistency that it is applied to the greater context of the three primary axis of Governance, Economics, and Social Policy.  

If you think of everything in politics in terms of taking authority from individuals and giving it to a collective you can more easily define positions and place yourself along the axis.  

And what makes my definition the most correct? Besides the logical consistency, transparency, and easy of use? It does not making any judgements on the morality of either side and it leaves the judgement up to each person deciding their place on the spectrum. 

As opposed to all of the definitions that have been spouted in this thread that boil down to nothing more than ""everything I support is left and everything evil in the world is right."" Which is the most absurd, egotistical, self-righteous, self-centered, and lazy method of addressing political discourse imaginable.

Yes. There are no details, and no sources, for two reasons: firstly, the Irish Independent didn't investigate this, they've taken it from a wire service for news. This article isn't an investigative piece, it's just telling you the news that has been gathered by someone elsewhere. Secondly, sources are in there, but they're anonymous. Generally, compromising a source is a bad idea.

This is one source's account which is unproven, so while the paper can present the evidence as one person's story of what happened, it's still only alleged.

Last time there were riots on the mount, Israel and Jordan reached an agreement regarding placing security cameras in the place, but Jordan at the last moment rejected it because they didn't agree to the manner of their operation.  
This alone should already be enough for the Waqf to actively start looking for weapons stashed on the site.  
The Waqf didn't do that, despite Israel's trust (for lack of better word) in them.  
So now, Israel has no choice but to take security measures into its own hands, because the Waqf obviously can't be trusted.  

There's no way to hide it behind ""buts"" and ""ifs"" - the Waqf has no interest in actually maintaining security, either because they agree with the cause, or because they don't want to harm relations with West Bank Palestinians. Either way, it's not in their interest because they know they aren't going to be harmed by it in any way. Much safer to just let Israel take the brunt of the criticism, as it always does.

So what? During those 2000 years, the Jews have prayed 3 times a day for the restoration of Jerusalem and an end to their exile (and they still do, bizarrely). They never forgot. It was every Jew's dream to live in the holy land. Some Jewish religious authorities, like Nahmanides for example, maintained that it was actually a *commandment* from God to live in the holy land. 

&gt; Since that time--for two thousand years--the Jews did not run the place. 
So what? You don't get to take stuff from people, who desperately want it back, and tell them that ""for 30 years ever since you got kicked out, you wanted your house back. Too long, it's mine now!""

&gt; The Jews were barely a blip in the history or Jerusalem.
Yeah, just 800 years or so. That's not so much! Barely a blip!

He admitted to doing it, so the negative media focus on him is completely justified. Trump, on the other hand, has done no such thing. It may be your opinion that he is bad, but there is no evidence to support he is bad for the country or as a president at this time. Actually, the evidence is contrary to your opinion.

51965,"First; I believe part of the problem lies within the integration process of the country, but the blame is put on the opposite side by both parties. Ethnic Norwegians and immigrants.

Whereas Immigrants need to understand the behavior and cultural social norms of their past are needed to be, not necessarily disposed but conformed to their new society. That they cant expect their ideology to be forced onto others in the same sense ans others forcing onto them. 

While Norwegian ethnics need to understand that generalization of a general term of immigrants that overlap a vast majority of cultures and religions does not help in any form the possibilities of successful assimilations into said society.

Immigrants come to this country and receive instant denial, overbearing rejection, mockery of their whole identity by a society that should be open and more socially intellectual. The mass medias over hyped, sensationalized reporting of events that point out INDIVIDUALS within communities, that are radical and against the norm, to portray them as the general voice of said community, is a contributor to increased fear mongering and generalization on the subject of immigration and immigrants which results in further segregation of the two parties. There is evident failure of assimilation and integration, grønland is the perfect example of such failure, whereas foreign cultures have completely taken over the area to allow a society that does not need interaction with any Norwegian norms to continue to function. The segregation has caused a paranoia within immigrants that ethnic Norwegians have no desire to associate themselves with immigrants, they fear if they leave their cultural safe houses they will be met with further stigmatization and racism that would enclose what ever form of social activities they have now.

From Norwegian ethnics viewpoint, They see most immigrants as not members of their community but as foreigners who come to gain the benefits without having to integrate or assimilate towards their norms and force their own ideals upon the ethnic Norwegians. For them their viewpoint of the segregation shows that lack of desire to assimilate into the Norwegian society and adhere to the Norwegian laws, so they seek to confine themselves to safety by minimizing any interaction with immigrants at all. They also receive berating comments and harassment at times from younger generation of immigrants who in my mind lash out because of a young idealistic mindset of being already considered beasts they might as well behave as such.

**As for the case of rapes, per wikipedias numbers, todays immigrants in Oslo are about 25%, out of the 86 cases of rape , lets divide that number by 5 so ; 18 cases of rape per year on average. SO should those 18 people, be spokespersons for 150 000 Immigrants living in Oslo today?  We also have to take into consideration the subject upon which this data is presented, rape which is a subject females do not easily report for personal reasons. So i don't want to confirm to the statistics that 100% of all rapes are committed by immigrants. **

**But again this comes down to improper assimilation and integration of immigrants into Norwegian society, i believe these people should be extradited back to their home countries for committing such crimes, because the  Norwegian prison system is a luxury for them rather than a punishment. With concise strict extradition laws on any major crimes within the first 5 years for immigrants, would help to downplay the potential repeats of such behavior. BUT it doesn't rule out the problem that these individuals are using their ideology or religion as excuses to act out on these urges, it would be like saying people who are not religious never commit rapes, there will always exist deranged delusional people who enjoy committing evil acts, the possibility of becoming such person is greater when they come from backgrounds that have such instability and insecurity that many of these immigrants come from.** 

**But this doesn't mean all immigrants will become like this, it would be equal to say all right wing Norwegians can become like this madman. With proper assimilation, just basic understanding and respect. We can bridge the gap that allows such behavior to be even considered accepted before it even occurs**


The only way to ensure a better Norway is through proper educational process and assimilation programs, integration of immigrants without having to lose cultural values and beliefs is a much more likely result. Whereas todays lack of follow through, greater segregation between the groups, and greater generalized paranoia about ""potential risks"" create a almsot impossible scenario of successful integration and assimilation of immigrants.

European Catholicism was definitely not culturally similar to Protestant America. There was a great cultural divide between the two. Hence years of discrimination and isolation in ethnic neighborhoods. That lasted for a long time.

So what? Conservative Catholicism in the 19th century would have culturally more in common with conservative Islam than liberal Protestantism in the US.

Europe is hugely diverse and has a ton of ethnicities and cultures. Lumping them together makes no sense. There are cultures in Europe that would find more in common With the middle East than they would another part of Europe.


&gt;Those are some massive differences you've chosen to just ignore for the sake of convenience my dude

However, harder drugs are way too low imho, it doesn't take long to be able to go through 1 gram of heroin or 2 grams of cocaine in a couple days with habitual use, much less 10-days.

My main criticisms are that the decriminalized amounts should be higher if we are really trying to help people who have a problem and recreational users who aren't hooked to any substance. Also the fact that the amounts shown are supposedly supposed to be considered a 10-day supply when that highly variable from person to person.

The idea is that these people actively do and are, even more, defined by their role in the community makes them more ""prominent"" in the eyes of the people. 

Look, its not a matter of importance (as I've noted before). Its that these people (monks, doctors, teachers) are, in our minds eye, defined by their role as peacemakers and bringers of good. When you think about common folk like you and me, you're initial thought is not ""these are the portents of peace and goodness and models of society!"" Absolutely not. Our view of common people, like it or not, is often turned towards the ideas of a bunch of glutton, self centered, physically defined people. 

People can value others in different ways but that doesn't simply mean we discount their importance. We value a monk in a way that is different from the way we value a doctor or even a trash collector. We value a monk for his/her teachings of philosophy and religion while we value a teacher for his/her teachings of practical knowledge, a doctor for their ability to cure, even a newspaper man's ability to bring the news on time. A community will rally when those values are infringed upon. What you see here is an example of that. 

Don't limit yourself to what you just see here in the news. As I said, look at it in the grander scheme and you'll come to better understanding of why people do things like this, extremists or otherwise.

There should also be very few/small limitations on who can be a representative, because the people should have all the power to choose their representatives.

Compared to gerrymandering, FPTP, and campaign financing, this is a very minor issue. But that aside, I think dress codes should only be concerned with what's the bare minimum of necessary restrictions, given the nature of the work. And I don't care what a politician looks like.

I agree with almost everything you're saying, but I can't agree with the idea that *literally almost anybody* being able to own a gun plays no part in the trigger-happiness of cops. I'll offer a comparison. I live in the UK. It's definitely no oil painting when it comes to violent crime, but almost nobody owns a gun. Farmers, hunting lodges etc. That's about it. Number of people shot by the police in the last thirty years? About 50. Number of people shot by the police in the USA in January of this year? About 50.

Training absolutely is key; that's just what I was saying to the other poster above. In all of these videos that you see, what is striking is the total lack of attempts at de-escalation.

Just thinking outloud here more or less..

Personally for the most part I take no issue with it, there are plenty of places in public that covering your face can been seen as a problem that having say a list where  it is acceptable and not acceptable just seems silly to me. And if they would be willing to comply with such a list, than why wear it at all in public? I also get the feeling that many would feel the need to not comply with a list like that, for various reasons. On a somewhat joking level I am also personally just put off by the whole burqa thing because the genius idea behind it is that if I see a glimpse of the woman underneath that I won't be able control my sexual urges and I may just rape the shit out of her....seems a bit offensive to me..

 I know it seems like a minor inconvenience to have to ask a woman to remove her burqa for a second so that they can be identified but I imagine that there will be issues with people refusing to remove it even for quick identification purposes which leads me to think the law may expand in the future to be more like what france did.

My question I guess is, what is the difference between a burqa and just wearing something covering your entire face?

At the same time, I know girls who would have to know ahead of time if a guy was about to come over, because she would need to put on her hijab, even in her house. They would wear it at all times a male was present, but that was her choice- this was in America in 2016, and she didn't live with family and her roommates weren't even Muslim. But in that case, even when her brother came to visit, he would have to wait outside, for her to put it on. Even he doesn't see her w/o the hijab and they were freaking babies/grew up together. 

From my understanding (from an outside perspective obviously), it seemed like SHE would be deeply embarrassed and almost violated if a guy saw her w/o her hijab. Tbh, I would forget about that rule a lot, and if I had happen to see her w/o the hijab, and probably wouldn't even notice,... but she would feel weird about it. Again that's just on one experience. But in Iran, even though I'm not sure about in private, in public, if their mom was the only one w/e a hijab on, even if it weren't a legal thing, I'm sure the kid would feel embarrassed.

61415,"It's sad to see so many people on the left falling apart and becoming the thing they always criticized. Paranoid, conspiratorial thinking, following and sharing agenda driven stories strong in insinuation and absent in evidence. 

This is the same cancer that has been eating away at the right, and while it's always existed to some degree in the left, the Russian saga has brought it mainstream. There IS a Russia story and it's a damn serious one. I don't understand why people can't be content following the facts which are quickly developing without piling on fantasies. 

This ~half page article tells is that a man who once claimed he tried to get info from the Russians was found to have commit suicide and in his note stated it was not foul play. Okay those are the only facts of the article. The hot headline is supposed to get people like you all fired up thinking that this was a Russian assassination - gasp! Outrage! Pitch forks! 

This is also a man who made his Russian hacker contact attempts public, inference - attention seeker. Could this also explain his note - yes. Could it also be that he thought suspicion would be cast on his death and the sentiment in his note was a genuine attempt at clearing things up - yes. Is it logical - Not really, but how clear and logical should we really expect someone to be if they are of a state of mind to carry out suicide (even if it was for supposedly calculated financial purposes)? Is it more likely that he was assassinated by a foreign agent than it is that he was depressed and/or desperate for money? 

There are approximately 121 suicides in the US per day, excuse me if I think it's inappropriate to assume he was murdered by a foreign agent. This is exactly where this becomes Fox News/Breitbart style conspiracy thinking. The burden of proof is not on the rest of the world to convince you that it WAS'T an assassination. It's on you to prove that it is. And the article makes no effort to do so as there are no actual supporting facts.

62252,"&gt;Calvin Broadus, Jr., alias Snoop Dogg, recently released a music video for a rap song called “Lavender” in which he aims a handgun right at the skull of a clown dressed as President Donald J. Trump. Mr. Dogg — who pled no contest to felony gun possession in April 2007 — pulls the revolver’s trigger. Out pops a red and white flag that reads: “Bang.”

&gt;Hilarious.

&gt;Imagine the national collapse that would have ensued if, say, a country-music star released a video in which he leveled a shotgun at an Obama-like clown, only to have sawdust fly from the barrel.
‌
&gt;In response to muted criticism of Mr. Dogg’s video, rapper Clifford Joseph Harris Jr., a.k.a. T.I., called Trump a “F***ing Tangerine Tanned Muskratscrotum skin, Lacefront Possum fur Wig wearing, Alternative fact, Atomic Dog diarrhea face a** man!!!!”

&gt;Also from the relentlessly tasteful world of rap “music,” Big Sean’s freestyle number contributes this to the national debate:

&gt;I know Jay proud of me, he put this ’round my neck/ And I might just kill ISIS with the same icepick/ That I murder Donald Trump in the same night with.

&gt;Madonna, the global pop star whose albums have sold 306 million copies, erupted at the January 21 Women’s March in Washington, D.C.: “Yes, I’m angry. Yes, I am outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.”

&gt;Meanwhile, Adam Pally, star of Fox TV’s Making History, told TMZ that if he could travel through time and spend an hour with anyone, “I’d have to kill Trump or Hitler.”

&gt;Soon after Trump was elected, British journalist Monisha Rajesh remarked, “It’s about time for a presidential assassination.”

&gt;Matt Harrigan former CEO of PacketSled, a San Diego-based cybersecurity company, was eerily specific about his desire to whack Trump.

&gt;“I’m going to kill the president. Elect,” Harrigan posted on Facebook last November. He added that he was “getting a sniper rifle and perching myself where it counts. Find a bedroom in the whitehouse that suits you m*****fucker. I’ll find you.”

&gt;Two days after Reddit users noticed Harrigan’s vicious, error-filled death threats, PacketSled’s board of directors accepted his resignation.

&gt;None of this is cute or charming. The Secret Service should investigate all such episodes, including the Trump haters who have roped even America’s kids into their wicked schemes.

&gt;As the East Orlando Post reported, a University of Central Florida group called Knights for Socialism staged an event last month at which it encouraged visiting grammar-school students to use a baseball bat to smash piñatas bearing photos of Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and presidential adviser Steve Bannon.

&gt;None of this is cute or charming.

&gt;“Come beat Jeff Sessions’s face in,” said one organizer. “It’s free.”

&gt;On a video of the gathering captured by UCF College Republican Douglas Mactye, a little boy asks: “Can I kill Donald Trump?”

&gt;Peaceful protest is among the things that make America great. But no facet of the First Amendment shields those who promote the assassination of the President of the United States.

&gt;With millions of Americans in a state of perpetual rage, it takes just one deranged leftist to put Donald J. Trump in his crosshairs and pull the trigger. This is especially worrisome given the three security breaches at the White House just this month. In one incident, Jonathan Tran, 26, scaled three barriers and then spent 16 minutes strolling the grounds of the executive mansion while Trump was inside.

63875,"Yes, the entire human species does not pass on actual models of human beings nor the Universe to its children. Some attempt, but everyone would seem to have their limits when it comes to objectivity, and giving their child the fullest perspective. Of course, the ""lies of ommission"" here will be vast, but I'm sure we can find an explicit lie in almost every human being, and it must be almost because we can find silly cases like someone who doesn't communicate having a child because of rape or some such, and then ""that person doesn't tell lies"" and so on. My claim makes sense insofar as it applies to sensible people, but it's impossible to agree on a definition there. This is all if you want to get technical. I never know if people can just *see* these details or not.

And I can even make a technical definition, which says a correct definition. Here's what's actually going on:

Our environment is nothing more than ""configurations of matter subject to forces, which change the configurations of matter"". That's basically the simplest explanation of reality that I can give. Note that the environment includes human beings as well, so we are to be thought of as configurations of matter subject to forces as well. Then we have consciousness which somehow correlates with these configurations in what I conjecture is a ""1-to-1 correspondence or some other possibility that represents a definite mapping of matter to 'consciousness field'"", which is just a placeholder term for whatever consciousness is.

The point is to say that, if my arguments apply to the brain in terms of its ""matter configuration"", then they apply to consciousness somehow because of the matter-consciousness correspondence, correlation, dependence, or what-have-you.

Now, the only reason you ""understand"" what's going on in the environment, which includes models of the self, is because the patterns of the environment must somehow become ""maps"" or ""similar patterns"" or ""representations with 'sufficient' information"" in the mind. This means there are literally matter-to-matter maps from the environment to subset of that very environment, which is your mind.

I like Richard Feynman talking about ""matter jiggling around"". That's basically all there is - matter juggling around. And rather than there being nothing but chaos, the Universe has order, and we are part of this order, and we are a part of the order that reflects some of the order giving rise to the reflecting order in question. Just matter jiggling other matter is all this is, with consciousness ""along for the ride"" I conjecture.

Now parents pass on models to their children that do not reflect the actual order of things. The trivial thing to see is indoctrination. Are Nation States ""real""? They only exist as tribal mentality and facilitate conflict. That's why we have ""the pledge of allegiance"" and ""flags"" and so on. Are children told that being raised this way is the same as being raised in a small warring tribe at war with the small tribe across the river? It is - it's the exact same thing, only the necessity of war isn't apparent in such sheltered first-world environments, so the indoctrination is necessary, since ""the enemy"" can't be seen first hand.

This is how the human ape programs itself. It lies. It's also suicidal. And it's suicidal to program your child with anything but global citizen mentality, but then show how the world currently resists it. That's the only sensible thing for the human species to do. But it's impossible for this to happen. So what must the human species be doing in it's place? Lying.

But the real point is that we can consider the sum total knowledge we have in human minds and computers as to how the world actually works. And we can compare this entire bank of information, how it's networked together, and how information flows through and alters the nodes, how the network changes, and so on. We can consider our ""total mind"" and consider how well it reflects reality.

The answer is terribly, and the evidence is the state the world is in right now, and I don't want to write the list of examples, because it's lengthy, but climate change and ocean acidification are the big ones, and my main concerns are food shortages from extreme whether, water scarcity, and mass migration over the century. I can't see how this can lead to anything other than world war. Growing antibiotic resistance in the context of rapidly changing disease doesn't have me thrilled either.

Meanwhile the Govt last year had to deal with massive teacher strikes because some teachers weren't getting paid enough, and some werent getting paid at all.

People already lose their families and livelihoods. Whole cultures are already being destroyed. And a country on the verge of default who takes on short term cash injections is starting their economic development from the negatives, while at the same time keeping the same leadership that got them there.

The impact was negligible and then if you factor in 'imported emissions', which were conveniently excluded,  you'll find that most countries actually increased emissions.

So tell me how the Paris Accord has fixed the challenges the Kyoto Protocol faced.

Even if every single country meets expectations of the Paris Protocol (which they won't), once again, the difference in change will be miniscule that it will delay climate change by years, rather than actually fixing the problem.

The only argument I  ever hear about it is that 'it brings countries together...' That's not a solution when it's costing billions of dollars to do so without having any other major impact.

The drug trade solely exists for profit.  If FARC was profiting so much off it, it wouldn't matter because they can't do anything with the profits other than to wage a seemingly-endless war.  The cartels in Mexico are examples of this, the leaders live extravagant lives.  The life that FARC leaders live is not a life anybody wants to live.  It just doesn't make sense to me.

66580,"&gt;And who is ""they""?

Conservative political strategists and the GOP leadership, who know that they can point to illegal immigrants in order rile up support from voters such as yourself who are tangibly harmed by their policies.

&gt;My first ever job, back when I was 19 and trying to pay for college was lost because the owner of a chicken processing plant dumped me and about 40 other guys and replaced us with illegals. I was actively hurt by immigration. My father has been massively hurt as someone in landscaping. You can't even get a landscaping job now for even decent money in most places because it's overrun with illegals who are paid straight cash under the table.

I get it, and for the record no one is arguing that illegal immigration is completely free of negative effects like the one you outlined, just that the far more effective way of managing those problems is by punishing business owners like the ones who fired you for hiring illegal immigrants. I totally understand that it feels viscerally satisfying to see illegal immigrants being aggressively prosecuted, everyone can grasp that emotional draw, but *what about the businesses who hire them*? Is it not far more efficient to monitor those businesses than millions of disparate people living off the grid? Wouldn't it make more financial sense to find those companies, fine them, and punish those *american citizens who are breaking our laws* than to spend billions building a wall? 

And, to tie that into the first question you asked, who do you think the owner of that chicken farm donates to? Which political party do they support? Who do you think the GOP listens to, the chicken farmer who has scratch to donate or the broke, displaced workers? 

&gt;Im voting in my own self interest and the interest of those I love. You keep voting how the big wigs in NYC and LA tell you to though. They love that cheap labor and driving down your salary. I have a lot of friends who are democrats, but it is sad to see how you all vote to stifle and suppress your own wages.

This is just factually incorrect, and a perfect example of conservative interests pushing a bullshit narrative that you're too eager to believe. There is only one party which is pushing for worker protections, a livable wage, decreasing the wage gap, and that's backed up by their voting record. The last Senate vote on increasing the minimum wage? [All but one Republican senator voted against it whereas all but one Dem voted for it.](https://projects.propublica.org/represent/votes/113/senate/2/117). 

Name a single workers rights issue that is important to you, and I can guarantee the GOP has either voted against it or passed legislation limiting it.

&gt;Or would you consider it more plausible that the vast majority of people being shoehorned in 1 way of life filled with metric tons of marketing and products changes their traditions?

I think happy people don't buy shit to fill the void in their heart. Many things make people unhappy, being among strangers being one of them. Perhaps you are right that the more likely cause is an urban, productionist lifestyle though.

&gt;We have had cultural exchanges for centuries without the creation of music ""dying"".

Fair point, my anecdote about making music with the family is silly, If anything destroyed that tradition it was the advent of the radio.

&gt;The mixing and sharing of cultures is an old tradition that has not accelerated at break neck speeds despite modern changes since it ultimately requires 2 humans to have a genuine interaction

On the contrary, I think it genuinely has. China and Japan are nothing like they were 150 years ago and that is entirely due to the effects of worldwide travel, enabling the spread of ideas and trade from Europe to them. The crisis of the inability of those cultures to compete with western culture led to drastic violent change. That's not to say they were monolithic or even that they were unchanging for thousands of years, but the pace of change IS increasing.

&gt;The solution to multiculturalism is not monoculturism. Besides people have terrible taste and I do not wish to depend on them to pick the correct ""mono""

I'd agree with you on that, It seems impossible to put the genie back in the bottle, certainly not without trampling over peoples human rights. I just don't know how to make our societies healthy and happy. I think people naturally wish to be involved with the people most like themselves(based on any number of factors, race not necessarily being the most important). I also think that people will naturally homogenize themselves, if that weren't the case we wouldn't have issues with political echo chambers.

So there seems to be two forces diametrically opposed to one another. Modern societies tendency to place people into a cultural ""blender"" and peoples natural desire to be surrounded by those they see [commonalities with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight). I don't think people are happy when they are torn between opposing forces, and I worry that humanities tendency towards violence will only be exacerbated by this. Even worse is these fault lines in our culture can grow vaster when there is economic downturns. Political opportunists can exploit these fault lines for their own gain, often at the expense of human rights. I would prefer that our societies minimize the likelihood of those fault lines forming in the first place.

&gt; &amp;quot;A bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Castro and Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, sought to protect Global Development Lab funding through fiscal year 2021. Both congressmen have praised the lab. According to a USAID spokesman,&amp;quot;the 170 breakthrough innovations&amp;quot; funded by DIV &amp;quot;have reached 13 million people in poverty and resulted in $5 in additional funding from outside investors for every tax dollar spend.

68589,"&gt; You are a layman who reads clickbait headlines and thinks he has an inkling on where Russia fits into the global stage.

You have no idea what I read. The fact that you are willing to plunge ahead with claims like that that you have no evidence for undermines your well thought out and sourced post representing a bullish outlook on the Russian economy and investment. Maybe defending the motherland gets you emotional, I don't know. 

As to you actual arguments. Russia being so reliant on the nat. resources sector, particularly oil/gas, is a long term liability. To mitigate global warming, we simply cannot burn all the oil and gas left in the earth that we know about. So states like Russia and the gulf Arab states are counting assets that ultimately they will never be able to access. If they are allowed to, it means a pretty bleak future for our planet. Additionally, there has been substantial public reporting on the continued falling cost of renewables. We have already seen investors pulling back from fossil fuel projects due to this trend; if the trend continues at even a modest pace renewables will supplant oil/gas as primary sources of energy in the next 40 years. 

On the subject of their investment in education and healthcare, they were ranked 112th in 2012 in terms of spending on education as a percentage of GDP. You also mentioned healthcare, where they lag behind the OECD despite some improvements. Think for a minute about how Russia got to its current ranking. Decades of mismanagement and cronyism under the Soviet system and then the looting of the country since the fall. Coming out of the cold war, Russia should have been able to lower military expenditure and make investments. Most of the stability created by Putin has been by limiting political and personal expression in the name of right-wing conformity. IMO, a country cannot be successful in the long run without substantial investment in its future or a functioning civil society. Is it improving? Yes. Should and would it be much further along in its progress if it wasn't so terribly managed? Yes. 

Why does Reddit hate Russia? Well, Russia is a notoriously anti-democratic country with poor human rights policies and records. Russia is anti-LGBTQ to say the least and persecutes a number of marginalized groups. Reddit trends left of center, so those stances are not going to be popular. Also, the well documented spamming of sites like reddit by Putin bots is fairly annoying.

I understand your point about the implementation of such a system being 'easier' in Norway, or rather, any country that isn't the United States.


In that the United States holds 25% of the world's prison population, while being 5% of the worlds total population. And it would be extremely difficult for *any* country in the world to implement under those conditions.


I understand your acknowledgement of the complexity of the issues in the US prison system, specifically in the question of 'who' and 'how.'

Why does the country that thinks it's number one in freedom have such an astoundingly huge skew of prison population. In my mind at least, those two concepts can't exist side by side. What could these people possibly have done to deserve that?

I find the United States attitude towards incarceration very scary. Prison isn't a healthy place to be, nor is it an easy place to come out of, and integrate into society again. It can cause long term damage to a persons psyche and mental health. A negative effect that will be with that person for the rest of their lives, and the lives of people around them.
