40,"You are clearly on the shy side. I was too. The problem is that you're expecting other people to go out of their way to include you, but you aren't being proactive and talking to others.

It's uncomfortable, but **the best way to have good friends is to BE a good friend.** You want people in smaller groups to communicate with you, but you never form groups and you never reach out to other people who might be feeling equally ""outsider""ish.

You talk about how you wish people in raids would talk to you, but then you don't, because you'd freeze up. The truth is that this is 100% a comfort-zone issue for you. If you keep acting the same way, you are **going to have the same results**. I'm sure you have taken this shyness to be a character trait that you have and can't change. But the truth is you're more complex than that. Because now we know that you are content with being shy -
 however, your shyness is causing other problems that you aren't content with. These problems you're having will not solve themselves - only you can do that by growing as a person and pushing your comfort zone.

Your options are to try and grow as a person by reaching out to old and new guildies and focus on **being** the friend instead of **having** the friend - or you can look for a smaller group and hope they never get big. I know which one looks better to me.

-----

You consider yourself a person of value, right? And you think you'd be a good friend to someone if they just came along and decided to include you. All you need is someone who is more social to just include you, and you'll just show how valuable you are.

I have a spoiler alert for you - there are a ton of cool, shy people just like that. And the only thing stopping you from being the guy who pieces all these unique awesome friends together is your mental hangup about being social. Push yourself to grow as a gamer and as a person! I believe in you!",wow

163,"Been wanting this back since I hit 110. Legion is full of rng. Almost everything connected to loot is rng. Thats what you get when you let Diablo3 to develop an expansion (diablo3 has its moments, but its a truly boring grindy boneless game). Sure, grinding valor or whatever currency isnt the best system, but it offers you a sure payment for your work, as opposed to playing the lottery game on full tilt. Sure, you could have some tf/wf left in the game, but id rather FOCUS my upgrades, rather than get TF on an item I dont need, or random crap stats. 
IF you have played diablo, and its absolute sick rift grind system (get the fotm set to be even remotely useful, then grind the same pieces again in a ""TF/upgraded"" state to be stronger, or play the Kadala lottery) then you see, that you can basically draw a equal sign between legions and D3 loots system. These games are not the same, and the loot system should not be the same.
Basically it boils down to luck (as with legendaries). You will feel a sense of joy when you get the right leg/tf/wf, and utter dissapointment when you dont (or dont get loot at all). Kadala lottery (oh sorry, nethershard), is a weak way of offering consolation prize (use an 5k costing item, that says it will roll your spec item, but instead it gives you absolutely opposite stats you need, totally wasting your shards for that spec). 
I need, NEED, a way to keep hunting towards something. Right now i've lost all interest in doing mythics, because  as fun as they might be - i know in the end, the lottery gods will decide my pay.

227,"I think style wise that I deal a lot more damage than most Discs, likely from not holding onto Penance very often. I've been working on being more cautious with my PWR charges as well to ensure that I am using them a bit less aggressively and can hold onto them for the largest damage points in the fight, so long as I'm not holding onto them for too long. 

How much you're firing away with applying Atones also depends on how long the encounter is, as you can be very aggressive with applying Atones if the fight isn't going to be super short. 

For SMend I'll generally use it if a target is reasonably low HP and needs some spot healing. Using it on the Spear debuff targets on Desolate Host or just anyone that drops too low. Its pretty high HPS but is just more costly than Plea, so you have to make sure that you're being as efficient as possible with SMend casts to reduce overheal. ",wow

There are very strict guidelines and rules for driving on the road. Which is why you don't have to put up with people breaking the rules.
Same goes for WoW and PUGs. There are very clear rules in place in the game. For example the greed roll system or the vote kick options. Everything else, is not regulated and up to the players. So yes, if you choose the Dungeon finder, you will have to live with the fact, that others play whichever way they want to.

The rules you make up are exactly that, made up rules, made up by you. No-one else has to follow them and you most certainly don't get to decide which arbitrary rules everyone has to follow.

2135,"BM is still viable for leveling, but you'll rarely see anything but SV or MM in dungeons or raids. Unfortunately, your high-dps BM pet at melee range can rip aggro from the tank, even when growl is disabled.

Having said that, your primary rotation for BM is to apply Serpent Sting first and hit a few Arcane Shots until your pet is at the mob. Then hit Kill Command, and either two or three Cobra Shots to build your focus bar back up. At this point, you won't need to reapply Serpent Sting because it is refreshed by CS, so your rotation from this point is ~~Attack~~ Kill Command, Arcane to dump focus, and CS to rebuild. Once the mob is below 20 percent health, you can use Kill Shot, and if you're glyphed for it, go ahead and use the freebie second Kill Shot.

If you're sticking with BM, change your rotation slightly (and this will lower your DPS) to avoid using ~~Attack~~ Kill Command if you are grouped with a Bear or Warrior tank, as your pet will continually rip aggro off even the best of them. DKs and Pallys tend to be better at maintaining threat on multiple targets, so you're safer pushing for deeps behind them.

Yes, I will have the chance to earn some higher ilevel gear in the future, but I know I can just log out now, and log back in in 5 months or whatever and my AP/AK will be reset and completely invalidated, without having done anything.

Gear works because you have to at least go out and earn it, but with the current AK system you just sit there and wait for the inevitable reset that you can do nothing about.

I was wondering if you could give me some insight into max DPS for trash packs. When is it best to use beam, should I be using blade dance on CD or my cleave for more fragments and therefore more cleaves in meta window? 

Currently I've been dashing, demons bite for enough fury to Eye Beam and dropping artifact ability and doing one blade dance followed by cleaves until window is over. I could get two blade dances out in that window if possible though. Also, I feel like cleaves giving me fragments and reducing my eye beam CD means more uptime so maybe that's what's best?

Also, is there a useful alternative to momentum for this sort of build? I just dislike having to work position and timing around like that, especially for boss fights. I was thinking of using nemesis just to have a single-target cooldown for boss fights.

Currently, I'm only clearing +5-8s as I'm still gearing up and doing LFR (about 870 iLvl, no legendaries yet) but I figure best to ask and get set in the right ways before I get great gear and then am left to wonder what I should have been doing the whole time.

you see the pattern here? My ""utility"" saves *one* person

Warrior utility saves the ***whole raid***.  Idk who you are or what you play, but I've been a ret pally for a decade and I've literally never had less useful utility.

5135,"I know you just hit 85, so you probably aren't going to level an alt soon, but let me make a suggestion for the next one, as I level a ton of toons. It looks like you are about 5-10 quests into Twilight Highlands, which means you were 84 in Uldum for a long time. 80-85 goes much more quickly if you use the level-appropriate zone as SOON as it is available, rather than finishing off each zone before moving to the next, which is what I assume you did. Hyjal and Vashj'ir are parallel to one another, so you can choose either one for 80-82 (I choose Hyjal because I like it better), and if you choose Hyjal, you can actually finish the whole zone, even though you will hit 82 a while before finishing it. The reason in this case is because the last portion of Hyjals quests are not only very entertaining, but quite experience-efficient. So I usually do every quest in Hyjal, which gets me within a few bars of level 83. Then I go to Deepholm (82-83) until level 83, and as SOON as I ding, I move to Uldum (83-84) until hitting 84, and again, as SOON as I ding, I move to Twilight Highlands until 85. The difference in experience-rate of these zones is great enough that it is much quicker to move along as soon as you ding. (again, except for the case of Hyjal to Deepholm, as the last quests in Hyjal are quick with high xp.)

Come to find out, she was showing her tits to a majority of the males in the guild on Skype, and suddenly felt threatened by me, thinking I was trying to lure them away to start another guild/raid team. She was the straw that broke the camel's back. I steer very clear of most females in game now. I don't make friends easily as it is, and she broke my heart.

""But yes. I do my best to not clip dots"" - It's OKAY TO 'CLIP' YOUR DOTS!  You just have to make sure they are in the less than 1 tick remaining. You WILL NOT see a Dps loss.  (In Cataclysm, Blizzard changed it so that if there is less then 1 tick remaining, it automatically reapply's your dot with that extra tick preloaded on the front.)  [for example:  assume your VT lasts for 14 seconds,  If you 'Clip' on the last tick, the time on VT will go up to 17 seconds, and you'll still get that tick in before you need to refresh again]  &lt;1 tick remaining is the best time to refresh your dots because it's a 100% uptime.

Latest expansions give the best gear, nerfed after next one comes out but people who had it keep it.

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*! 

**Okay, so how do I start?**

5854,"I recently tried [Adibags](http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/adibags.aspx), it was pretty cool, just bagnon fits my preferences more.",wow
5868,"If they wanted to bench you I'd be on your side because attendance and performance should be the two biggest reasons for a raid spot.

But that's not the issue. Doesn't sound like you do anything for the guild outside raid and you're not getting any attention outside raid.

People who are talkative in raid are typically talkative outside raid too. They will like to play with other talkative people. People who consistently put in effort to make groups and run keys find a consistent group.

You didn't answer my other question which was if they need DPS why bring you, specifically? If the only thing you contribute is high damage a PUG can do that.

You can change guilds but I think the same thing will keep on happening. People try to include new players make them feel at home and welcome but eventually the ""smell"" wears off and if you don't put in time building relationships outside raid you won't have any.

Really not different than a new kid in school getting attention for the first couple weeks. After that they either make friends or are forgotten. Can change schools again but that's not really a solution.

5883,"&gt; Threat is different, classes have been completely reworked (smoothed out ""rotations"" simplified talent choices, baseline qol changes across the board).

Rotations were **way** simpler during TBC though. One Button macros were a thing (even in WotlK for some classes) and some classes got away spamming a single spell 95% of the time (WLs for example).

Also talent choices were rather trivial when it comes to actually changing anything gameplay related. Yes, you could put tons of points into something like ""5% more crit"" etc but in terms of adding a new ability or changing the rotation there were less choices than today and hardly any at all if we're talking about reasonable choices.",wow

Literally nobody online besides raids nights.



Long Edit: Seems like the Rose Colored Goggles are the happening mog in this thread. I'll explain, but I'm sure be I'll be told how I'm all wrong.

Group has been together since the end of MoP, and some of us have made 10/10 M EN ToS and NH. 

No, we're not interested in running M+ anymore: the balance is garbage, the affixes aren't fun, and the drops are almost all disenchanted. GRINDING them over and over is sickening at this point. We just want a 15 done. Too bad that extra AP and 930 in the box is almost always useless.

No, we aren't doing WQ or really world anything anymore: The quests are repetitive and boring, OR are useless as most of us sit on 100k+, and the Paragon boxes are garbage that we're tired of GRINDING.

No, we aren't rolling alts anymore either. Besides having to deal with M+ and WQ woes above, you're now playing the leggo lottery! Better hope you get them! Even if you do, enjoy the GRINDING it took just get to a point where you have the proper rotation. Now go get the wrong relics and trinkets for 3mos.

No, we're not organizing PvP: The gear and AP are useless, the honor grind is ridiculous and unrewarding, and it's a retarded melee CC tunnel fest. I mean, people who I've seen heal or cast in PvP for years have got melee alts just for PvP now, because why punish yourself? We don't even talk about arena because so many people are turned off by it.

No, we aren't immersed in the story enough to want to participate: The suramar journey was great, but Legionfall dropped the ball so hard it's like WoD where the main design team had moved on. Feel free to grind there too. Give me a pair of the orange light up cones and I'll wave the sentinax over to the mage tower myself, the whole place is atrocious.

We cleared ToS and nobody feels the need to keep up with the bullshit anymore. People still don't have certain legs, hidden appearances, the fuckin fox mount, rank 3 yadda yadda, faction mounts, or the actually useful relic that only drops from two M+ we've done 200 times each. Truth is, nobody really cares anymore. Hell, we regularly talk about how if the rng actually ever hits for something, we'll be too jaded to even wear/ride it.

For those of us who have it all gear wise, or close enough, where is the game? Getting one shot by crazy overtuned tyrannical bosses? Declining classes until you have the exact group comp to deal with a 17+? So you can get blown up by the other rng affixes? Because the end game m+ scene is not at all mob/boss/affix tuned or class/role balanced. 

It doesn't feel like a game, just spinning my rotation to another rng box, it feels like a chore.     ",wow

What makes affliction perform well on charts like this is not that it's best on every fight, it's that there are no fights it's outright bad at. Much like how frost DK was in Nighthold. Combine that with the fact that affliction is pretty easy to play and has extremely high survivability and you see charts like this. ",wow
7307,"idk man the current meta has replaced Mage with Boomkin for most comps. And honestly the game would be so dull without comps like RMP. Who really wants to fight against TSG or turbo that win by sheer damage? There was even a thread about what comp was most interesting to face on worldofpvp, and most people said RMX in spite of how much people complain about it. 

I'm not saying legion is fantastic, but it would be a lie to say it is all mages and no comp variety. Legion has definitely had a ton of comp variety and decent class representation (especially in tourneys). it did kinda feel that way recently because of how strong RMP was, but that was only a few weeks of legion's whole span.

Similar to the streaming landscape, every guild that has gotten to or cleared the final bosses of ToS is extremely good. That means when people watch a streamer that's on KJ right now, or look up a raid comp on a given kill, they probably see certain classes under or over represented.

This is mainly because the game is basically for kids with ADD now. Leveling and gearing goes by really fast, I can't replace most of my visible items because its all BoA, I don't get into the toons because the process is all too quick, the reward factor is practically non-existent now that everything is handed out. This all ruins the replayability of the title (when blizzard tried to force everyone to end-game). We have a lot more nubs at higher levels now (including complete failure to even work towards the objective in battlegrounds), gearscore is a bit of a pain (more-so in WOTLK) for OP DPS classes that could top charts with low GS. Also, now that I have five toons at end-game (and could get a new toon there in 2-3 weeks with casual play), the joys of figuring things out, see and trying new things is gone.    

TL;DR - Can get through the game quickly, effectively, acquire bragging rights, wealth, be above average on my toon an all without even putting in the slightest bit of effort. The game is easy and the rewards are handed out.

8597,"Alternate leveling my alts when they are rested, and playing tf2.  Dont raid as I cant get home in time for my guild raid, kinda depressing actually.",wow
8675,Mythic dungeons and then mythic+. As well as all the LFR you can do. I  had an alt hit 110 on Tuesday and am currently on 895 doing that.I played a lot on this alt though but getting to 900 seems fairly easy to do atm,wow

8832,"sure, but to benefit from it there needs to be significant misplay. even if you're missing a global every time it comes off cd (you shouldn't) you would need 4 casts of KS before you got 1 additional cast.... and that's a lot of mis play",wow
8846,"There would be a limit of 60 blood elves per realm. 20 gnomes per realm. And 50 draenei per realm. Those numbers are limited becauss lore-wise, those races were split up or genocided (or both) to the point they're limited in numbers.",wow
8868,The reason I don't want to come back to wow is because legion is just Farmville where you go do stupid world quests and click shit to start a timer in class hall. Flying mount requiring to grind a rep is just the cherry on the cake ,wow

9095,I don't even want to think about it lmao. I have hellish flashbacks to some of my depleted keystone runs because of her and my idiotic group. haha,wow
9099,I explained myself in another comment. I do this 30 % for actual cancer prevention and 70% for putting my paranoid mind at ease. Been struggling with mental illness all my life and this shit just scares me so much man,wow

9286,And then you have the Demon Hunters screaming on and on about how THEY sacrificed everything...,wow
9295,"On your enhancement shaman, do you have Pathfinder, Part One? Do you have AK 25? Do you have a stockpile of order hall resources?

If you have Pathfinder, Part One or are close to it, then getting Part Two would be pretty easy and definitely worth doing before leveling an alt. If you have AK 25 and a stockpile of order hall resources, you can get to AK 40 in about three days, and then you can buy an item that will instantly get your alt to AK 40. ",wow
9298,I just recently figured out how to get in undercity tbh though. ,wow
9311,"I doubt that. I only pvp in this game and because I don't have one ""main"" so to speak I know I will never accumulate enough honor on one person to get these mounts. I need to ignore other characters I enjoy playing to have a chance at hitting the max prestige. Probably doesn't help that I came back to the game at the end of season 2. ",wow
9347,But reporting is 100% irrelevant to this situation. OP could call his local police department and they will do about as much as Blizzard. Don't get too mad that your advice is quite literally useless.,wow
9356,"That's exactly what I'm talking about. Yes, you can already deplete, but it's annoying to do.

Currently, you 3-chest your 15 or 16 into an 18 or 19 of some crappy dungeon. Now your key holder has to zone in solo, start the dungeon, zone out, reset instances, repeat 2x, because nobody wants to run 19 CoEN. This is even worse with upper kara where you can't just zone out and have to port out every time and run back.

Alternatively, you could wait out the timer at the end before killing the boss to make it a 1-chest, but that can take even longer than zoning in/out to deplete if you beat the time by a significant margin. Plus it's boring and feels bad.

Instead, you would be able to just rclick the key in your bag, accept the confirmation box, repeat 2x, and you're good to go. No loading screens, no instances/hr limit, no dropping group and getting reinvited (or having the entire party sit through multiple load screens).",wow

1) We're talking about the sexual tension between Illidan and Maiev

2) I make a joke about them fucking

3) Someone makes a joke about people drawing porn of that

4) I said her voice makes me think I don't want to see Maiev naked



And you're twisting in the wind as hard as you can saying that I'm judging her VA?

Do you know what the term ""voice actress"" means? Actress. Actresses act. That's probably not her natural voice. It's something she chose to fit the character. And since you don't see Maiev unless you do the BRH line, then yes, people are going to fucking judge the masked woman swaddled in as much armor as possible and one that looks like literally every Warden model in the game, by her voice.

I don't give a fuck about the voice actress's looks when I'm talking about porn between two fictional characters who don't exist. I'm fucking amazed that if I had just said ""voice"" and not the term ""voice actress"" then you wouldn't have gotten twisted up.

And guess what? I'm not saying that I'm the most attractive guy, but I also go long periods with sex or dating perfectly happily. I'm talking years. I'm a picky fucker. If I don't like a girl, it doesn't matter what her looks are, I've no problem turning her down. 

If she smiled at me from across the bar, then I'd buy her a drink. But if she talks to me and sounds like Maiev, then I'm going to excuse myself as politely as possible.",wow

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*!

10884,Pretty sure every raid mechanic people just stand in would be excruciatingly painful. ,wow
10899,"Honestly I'm more annoyed that not all classes have the free world quest every day thing. I love it, I've got every alt that has it to at least prestige 1. ",wow
10920,"That pretty much sums it up. If you were to join a fresh raid with your Shannox kill, the raid would then be prompted to enter on your lock (1/7).

If you join a raid that has already killed Shannox plus other bosses then you will be prompted with their raid lock (?/7).",wow
10936,"Jaina went a little far, but she tried to purge Blood Elves from Dalaran because Blood Elves used it as a staging ground to infiltrate and steal something from Darnassus. ",wow
10954,"Yeah, I'm half convinced Blizzard never wanted housing, so they added Garrisons as a poison pill to turn off the player base from ever asking for 'housing' again.",wow
11010,"I don't know about you, but I sure as hell don't log onto PTR to farm world mobs and do world quests in a zone I've already been through knowing that they don't benefit me at all.

Wasn't their logic something like ""We put it on the PTR and didn't get many complaints"", which is all fine and dandy, but so few people use the PTR and mostly they're using it to test some specific new feature.
",wow
11020,"Yeah. It locks onto your target's nameplates -- requires the nameplate active and visible.

It actually is rather smoothly animated, which is nice.",wow
11026,"Yea I'd probably be fine with that. A little bit of a bonus for the good feeling, but it's not so much that you feel like you need to farm old content for the titanforges.",wow
11029,"use brw if you want it to be a lot smoother, since it allows you so much stuff like outbreak as you approach the boss. personally I do brw prepull &gt; outbreak as I approach the boss &gt; festering strike &gt; if fallen crusader procs I use cold heart, if not I apo if i'm at 6 stacks (because brw+fs), if not at 6 stacks and no fallen crusader proc still I just cold heart here (don't wait too long), in this time you'll get 6 wounds for apo through brw hitting twice and that one FS so you apo, army (I don't army prepull, works great like this since the runes doesn't matter since you're going to go into DA and spend RP as they regen and this maximizes the 2pc bonus dmg) &gt; DA if full RP",wow
11045,"I've seen the ""go back to WoW, kid"" thing on several other MMORPGs. Rift, Aion, Tera, BDO, GW2, just to name a few. 

I've even seen it a few times in non MMORPGs, like during HOTS promos.
",wow
11048,"Lore wise we (the raider) we aren't just some scrub, you have to understand that. WoW has been working on actually giving us some agency to affect the world.

Sure, at the beginning we all start off as some random dude. But over the times we've answered the call of our faction leaders and have proven time and time again our might, power, and nowadays wisdom.

Back in WotLK we were but pawns fighting *for* the Crusade to stop the LK.

Today, each player character (ok don't think about that too hard) is respectively the leader of their class order. If you're a paladin, all other paladins look up to you for guidance, mentor ship, wisdom. They look to you for answers, and you give them orders on what to do to advance the cause. **YOU** have become the leader of the ""crusade"" against the Legion. **YOU** have been entrusted with the awesome powers of Ashbringer, the legendary weapon capable of shattering Frostmourn, to use against the Legion.

The leaders of the alliance and the horde look up to you for guidance now. You're treated as somewhat like an equal, because you've led armies against the armies of the old gods, the fallen, the corrupted, the dead, the demons.

In terms of in game power, you're like Captain America: peak physical performance.",wow
11116,"So first off...at your ilvl, the people doing 90s have Shoulders/Wrist Lego, 4 sets (some being LFR) with CoF+another good trinket.  So, don't punish yourself for that.  Not having a CoF hurts you a lot.  Id would prioritize H NH in your raiding so you can fish for better legos + get that trinket.

Secondly, as I am making the switch to sub (only 1 ToS raid so far)...I am finding it very penal for fucking up SDs.  I can't tell if you are (because I cant look at logs right now), but my first 50% parse was on Maiden where the mechanics are pretty brain dead.  I then did a like a low double digit parse on Avatar because where it drops you in DfA is craziness and I wasn't prepared on how to plan around the pools n such.

So, Sub has been popular enough and ToS has been open enough that the people that logging the fights are generally familiar with the spec and understand the windows to do damage.  Whenever you are looking at parses, understand that.  Also, it could be that 30-40k difference moves you dramatically because of the Std Dev of the distribution.

",wow
11145,Next expansion. Cataclysm 2.0 we're due for a world revamp right? ,wow
11151,Why would you skimp so much on ram and processor...,wow
11157,"Try using Details. It has the option to account for the full duration of the fight, including player inactivity, whereas Recount (and I think Skada) do not. ",wow
11164,I love rogue's wrathful gladiator and i see no one using it. Maybe i'm biased because i spent so much time trying to get it.,wow
11172,"There is a way to catch your skills up, but it's expensive. It's like the matrix, you inject skill points into your skull. You can buy the injectors on the marketplace. 

The learning curve is what will get you. Or goons.",wow
11246,Used to play with/duel Hoff all the time back when he was still on Lightning's Blade. Super nice dude. ,wow
11247,Sorry I did not get a better shot of this now. I did not know so many people would enjoy it as much as I did. Next time I will do better reddit. &lt;3,wow
11262,It's times like this that I wish I had even a small amount of artistic talent.,wow
11272,"Personally in my SSM match our strat was to keep rotating with 5/6 ghosting the cart we already have. That honestly made the game into an actual ""brawl"" and my goodness that was the most fun I've had in a BG.",wow
11349,Maybe because I'm female and I want a character that looks like me Plus I like to transmog a Lot!,wow
11362,"What are they claiming you are being banned for?  They should have told you the reason.

They also virtually never start out with a six month ban.  Were you given any warnings previously about actions you were doing to include your account being suspended for a few days?

There is a lot you're leaving out that could shed a lot of light on the situation.

If you're streaming much of what you do, could someone have gotten your account information through your stream, and done something wrong without you knowing?",wow
11380,"Class design and the group mechanics during combat were different back then.

A clear focus on working with your group, not just next to them like now.

CC was important.  Adds could cause a wipe because aoe was not the monster it is now.

Today you just need to know your own role very well.  Understanding and fighting differently based on the difference in your healer's spec is rare now. In 95% of combat today, a healer is a healer regardless of spec or even class (and earlier, even race mattered: Dwarf Fear Ward).

Sheeping a patrolling add before he aggros is not a thing anymore because most classes will aoe and break all non stun cc anyways.  Most cc is only used in PvP or when the shit hits the fan and suddenly a rogue is forced to tank, and then vanish for a moment of respite while the hunter pet covers for a moment.

Aggro used to be a thing that needed to be managed by the dps.   Which is why aoe was rarely used like it is today.",wow
11392,"Firstly what ilvl is your rogue? I'm at 910 atm and having the 11% bonus is certainly nice in pvp. Also do you have your artifact maxed out to 52 traits? This gives you a LOT of stamina and afaik this still counts in pvp. I've only just got back into it but in terms of 2v2. /3v3 you always want to make sure you're opening with cc and applying cc as long as you can, I know that when I first started playing I always prioritised my combo points and energy onto damage abilities rather than cheap shot/full kidney shot. When bursting or going for kill you should pop blade dance/symbols of death/shadow blades for max dps and try and keep nightblade up at the start of your burst. Make sure you have the right talent set up for for both normal talents and honour talents as they have a huge impact on your pvp damage as the PvE talents are different to pvp. Apart from that just keep at it I'm sure you'll improve :) ",wow
11394,"tbh if you set your hearthstone to the shrine you dont really need this toy, you got all the portals you need right there. plus you got a portal to shrine in new dalaran",wow

11434,"It did cause wipes sometime ago because of a bug, technically it can never cause a wipe because it makes sure everyone is at same health percentage. 

For a raid to wipe under spirit link the damage would have to be more than everyone's health pools combined, which still wouldn't be spirit link's fault.",wow
11436,"Not a fan of ogres, also not a fan of how they did kargath in. He had such a huge impact on the invasion opening when you start the expac and then he was just a really easy first boss of the first raid? Kind of anti climactic after all that build up. En did kind of blow though, same issue with that one as I had with hfc: too much of one color gets really boring really fast. ",wow

11725,"You've got way too much haste.

If you run with In for the Kill(and you should), you onoy need 10% haste to fit Bladestorm and Ravager into your Battle Cry, **assuming** you have the Tier 20 4pc.

It depends at what gear level you are. Evenwithout 4pc your haste level is way too high. Get some more mastery and preferably versatility. Critisn't that bad without Anger Management and can actually sim quite high(relatively speaking).

11926,"The thing with WoD is that it lasted so long and had such a feeling of so much was left undone.  We go through the process of saving/taking a capital but instead we got shitty asharan replacements.  The zones were amazing, beautiful and had a good story but there was a limited number of them and so many of the enemies were the same, that plus some characters felt so under done like Ogrim.  The raids were good, except HFC wasn't as awesome as the first two and lasted for a whole fucking year.  Tannan was a great concept but it continued the you only fight orcs and again it lasted a way longer than it should have.  Garisons were okay but people have very widely spread opinions on them.  But they ended up with little variety and made the stand in a city and queue even worse.  That plus them giving such good rewards made the people who didn't like them or even if you did but just not today feel forced to do them.  WoD also gave us the new character models which certainly are good.  The content we got in WoD was good, but so much of it did feel like only part of a whole we never saw ",wow

11959,"I'm not sure why, but one night I decided to just take a break from the grind of gearing up in Legion and found myself wandering around. I somehow ended up in Mulgore and I remembered this NPC so I decided to see him. It brought back memories of when this just happened since I was more hardcore during TBC when this was current news.

Something about it just struck a cord, then I decided to read up on NPCs that were tributed to real life people. I decided to pay them visits as well, very somber evening. 

May Ezra Rest in Peace.",wow
11964,"Definitely. Funnily enough as someone who adores the RTS games especially Warcraft III; the main two things I wanted most out of WoW was the ""hidden isle"" of Pandaria (which was briefly mentioned) from where Chen and Mojo Stormstout hailed next to the follow-up of Arthas and his reign as Lich King after the end of the Frozen Throne to which both coincidentally turned out to be the most enjoyable expansions by far.

I gave Legion a shot and it was alright for under a month; fun to see Maiev and Illidan again (though I feel was forcibly rehashed) but unfortunately and a pity that I've moved on since.

Stay classy /r/wow, you guys are always fun to hang around for discussions compared to /r/ffxiv which is just downvote city so most voices aren't heard usually (elitism is strong over there).",wow
11995,"Cannot stress waiting on using your boost enough. Learn the game, take your time leveling, figure out if you like doing damage, healing your buddies, or tanking everything. I remember using my 90 boost when WoD dropped on a ranged dps class and I hated the play style (I like getting up close and personal) and now have a level 95 character I'll probably never play. ",wow
11999,"Aside from Samedi, Shango, Bwonsamdi, and Zanza, all of the troll loa from all of the troll cultures all appear to be animal spirits, which IMO heavily implies that they're Wild Gods (especially since certain loa from Zul'drak are explicitly referred to as gods and not loa).  

Trolls also consider wisps to be loa, despite the fact that they're not actually loa: they're the ghosts of dead Night Elves.  Chronicle Volume 1 states that ""Loa is the name given by trolls to the beings they worship, including some Wild Gods, spirits who have been a part of Azeroth since the ordering of the world.""  Considering how Night Elf ghosts clearly haven't been around since the ordering of the world, and that there are also no records of any mortal dying and ascending to loa-hood (coining the term now), it seems to indicate that any return by Vol'jin would technically be a ghost/spirit and not a true loa, regardless of what the trolls call him.",wow

Personally, I still have a blast playing my ele shaman, I do good DPS and get invited to a number of raids (albeit normal mode t11 stuff, but hey, I have fun) so I don't really care if they didn't take any of my class. But the game is there for all sorts of folks.",wow

BoH had a most important thing aside from stats: weapon maximal damage. What it lacked in strength, it gained in the range of raw damage the weapon could pull out.

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*! 

**Okay, so how do I start?**

13716,"I try and prioritize RL as well, so I don't farm nearly as much as I should for legendary chance, but here is what I do and I end up with a legendary every 2-3 weeks:

Emissary quests everyday + 4 Broken Shore dailies so I can guarantee 1 turn in there as well (Order Hall quests can give bonus turn ins over time too) and then the weekly raid with the group.  No LFR, and no additional raids.  Occasionally I'd try and get a M+ of some kind done, though would not always get the highest one.  This does still require about an hour each night to get things done.  A bit more one night (or on the weekend) to do the M+.  If you have additional time on the weekends, it's easy to find a Heroic EN group and blow through that place in 30 minutes just to up your legendary drop chance.  Anything beyond that I would consider overkill for myself, but there are certainly plenty of other things you could do to try and farm those legendaries.

I would agree that there is a bit of a tacit understanding that those who are behind should put in a bit of extra effort  to keep up.  Your DPS numbers are not bad for the content, but our equivalent ilvl DPS are pulling 900k-1mil DPS pretty consistently, so that may have something to do with your guild issues.  I know Ret is very reliant on ideal legendaries, so that may be something you should focus more on, but I completely understand how soul crushing that can be.

I think overall the guild is just not a good fit for you.  As a busy adult, it can be very hard to find a good guild that fits your schedule and understands your priorities.  It sounds like you and the guild just aren't quite on the same page.",wow
13724,You can't just mount a different version? Paladins have full use of all four versions.,wow
13728,"Why was permanently banning Swifty rather than actually warning him or temporarily suspending him a bad idea? Well:

* He has hundreds, perhaps even thousands of active fanboy followers that would literally suck his cock if he asked them to.
* He is a popular, well known player.
* It was Zybak who apparently egged on the spamming that eventually did crash the servers.
* Blizzard gave no warning. They just permabanned him.
* Only three servers crashed. Pissing off mindless fanboys who can just gang up and take down other servers as a protest towards Swifty's case is going to make their move less cost-effective.",wow

Once you reach about 880-890 que for every nighthold run you can. You'll get in one eventually. It took me about a week to get 900 and about 3 to join a guild (6/10m at the time) and fix my stat priority. Now I am 920ilvl, 9/9 H starting M today, and top3 dps.

I myself tend to play for a few months and then quit - I wouldn't really worry about missing out on content because you'll have plenty of time to experience it later on, although if you're a serious raider or pvper, then of course it's a little different. The most important thing is, however, to keep in mind that it's just a game, don't sweat it. Taking breaks is healthy and probably good for your life outside WoW.",wow

Bgs yes they feel probably more balanced then ever before. In bgs I have lost and beaten every class one on one, good players stand out in all classes. Arenas are just cookie comps and flavors of the week. I felt WoD was very unbalanced toward affli locks and frost dk but I did like the gear and scaling seemed to make it more even as far as the gear side goes. I could play pvp casually and top tier raiders/pvpers did not have a rediculus gear advantage (once you got current season set). Yes I could not go into raids and smack dps charts but they also could not come into a bg and wreck every thing. Once a raider stepped into my world was more evenly matched.",wow

14076,"I wonder if the debuff you cleansed might have been the nature resistance green cauldron debuff in [ZG](http://icy-veins.com/zul-gurub-heroic-dungeon#sec22).  These appear as cleanse-able in Vuhdo, and I assume in healbot as well.  However, they are beneficial, not harmful.

On my resto shaman, I've cleared ZA and ZG roughly a dozen times each, and I'm well geared for normal raiding. Amusingly enough I got kicked last night by an awful group that was looking for a scapegoat for their standing-in-fire, unable-to-cc incompetence.  It happens, don't take it personally.

But my best advice is to run new content with guildies a few times, before getting into pugs.

&gt;""In *Tides of Darkness*, the Light was used for interrogation purpose by making someone to tell all they know, although the subject moved to immense grief afterwards.""

This seems to indicate that Light is capable of forcing a change, be it either physical or psychological.

There is also the case of Avrus Illwhisper, a satyr in Ashenvale, who wished to seek redemption from Elune and was ""blessed"" by Elune and restored to his true Kal'dorei form.  Being that Elune is an entity commonly associated with Light (priests, ""Light of Elune,"" Ysera's ascension), and combined with the aforementioned Lothraxion example, it seems to definitely indicate that the Light can indeed force, or ""allow"" a physical change.",wow

14571,"Wow, since battle pets got added later in the game I never realized how confusing this must be to a new hunter!

I think most other posts here probably answer your question but to put it in a bit more depth. The battle pet page is a collections page for little vanity pets that don't help your character fight. It's not hunter exclusive, and they're the critters you see in the world. At first they just existed as a fun little familiar following you around and being cute, but eventually they decided to essentially add pokemon into the game by making it so those little vanity pets could level up and fight each other (but still be meaningless in normal combat). Now some critters have a green paw mark above their names (and they show up on the mini map), that indicates it's a pet you could fight with your vanity pets and possibly capture for your own. There's different rarities and each one can get up to level 25. You choose a team of up to 3 pets and each has 3 different abilities you can use in combat (each ability slot has two options at max level) and it's a turn based fight much like pokemon. The vanity pets are saved account wide on all characters, just like your mounts you will eventually get.

In contrast, the pets you tame as a hunter are your companions for questing and actual fighting on your character. They're mobs that actually pose a threat to you, normally (critters fall over dead if you so much as look at them). You can manage them with stable masters in cities where you can stash your pets and take out different ones. It's a pretty fun part of being a hunter, and eventually you can get rare pets that have special abilities (like there's one that can bring people back to life if they die in combat).",wow

I've only done the first 4 bosses of tomb on heroic and I've cleared normal tomb twice. 

I just wasn't too picky about groups and on weekends there would be groups that said AP farm or ""viewer raid"" and I would just apply and usually they could get past the first few bosses and there would be people higher ilvl then me I would just ask if they needed drops.

Inside the guild housing could be a guild only auction house, food vendors similar to the carts in MoP, portals to certain areas in the world (which your guild can unlock by getting certain achievements for each zone), and perhaps even a really hard to unlock item which functions as a placeable portal location, which then anyone in the guild can use to teleport to that specific place (if it were a gold making guild, then you could put it outside an old raid or dungeon perhaps, if it's a raiding guild then it could lead to the raid, if it's a rp guild it could lead to your ideal RP location).

WoW is not D3. It's loot should not resemble D3. Because you cannot farm WoW the same way you farm D3.

Didn't get the leggos you wanted in WoW? Well you need to get a group of 5 God damn people on their game to go do mythic dungeons, all of which take an entire fucking half hour each. And you probably won't even get any loot from half of them.

Though the only reasonable answer is, it's an MMO, it has social aspects written in the tag used to describe the genre. Join a good mythic raiding guild that takes socials and hope you get to prove yourself on maybe an alt run, or just ask in guildchat if people want to join you. 

I'm saying that because I raidlead a mythic raiding team and we bring socials on our altruns or just pugs that people in the team randomly host. I always have players that are hungry to do content and are very versatile in role(Dps players who can heal, tank.

18227,"I don't really know much about shadowpriests, but I've looked a bit at logs for you and the top people for your ilvl. 

First of all, your opener is a bit different from others. It seems opening with Vampiric Touch (start casting before pull so it casts right as the boss is pulled) then Shadow word pain into double mind blast and then double mind flay. But that might because of procs from trinkets or similar. 

The glaring issue though is that  you're casting less of everything than people with same ilvl. Either you haven't learned how to stagger your movement to cause as little downtime as possible, or you have too little haste. (or maybe even you just sit still and don't cast anything here and there, but I don't think that's the case) 

For example on Gorgoth you did 40 mindblasts vs a top logs 63, and his fight was shorter than yours. On that note your mind blast damage did a lesser % of your total damage than it did for him as well, (6% vs 15% roughly), so here's probably the case of prioritizing wrong abilities. 

It's not too easy for me to see what you do wrong because I don't know how abilities interact and what is RNG and similar, but for you I think it would be very interesting to pick someone around the best in the world (for your ilvl) and see how they play then go back and see how you played the same fight. 

https://howtopriest.com/viewtopic.php?f=36&amp;t=9804 interesting forum post about haste. 

Another thing I noticed was that you spent a lot less time in Void Form than him. Possibly related to haste, but if you want to improve I suggest throwing away any notion that you're doing 250k less dps because of poor legendaries or other things out of your control.

Usually pulls are the best for it because there is always the 10 second window when the boss is doing absolutely nothing and you can tunnel dps. 

In multitarget you want to use it when you have the agony extender high as possible (max 35 sec duration). 

You need to plan ahead before using sh to make sure you got reap stacks and 3-4 soul shard ready when it comes off cooldown. 

On mythic progress there are some exceptions when to use it. Top priority add coming up which will rekt the offtank if it doesnt die fast enough? Save SH for that target.

I use SH 100% of the time over sinqularity in progression because the dps difference is minimal and with SH you nuke down prio targets when needed.

If you are running DE talent (execute) then you obviously wanna make sure you have SH available when the target hits the &lt;35% hp range.

Druid tanks are easy to learn a rotation with, gearing is pretty simple, and lately, Blizz has put in the 2 and 4 piece set bonuses something for bear tanks so now teir is a good option when in wrath it wasn't as much.  What was interesting to me was 2 items that were the same item level, One was a rogue cloak, and the other was a tanking cloak with dodge on it.  The Rogue cloak actually offered more dodge % from the agility than the typical tank cloak with dodge on it.  So thats one thing to take into consideration.

19536,"My Dwarven Shaman, Volkh, apprenticed as a jewelcrafter in Ironforge as a young adult. He was a natural, and seemed to be able to coax the best gems from ore and  shape them with ease. 

Then the Third War broke out, and he went to join the Alliance. He was not yet an adult and was too young to fight, but assisted his brethren in various ways - cooking, first aid, repairing armor, etc. One of the Wildhammer gryphon riders noticed him and sensed a potential within him. He talked to Volkh and told him that in Aerie Peak were dwarves that could teach him how speak with the elements and serve a greater purpose.

After the war, Volkh went to Aerie Peak with the Wildhammer to study and learn their shaman traditions. Ten years later, after Deathwing attacked Azeroth, he had completed his training as a Shaman and returned to assist the Ironforge and the Alliance, and Azeroth itself. He has continued in his craft as a jewelcrafter, mostly as a hobby, but has learned that he was using the elements to coax the gems from the rock naturally.

As Wrathion explained, he knew nothing about the attack and was simply visiting Northrend for ""[his] own amusement"", but was surprised to see a demonic infestation at the Obsidian Dragonshrine. He reminded Chromie and the adventurer that if they were looking for someone who might take umbrage at a dragon, they should start with the undead and whoever was controlling them.

22089,"I just want to point out [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/6os1vb/pve_tuning_changes_for_june_25/dkk4pxk/) comment from two days ago.

&gt;Only windwalkers if you wanna say they don't have a single better DPS spec, going ONLY by DPS, but really there are a lot of classes worse off all things considered.

&gt;Feral Druids are still not very good and telling them to play boomkin is basically like telling them to reroll. They want to play a melee spec, not a ranged. Oh and survival hunters because they still exist.

&gt;Then you have DK's/Enhancement shamans who do similar damage to rets, maybe 45k-80k more ST according to WCL Mythic Goroth at Max Percentile, but have far less utility and no immunity, which is obviously super important this tier.

&gt;When you take all that stuff into consideration, rets are actually the 3rd best melee DPS, only to be outdone by warriors and rogues, that both just got nerfed. No good guild cares about a DPS margin that small when you bring so much more to the raid. If it's a choice between a ret vs warrior/rogue (before these nerfs) then yeah okay maybe the ret is benched. Ret vs. any other melee? Ret probably gets the raid spot.

&gt;Source: In a top 60 world 7/9M guild, already been benched for avatar (ret is benched too) and will be for KJ as well (ret won't be benched). Also, our ret was slotted for our mistress progress kill when I wasn't and would have been in for maiden too if he wasn't sick because tanks deaths are a thing on that fight, kings can be helpful, and rets do a ton more damage when they stack their damage CD's with the maiden buffs than most other melee classes.

&gt;TLDR: Ret's aren't really that bad.

&gt;Edit: Forgot about Havoc, but Havoc isn't very good either. They only really shine on maiden because they just hold their burst CD's for when they have the maiden buff and do insane damage. Otherwise their damage generally is lower than most melee and the only thing they have going for them is they can cheese some stuff with netherwalk.

Though, with all the feedback I've been getting, I'll probably make a second edition, and this will definitely be remedied there. 

Though, for reference here, orange/gray and purple/gray generally suggest a missing encounter specific legendary, or DPS loss windows due to mechanics. 

Blue or green and gray would say more toward trinkets, artifact relics, and perhaps missing a more general legendary. 

For green &amp; gray it is also possible there is a rotational issue. 

Gray/gray would likely indicate a combination of gear simply being low, talent build issues, or again, rotation issues. 

Generally speaking, given reasonable item level and itemization, all classes should be able to get green/green with practice.

I'm not talking about damage output or relative strength to other legendaries. Read what I'm actually saying.

Arms' rotation is clunky, boring, and simple. You hit CS. You hit MS. You spam WW until CS is up again. If MS is up and tactician hasn't procc'd, you use artifact ability in place of CS. Repeat until execute phase. It's literally 3 buttons 99% of the time.

The ring proc actually gave you options and some dynamics to the rotation. Execute becoming available meant you had choices to make. More importantly, it meant you had something to do between CS procs besides spamming one ability over and over. 

Damage or usefulness of arms warriors aside, nerfing the proc rate specifically is just a straight nerf to how fun the spec is to play.

I'm not sure where you were seeing this. RoC it was because Tyrande asked him to, as well as the prospect of gaining more power. TFT was because KJ coerced him into destroying LK, or face destruction himself. The novels have shown how power hungry Illidan was, as well as his own magic addiction. Let's not forget how half the time he was trying to impress Tyrande.         
        
&gt; his ultimate goal was to save Azeroth.         
       
Again, he uses this to justify his actions, while what he does is out of self-preservation.          
            
&gt; He's, win-at-all-costs kind of a guy        
       
For his own interests, yes. Nothing more.            
            
&gt; a chaotic good.         
         
He's more chaotic neutral.                  
                 
&gt; The retcon served the purpose of putting TBC Illidan in line with his previous personality and goals and they did it masterfully.                 
           
No, the retcon served the purpose of bringing Illidan back, while preying on the nostalgia people have for him. This is in no way his previous personality, and a cheap sell out.         ",wow

24891,"**[H][EU][Twisting Nether] &lt;Battle Scars&gt;** is a friendly, semi-casual raiding guild on Twisting Nether created by players with high-level, hardcore raiding experience from previous expansions. Instead of treating players like numbers on a meter, our guild prioritizes having fun during progression by recruiting players with a sense of humor and a positive attitude who are interested, first and foremost, in being a part of a friendly community where everyone can feel at home.  
  
**Environment**  
We enjoy weekly guild activities such as speed runs of farm content (Emerald Nightmare, Trial of Valor, and The Nighthold) where we gear our new players and alt characters and Mythic+ pushes to ensure that everyone has a chance to get a +15 run for the week. Our members are very active and social in game and we have a Discord channel to communicate out of game. If you are looking for a calm, peaceful place to focus on progression while enjoying the company of your fellow guild members, this is the place for you!  
  
**Recruiting**  
We are currently openly recruiting the listed classes and specializations for our Core Raider team. In addition, we are always openly recruiting all classes and specializations for our casual raiding team as well as social players who would like to be a part of our friendly community.  
  
* Death Knight (DPS Spec) - High  
* Mage (Any Spec) - High  
* Paladin (Retribution) - Medium  
* Rogue (Any Spec) - High  
* Shaman (Elemental) - High  
  
**Raiding**  
Battle Scars was formed half-way into The Nighthold raid tier. After developing our raid team, we ended Nighthold with 4/10 Mythic kills and look forward to progressing even further in Tomb of Sargeras where we have been able to advance into a new tier together as a team. Our current progression in Tomb of Sargeras is 7/9 Heroic.  
  
For continuing Tomb of Sargeras progression and looking forward towards the Antorus raid, we will be raiding three days per week (Thursday, Sunday, and Monday from 7:30pm to 10:30pm server time). We also have raids for the Normal level of the current tier on Wednesday that are mandatory at the beginning of the tier and change to optional after the first month.  
  
While we pride ourselves on our friendly community and non-toxic raiding environment, we do expect all members of our raiding team to come fully prepared and focused to our raids. We are able to create this unique environment by respecting our fellow raid members and the time, effort, and dedication that every other member of our team is putting in each day. As such, we prefer players who are excited about raiding and look forward to learning and working to progress through new content.  
  
**Contact**  
If you are interested in joining our community, please feel free to contact Branches or Joséphines in game. I can also be reached on BattleTag at Branches#21688 or via Discord at Branches#0460. Joséphines can also be reached via Discord at Jo (Joséphines)#4873. We look forward to hearing from you!  ",wow

No silence/deterrence/nothing, just pure ignorance and spamming tame at this point. 

Finally, the tame cast bar starts to actually move, hes getting closer, cast bar almost full, hes even closer and still has like 1/3rd of his HP left, he's right on top of me and....... he's dead. Lying on the ground beside me, dead, is my new pet spider, where a moment before was a ginormous spider w millions of HP left.

25355,"Randomized mechanics and other players (the former especially) just fall under the predefined strategy thing to me. Like, if this random thing happens, we need to make sure we do this. These team members are responsible for this, if they die, this is what we need to do.

I disagree FPS games lack strategy, but I don't feel up to arguing that at the moment, I'm going to bed soon.

I also disagree that FPS' stay the same as you put more time in. As you put more time in, your mechanical skills and strategy improve, and it's more challenging because the same is true of your opponents if you play ranked.

I understand what you're saying though, maybe I'm just incapable of understanding why WoW progression is satisfying to him. Humans are pretty complex. ",wow

Pvp this expac works off of stat templates applied to your character in instanced settings, this gives the pvp devs a better way to tune damage, but this system is on not enabled for world pvp content.

Now you maybe wondering, what does have that to do with your problem? Well, when wod eventually came out, I was not given the title, nor the achievement, what I did was send a ticket to blizz, they replied they   couldn't do nothing about it, I had also submitted screenshots, but nothing, they would say that I had not completed the quest and couldn't obtain the title (which was bullshit because I did)  so I kept sending tickets demanding to be given what I had worked so hard to get, and by expressing my disappointment for how that situation was developing. After 1 or 2 weeks, can't remember, I logged into warlock to find that I was given the achievement and the title. 
My advice to you is to keep sending tickets (no spamming ofc), demand to talk with another GM someone superior I mean,the situation you got into is not only unfair but also ridiculous, but remember not to lose your cool, always be polite.

25693,"&gt; 3 - This is biggest problem, Crusade. Crusade is the best CD in the game, by far (as confirmed by blizz) outside of crusade ret is basically useless so if anything happens during crusade which requires you to stop hitting the boss (meteor on goroth, gladiator kiting on harjatan etc etc) even for 5/6 seconds you lose a massive amount of dps.
&gt; 

As far as mythic raiding goes, I'd rather deal with our ret doing slightly less damage than another spec than lose his utility right now.  Wisdom is crazy good.  Bubble is an immunity which is very, very important atm.  Bop works on a variety of mechanics including hydra shot and Armageddon.

25734,"Flurry -&gt; Ice Lance -&gt; Shimmer (towards boss) -&gt; Ice Lance.

I believe the minimum is around 60% haste possible slightly less if the stars align. The closer to the boss you are the less haste you need. It also depends on some other stuff like the bosses model size and if you run towards the boss during the combo so practice makes perfect. To do it with minimal haste you want to run forward during the combo, blink directly towards the boss, and cast the second ice lance from basically on top of the boss so it has minimum travel time.

You can use this weakaura to see if you hit the double or not so if you're willing to spend a little time practicing on different bosses and target dummies you'll get a good feel for it. https://www.altered-time.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=3917

In truth though it's pretty unusual that it's worth doing - it's still a dps increase but it's not a huge one anymore. In general I'd reccomend saving your shimmer charges to deal with mechanics. You'll often gain the dps back by having shimmer so you don't interrupt your rotation to deal with mechanics.

edit: for what it's worth you can go flurry -&gt; shimmer -&gt; ice lance -&gt; ice lance. The order makes no difference it just matters where you are when you cast the flurry compared to where you are when you cast the second ice lance. The further you've moved towards the boss during the combo the less haste you'll need.",wow

I have about five or six legendaries in my bag at all times, and then one or two that I bring out for M+ affixes that annoy me.    With teeming coming up, I am going to use a defensive legendary, and an AoE one, then switch it out right before a boss fight.

I am not sure why people don't switch out their legendaries in M+ runs, you just setup different sets, label them properly, and change out before/after every fight.

As a random example:  I will kill a boss, then put on my ghost wolf boots while I run to the next mobs, then switch back to my next set, and so on.  It might just be because I am trying to push higher every week into M+ stuff, but it is a lot of fun figuring out the best combos to shave seconds off.",wow

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*! 

**Okay, so how do I start?**

26239,"Joined a guild in November.  First expansion that I tried to start raiding ( only did PvP before that). Got put into the main raiding team together with 2 IRL friends. All goes well and we clear mythic EN. When Nighthold mythic started our two raid leaders decide to take a break from the game. We still had about 4 other officers but none of them were really capable of leading a 20 man team. So we stick a bit to heroic raiding.

I create a website for them, then start making spreadsheets for tracking our performance per member, host a team speak server, which eventually went to Discord because its way better. Set up the complete Discord server. So after a while they ask my IRL friend and me to become officer and lead our team to some mythic kills again. 
So we eventually get to 7/10 mythic, to our lovely strarbro. 

Then out of the blue my IRL friend starts spreading rumours about me wanting to realm transfer because our guild would never be able to 10/10 Night hold. In 1 night the guild owner demotes me to social. I try to get an explanation for what is happening but I don't get any answers and I should just deal with it. I left the guild the next day. It felt like all of the work I had done was destroyed over one night. 

Multiple other guild members also left because they didn't see any future in the guild anymore without me raidleading. Our main tank and 1 healer left, crippling the mythic team. I'm actually kind of happy they haven't cleared ToS heroic yet.

26374,I was just thinking about this the other day and wondered why they increase the level caps with every expansion so as to completely destroy any reason to explore previously made content.  I started with WotLK and I at least got to do BRD and LBRS before I was at too high of a level to finish with the vanilla end game content but did none of the raids.  In outland I leveled even faster and didn't even touch TBC's endgame content or raids and know almost none of the story line behind that expansion.  I got to level 80 just before this last expansion so needless to say I've missed out on most of the WotLK heroics and the ones I did get involved with were at level 85 and somewhat faceroll.  And it's not like now that I have a couple of 85's I've abandoned them because they don't level anymore.  I have been grinding away in new zones and heroics trying to get enough vp and rep to buy some cool gear.  I can't say that I wouldn't try any less if the gear I was looking for made just a little bit of difference either (which is sometimes the case even though the item level difference is huge).  I understand there is a timeline to WoW and I entered in pretty late but I wish there was a way to do those old raids and instances in a way that is actually difficult and meaningful.,wow

2. Monks were also half-assed into the world. All you need is a place to get a board, and some weapon, the rest of the order hall could just be skipped maybe?

3. I don't even know what class they would add anymore. Anything added would have to be legitimately new, which would fit as a hero class much more then a normal class.

Replacing old hardware meant about a year of doing frenzied visits to sites to pull out all the machines that were not up to spec for win7. And yes, I know, we could have gone to 8 or 10, but part of the problem is how long it takes to get something certified for use.

Yes, you would not be playing WoW on those machines, but they're a case where XP was still in use right to the end of its longest support term because of budget issues.",wow
26961,"A lot of boobs responding in here. While I'm not cutting edge healer, I'm in a world 500 guild and regularly hit 90%+ parses on progression. Not to brag, but to say I know how the class handles a bit more than the average healer.

Ok, bragging over. While this tier still getting sorted, its looking like we are the go to for stacked damage recovery moreso than other classes thanks to 4 piece. Which is a first. Normally people say we are because that's the only viable style. And then other classes just obliterate us at stacked healing anyway and still have other healing viable uses. (Druid movement)

The idea that we are the best oh poop healer thanks to mastery is a myth that I wish would just die already. That doesn't exist for progression largely.  Maybe in easy mode farm where your are cheese healing or very outgeared lower tier guilds. Shaman is tuned around those oh poop moments and raids are tuned so tight than any oh poop moment is a wipe 99% of the time regardless of the number of shaman you stack. What we do have is tons of CDs that keep us in the fight for inclusion. Namely totem of guaranteed raid slot (SLT) and totem of mechanic cheese (reincarnate).  Combined with htt, AG, weapon and velens complimenting them all. We carry CDs to deal with more mechanics than any other healer. That is our strength. Not mastery. Mastery is just part of the deal. And isn't even our best stat this tier for hps. Haste is. 

Edit to reply to a boob who deleted his comment on why haste.

Parse your stats dude. Haste top dog thanks to hr changes this tier. 

What you're going to see is mastery and Crit stagnate at current acceptable levels and haste creep up with gear. HR and haste go together very well. Which queens has jack impact on.",wow

27239,"Are you unable to complete the M9+ in the Time Limit, or at all? 

If you are unable to complete it at all, identify the problems. If there are particularly nasty trash packs you cannot seem to get through (HoV comes to mind), consider running comps with reliable CC. Mages and rogues are particularly useful in this endeavor, as polymorphing and sapping one mob in a crowd can easily be the difference between moving on, or wiping there. 
If you are not able to progress past specific bosses, once again, identify the problems. Are important casts going off? Bring groups who can interrupt. Are you running into enrage timers? Bring better DPS. Are you unable to heal through certain mechanics? Bring groups who know fights and can avoid unnecessary damage. 

If you are simply unable to beat the dungeon under time, keep three things in mind. If you are losing time to deaths, chances are the tank cannot hold aggro, or you can't keep his HP up. Both are consequences of affixes (Skittish, bursting...) that are nasty, and target healers and tanks more than DPS. If you aren't dying often but are just moving slowly, then you can solve it in two ways. More confident tanks, or slightly easier to find, better DPS. Aim for 750k+ DPS when forming groups, regardless of item level (within reason). I've cleared a 12+ with about that DPS and we had a little breathing time. Lastly, different dungeons have differently levels of difficulty. Attempting to beat a 9+ MoS, or VoW, will be much easier than Upper Kara or HoV (in my opinion). Don't take it personally and try to remain upbeat if you don't beat the timer -- the specific dungeon + affix combo can be very nasty!  ",wow

27410,"What? No not really. I don't know many people who expect tough challenging dungeons at early levels, but okay... So let's say we put more emphasis on mechanics in low level dungeons... Well heirloom gear is going to hard-scale anyway and still make the content easier by a mile... now say we buff said bosses or mobs to fit the damage that heirlooms push out... Well now you've alienated those who don't use heirlooms and their contribution still means little to nothing.

So really, if someone wants to just level ... I mean do quests until you get quests for said dungeon, do the dungeon and don't touch LFD tool until you get another quest for those dungeons.

There's no other solution to this problem because heirlooms will always trivialize older content. Wiping on content that is supposed to be helping you level isn't fun. It's wasted exp and time, even for a newer player.

Also ... I think it's safe to assume as a general rule of thumb that every expansion from now on is going to have a boost ten levels below current max, so if they want to experience the same content that everyone else is then it's easy enough to use the boost.

27688,"Sigil of Misery, Sigil of Silence and if you're a blood elf - arcane torrent are the ways to deal with them. Play with Quickened Sigils and pop one just before they finish their cast (and start channeling).

Most important of all - plan out everything before it happens. Download DBM Challenge mode - it has pretty accurate timers for abilities. Go out of Variss' pool 5-6 seconds before arcane adds are about to spawn so you can drop your debuff and reenter when they spawn. I did not know this at first but self healing *does* generate threat, go smack Variss with a Soul Cleave / Spirit Bomb and they will come to you.

Make some macros - button to focustarget Variss and one for Kruul and then Imprison/Consume magic macros that are cast on your focus target, regardless of your current target. I found myself getting killed by Mind Blasts while having high Decay stacks so I made a weakaura that tracks his cast so I can use my defensives or Imprison appropriately.

If you need more tips I would love to help.

Edit: Recalled some more things:

For the Kruul phase - use the focustarget macros to interrupt Twisted Reflections (if you don't make it grab an orb immediately or he will heal). Make/download a weakaura that tracks that and makes a sound (the airhorn works really well). I was usually double jumping, not gliding, most of the time to make it faster/easier to glide out of the fel pool when it does hit. It's not super big damage but a few millions could be useful to have.

Most important thing in Kruul phase (after proper mitigation of course) is abusing the fact that **Kruul can be imprisoned**. This does not fully negate an annihilate cast - it still happens shortly after he breaks free but it gives you some time.

CDs for Annihilation - Spikes on first, Spikes + Brand on second, Meta + Spikes on 3rd, Last Resort on 4th or just hope Kor'vas SOMEHOW manages to take aggro and eat a stack which does like 5% hp to her. It did happen to me on my successful pull (she technically ate the first one not the last) but I'm sure I would have done it eventually even without that.

I did it at 897ish ilvl with a 2pc T19 I believe with Sephuz and Kil'Jaeden's Burning Wish. That was before the Spirit Bomb fiasco though - I kinda wanna be able to retry it again and see if it's way easier with that.",wow

28055,"Why do all three warlock specs feel more fun than at the start to you?

We still have tedious mechanics through the board. Far too much RNG, ELT, Reap and demonic empowerment as boring but required maintenance buffs, random shards, all our (used to be baseline) movement/control spells are in the same talent row, all in all we still have too little influence on our performance and we're still bound to specific pets and are missing the baseline interrupt. (Also RIP grimoire of sac). 

Warlocks for me feel like they used to be great, then they had to be changed for whatever reason and now they try to revert the damage they did step by step back to where we started.

I feel basically the exact opposite as you do. I love legion for the general content but I get to hate the specs. Being accessible is absolutely ok. But in SO many cases depth was entirely substituted by RNG. 

Look at ele shamans, easy to learn, sure. The difference between a good and a great ele is RNG anyway. I still think static overload for example feels cool and looks cool. But once you're trying to be competitive you rely on a 10% chance. There's nothing ""hard"" to master about it. It's praying to the dice. Sure, there's still a difference between a bad and a good ele.. But it takes not that much time to go from a bad to a good understanding of the  spec and then you're looking at that wall.

Exactly the same situation with outlaw (RtB), arms (CS), enhance (SS), sin (BoT), destro (Mastery/Shards), havoc (Fury gen) etc. 

Also all fluff was pruned from the classes for exactly no reasons. Maybe stuff like scare beast had to go because new players or whatever, but what about ""fancy skills"" like eye of the beast that did nothing but being immersive? Removing them was simply removing a part of the fun. As someone who PvPs a lot the homogenization and the simplificated toolkits were a damn hard hit for the game mode. I'm feeling like most games I play are on autopilot, with less interactions I can make my decisionmaking simply isn't that skill dependent. I play my PvE rotation and wait for the right time to drop a CC/CD. Rest of my performance is decided by factors I can't control and the ever swinging balance-pendulum.

I'm happy for you that you have fun with the classes. Again, the easy to learn part is a thing I also absolutely welcome. The bad thing is that the ""hard to master""-part is mostly missing and subsitituted by things we have little to no control about. Taking away skill ceilings and replacing them by RNG is a thing that they'll hopefully get rid of in the future.

Personally class design is the one single worst point of legion for me.

Its my first time posting here. I feel like I'm a little lost with my H Pally atm. I've just gotten back into the game after a long break (raided back in MoP up to Mythic Malkorok). I'm 'ok' with healing but lately my team has been bringing in another Holy Pally with a lower ilvl and he is outclassing me on most fights. I'm not concerned with numbers or topping charts. My thing is if my group is alive at the end then healing was ok, but I am curious if I could be doing something better. I noticed that I took more ""traditional"" raiding talents and the other h pally was taking more of a dungeon setup. That may be why he performed better, but I'm not sure.

Also, did the account had legion before it got hacked? Any meaningful characters (no a lvl 45 hunter is not a meaningful character). It might be easier to start anew.

Edit: before I get bashed away, I was banned for 2 years for selling feliron ore to a level 1 character in Ironforge. Who knew trading was considered botting!

Like sure I could bring only healers and tanks and do like a 2 hour fight but it does not guarantee anything. Would you want to spend all raid night fighting 1 boss for 2 hours straight? Or would you want to spend like 10-15 minutes with dps? Why force every fight to always have the EXACT same type of dps check as every other boss in the instance? What is the actual point of having the EXACT same thing on every boss?

Secondly simcraft doesn't tell you what you need it tells you how your stats are weighted. Just because haste is your best stat doesn't mean you don't need more mastery. 

Furthermore the talents you are running effect the value of stats a good amount. If you're running MG SC crit and mastery gain value on single target. If you're running WiA SL haste and mastery gain value on cleave. In a perfect world  for an aff lock though you want around 16-20% crit 18-22% haste and 110-130%mastery ",wow

Assassination is easy in the sense that you do the opener and then just basically keep everything up while pairing a certain few things together given the opportunity.",wow

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*! 

**Okay, so how do I start?**

I was very disappointed to summon my cool bird mount, only to be limited to hopping in Dalaran.",wow
30846,And I thought  Havoc Demon Hunter was the easiest class to play.,wow
30849,Oh i think i forgot about Panda cause i played it so little...i think all expansions had their thrill but i liked cata and Legion the most so far. Firelands is still my favorite raid. Vanilla and TBC is glorified by most because we were so young at that time i guess. I dont know why the younger me had fun doing endless grinds (some people say Legion is grindy but they dont remember farming weeks to move a little faster :D) but it did not feel as bad at the time as it does now when my hearthstone has 4minutes CD remaining.,wow
30856,"Jump on in!  The water's fine!  Everyone is giving you great advice here, so I won't reiterate it all, but I just want to say that this expansion is a ton of fun, there's lots of catchup mechanisms to get you rolling, and its super easy these days to find a group and/or guild for group content.  Leave your current guild and browse the /r/wowguilds or post what you're looking for-- you'll get at least a couple of responses.  Guilds are ALWAYS recruiting, and you can always join a more casual/chill guild to hang out with until you're ready for more serious raiding.

I get your anxiety about letting people down, but trust me, when you make a mistake in raid/dungeons (and we all do), you are not the first person to ever make that mistake.  In fact, you're already leaps and bounds ahead of others who make that mistake because you seem like you're concerned about playing well and will try to fix that mistake on the next run.  And if you run into any juvenile trolls who give you shit, ignore them and move on.  They don't matter.

This expansion is fun as hell-- get back in!",wow
30882,You're not wrong but I think whatever came of it would be too much like the first part of the expansion; there's only so much you can really do with the Sha.,wow

31337,"As someone that burned out pretty hard in Legion and am pretty much just watching the WoW subreddit for 7.3 news/8.0 speculation (where I will undoubtedly return for 8.0 and POSSIBLY just to lore out on 7.3), it's definitely not my best xpac of all time.

I'd actually rank it as follows:
Wrath &gt; BC &gt; MoP &gt; Legion &gt; Cata &gt; WoD.

I have a LOT of complaints about Legion -- faux content (7.2, anyone?), raid tuning/quality (Nighthold got stale really fast after the lukewarmness that was Emerald Nightmare), difficulty of alts, over-reliance on RNG to artificially lengthen content, the mid expansion class reworks/radical balance tuning, the gutting of the classes/bland gameplay. 

Legion was ALMOST a great expansion for me, but especially after (and not to shamelessly plug another game) playing another particular MMO's latest expac, Legion just doesn't compare. The writing is better, encounter design (so far) is better, class changes are better, PvP is even better. It's frustrating because Legion has WildStar syndrome for me -- it was 93% a great expansion pack but the 7% that was bad was so relentlessly bad, so unyieldingly it just killed all interest in playing for now.

That being said, I've been playing WoW since 2004, I am sure I will be playing again in 2018, and there's still a decent chance I wind up resubbing just to do the lore content (and LFR) on Argus before I AFK until 8.0. ",wow

32310,"I'm going to explain to you why ret is pretty bad, there are a few things to consider.

1 - Retribution buff uptime, 20% extra damage when someone dies, when people learn the fights etc the uptime of this buff will drop drastically, if you check the top pala logs most have a large amount of up time on this buff.

2 - Poor mobility, every other mele (expect DKs) have pretty good movement, however as a pala you need to spec into have good movement, which generally is a bad option as Divine intervention is such a powerful talent for 2 reasons its lets you basically get a free death and secondly reduces the CD of bubble, so you can cheese certain things ie during sisters Mythic i bubble'd the moonbeam off.

3 - This is biggest problem, Crusade. Crusade is the best CD in the game, by far (as confirmed by blizz) outside of crusade ret is basically useless so if anything happens during crusade which requires you to stop hitting the boss (meteor on goroth, gladiator kiting on harjatan etc etc) even for 5/6 seconds you lose a massive amount of dps. 

TLDR - Ret is bad, but only needs small buffs and damage redistribution away from crusade.",wow

It's coming to a point where blizzard seems to be losing their passion for the game, the flaws in the raid tier seems atypical of what blizzard normally produces. I hope they don't, its not healthy for a game if the devs just see it as a money factory. 

At least now since blizzard sees the fruits of rng everything and grinding to no end, things will look better next expac.

* Not all alone by yourself

* Phasing to still keep some things unique to you

* No free automatic resources, only from quests or turn-ins. This was a problem with WoD, because people feel sort of obligated to check in on their old garrison which is another reason for the gold nerf.

As for Artifacts, I wouldn't be surprised if they just jumped ahead to a player side Paragon system like in Diablo 3. People love a way to continuously get incremental upgrades to their character that they can grind, without necessarily needing to do raids.

The Trait system pre-Legionfall actually offers a path back to the old Talent Trees. Blizz doesn't mind the illusion of choice. We could have Talent Trees as long as everyone ends up in the same place eventually.",wow
32698,"1. Whatever gets the boss dead is ok. I'd say, though, for super casual normal, if you're pulling under 600k dps on single target fights then you've got some issues, in your gear, talent, rotations, etc. Get up around 700k and you'll probably stop catching criticism.

2. 86.5% cap on mastery, I think. A mastery proc on elemental blast gives 13.5% mastery, and any mastery past 100% is pointless, as our mastery skill can't proc twice off of the same cast. Your mastery isn't bad. Better than mine I think and I'm up around 915 ilvl. That cap can be really hard to reach, and if you do, you've probably gone too low in crit.

The Lich King is this evil dude that kills people and raises the dead,  so you have to kill him, okay? There's more depth to the plot for those who want it- but it's incredibly accessible. I think this was a huge selling point of the game.

I mean who plays Legion? It's vastly the same people who have been playing since BC/WOTLK/Cata and are now in the mid 20s or so. And I level a lot of alts and I've talked to people who have tried to get into the game and it's always the same stuff. They put up with the dungeon leveling grind and get a gist of the prior expansions but then they get to the current one and they just don't really know what's going on. Suddenly they have to do quests but who the fuck is this Khadgar guy and where does the Burning Legion come from and why are we in the broken isles and why are these Demon Hunters even important to us?

If your RL is set on 2/4/14 and you are the 5th healer by virtue of a few hps then yes, that titanforged piece of kit can make all the difference in the world. I've seen it happen. 

I don't see how removing titanforged kit reduces character progression, unless you feel it's a good idea to encourage obsessive raid-spamming for a minimal upgrade? If someone obtains BiS in all the kit before the next expansion then maybe they **should** be taking a break for a week or two.

That guy was the best healer EVER.  True to his word, I didn't go down once.  They only relieved me of MT duty at.... fuck, it was either at Sulfuron or Majordomo, I honestly can't remember which.

On top of that most of these fights certainly require a specific number of immunities available in your roster, so rogues are sitting their with some of/the best soaking toolkit in the game and they also are probably the best DPS as well.

Yeah you could recruit other classes if you happen to find someone who is much above average but obviously your goal is to recruit good players no matter what class, and in that case you'd clearly want the better players of the better classes.

35251,"It's not a bad fake at all, but there are numerous inconsistencies with how blizzard does reveal trailers that lead me to say it's fake. Of course, never say never, so it could just be an incredibly early storyboard, but i find that unlikely.

For one thing, when blizzard introduces a new playable race, the backdrop is at least related to that race. In the cata trailer, goblins are revealed in The Lost Isles, and worgen in Gilneas. For MoP Pandaren were revealed to be playable in The Wandering Isle. Even the updated character models had a Frostfire Ridge backdrop.

They also tend to show animations for new races, not just a static preview of them standing around. 

Let's look at the first thing you see in this video. The forsaken ship looks identical to the one we already see in game (The Queen's Reprisal in Azsuna is a handy example). If Blizzard was truly giving us player ships, the reveal would be a more impressive, customized model, usually whichever is most finished (class halls were revealed with Paladin class hall because that was done first). I can't confirm because I don't play Alliance, but that boat looks like it could be in the game right now as well.

Speaking of the first thing you see, the text. It looks like they're trying to imitate the Legion font. But every reveal trailer has its own font. There's a distinct lack of polish to the font as well. Past trailer fonts have a sheen or a shadow to them, or both. They also tend to have a 3d effect to them.

Others have already pointed out the inconsistency of the name of ""Illidan's nagas"" and that it's a typo (nagas is not the plural of naga).

Perhaps the biggest sign to me that this is a fake is that every single reveal trailer Blizzard has done for a WoW expansion ends the same way, and this one does not.

A WoW Reveal trailer *always* ends with the new expansion's logo and name being revealed. Every single reveal has done this, even the BC one. Nothing else is ever revealed after the expansion logo, legion has links to other WoW videos but that's it. Similarly, when Blizz has a big villain behind an expansion they usually show them before the logo, or even just before it, but never after. Also when they're ready to show the big villain they *show* the villain, even if the model isn't ready (Deathwing was revealed with concept art).

The spirit Vol'jin is incredibly out of place. He would be earlier in the trailer if anywhere, but certainly not at the end.

So...yeah. Decent fake, but definitely fake, unless this is what the quality looks like in development, but i'm pretty sure the logo not being the final thing confirms this as fake.",wow

Last 3 guys that left or were asked to leave:

DK ,after a week in the guild, went into a rant of how the guild should be more helpful, he asked for help on his lower kara key at 10am on a weekday in the morning. People online at this time is usually doing some WQs before going to work. He left soon after to a more progressed guild, was booted from that guild after a week.

Hunter that apparently was a very very lonely dude, he required attention and something to do every time, he played overwatch, HotS and League with different guild members, he ended up leaving the guild to play black desert online full time because he met some people there that played more than us, sorry we cant play 24/7.

Priest guy that was a little bit under geared for my taste but was given a shot because he seemed like a decent player. First two weeks of Tomb he goes to every boss kill we do in normal and heroic as the average ilvl from our raid was 917 atm, he gets from 885 ilvl to 920 pretty easily, gets ""sat"" in the first night trying Mythic Goroth because as a healing officer i wanted to know if 4 healers were enough for this even though it doesn't have a enrage timer, got whispered a second after making the decision asking me what his standing in the guild was and that he is insecure if we are even gonna take him into Mythic, raid lead had to talk to him for a solid 15 minutes to explain the meaning of mythic raiding, having a good ""Comp"" and sometimes being sat for fights. Didnt last long after that.

The thing that blows my mind the most is when new recruits and trials complain and ask for gear on the first night they are brought in, like ""why did that guy got the piece if it was a better upgrade for me"" well because in the great scheme of things that piece was due to that guy because it completed his 2 set or his 4 set, allowed him to use a BiS legendary, many reasons, you just dont go and in your first week in a new job, ask for a raise.

There is a lot that the guild leadership has to take into account, if you are gearing to kill bosses sometimes an ilvl upgrade for someone is not a good reason to give them loot yet.

I hope you end up finding a guild that fits you, in this game finding a place that you can call home makes it more enjoyable but dont forget that the guys in charge are also people and that they can make mistakes and the best way to find a solution is to talk, find the officers share your thoughts in a good way if they are good and decent people they will hear you and even fix the problem that you are having, communication is the best thing you can have in a guild.

I would guess that Heroic Al'Akir had less than 16 days of actual dedicated progression on him by Paragon before the first kill. They most likely bashed their heads against him for a few hours and decided to go for lower hanging/more prestigious-looking fruit. 

The true holder of the title is Heroic Lich King- 42 days between Paragon's first Putricide kill and their first LK kill.

Richards Knakk who wrote most of them is simply not very good - creates a lot of Mary Sue-type characters and I find them slow and plodding.

Though I figure most people do this for all classes, binding your specific gear sets to actual keys so you can swap out of combat instantly helps a ton since most weeks you won't be able to chain pull. Depending on the dungeon (especially for tyrannical weeks) try running surrender if you have a brez in your group to maximize efficiency. I'd say you have to put a lot of work in for it to be good, but if you get good at it then spriest has no problem keeping up with other dps and your utility to soak abilities/mass really helps out your tank/healer depending on the week.

Arthas has defenders who look at that bad situation, decide he had no good options, and conclude that he did the right​ thing and therefore all his later crimes were the result of mind control or just bad writing.

Remember, Arthas had just encountered the Scourge plague earlier that day. Or maybe a couple days had gone by, but not many, and he still knew almost nothing about it. He hadn't tried having the plague healed, except maybe by the combat medic priest he happened to have with him - far from an expert. He hadn't tried imposing a quarantine. He hadn't had his mages do any research on necromancy. And when Uther and Jaina suggested ANYTHING other than slaughter, he disbanded Uther's entire order of paladins.

Instead of treating players like numbers on a meter, our guild prioritizes having fun during progression by recruiting players with a sense of humor and a positive attitude who are interested, first and foremost, in being a part of a friendly community where everyone can feel at home.  
  
**Environment**  
We enjoy weekly guild activities such as speed runs of farm content (Emerald Nightmare, Trial of Valor, and The Nighthold) where we gear our new players and alt characters and Mythic+ pushes to ensure that everyone has a chance to get a +15 run for the week. Our members are very active and social in game and we have a Discord channel to communicate out of game. If you are looking for a calm, peaceful place to focus on progression while enjoying the company of your fellow guild members, this is the place for you!  
  
**Recruiting**  
We are currently openly recruiting the listed classes and specializations for our Core Raider team. In addition, we are always openly recruiting all classes and specializations for our casual raiding team as well as social players who would like to be a part of our friendly community.  
  
* Death Knight (Blood) - High  
* Druid (Balance) - High  
* Monk (Windwalker) - Medium  
* Paladin (Retribution) - Medium  
* Rogue (Any Spec) - Medium  
* Shaman (Elemental) - High  
  
**Raiding**  
Battle Scars was formed half-way into The Nighthold raid tier. After developing our raid team, we ended Nighthold with 4/10 Mythic kills and look forward to progressing even further in Tomb of Sargeras where we have been able to advance into a new tier together as a team. Our current progression in Tomb of Sargeras is 7/9 Heroic.  
  
For continuing Tomb of Sargeras progression and looking forward towards the Antorus raid, we will be raiding three days per week (Thursday, Sunday, and Monday from 7:30pm to 10:30pm server time). We also have raids for the Normal level of the current tier on Wednesday that are mandatory at the beginning of the tier and change to optional after the first month.  
  
While we pride ourselves on our friendly community and non-toxic raiding environment, we do expect all members of our raiding team to come fully prepared and focused to our raids. We are able to create this unique environment by respecting our fellow raid members and the time, effort, and dedication that every other member of our team is putting in each day. As such, we prefer players who are excited about raiding and look forward to learning and working to progress through new content.  
  
**Contact**  
If you are interested in joining our community, please feel free to contact Branches or Joséphines in game. I can also be reached on BattleTag at Branches#21688 or via Discord at Branches#0460. Joséphines can also be reached via Discord at Jo (Joséphines)#4873. We look forward to hearing from you!  ",wow

There actual GUILDS right now who are progressing through normal. Yes, content that is easily puggable is still difficult for some ""raiding guilds"". There are many guilds who do not manage to get ahead of the curve each raid tier.

For me? Sure normal is irrelevant after 2-3 weeks since heroic is on farm and mythic bosses are going down. But for a vast part of the player base it is still relevant content. It still gives those players something to do while they wipe for 2 weeks on goroth heroic. 

Now you could come with the usual ""GIT GUD"" argument for those players, however they don't want that. They raid 1-2 times a week. They are people with jobs/kids, etc that can only spare 6hours/week for wow. They don't have ""optimized gear"", they don't have concordance, heck maybe some of them never really realized they can unlock new traits since 7.2.

Polishing the game engine would prove nothing. You would go into blackrock mountain and be like ""yup, thats BRM but prettier""

The only justifiable way they could pull off an entire sequel to WoW would be entirely different core game mechanics and story. Such as entirely new class system, new / different factions, new zones, different interface or combat system. Remember, graphics and engine dont make the game... But rather how it is played. Otherwise, from a business standpoint why reinvent the wheel to make the car prettier. The core mechanics of the game would have to be different.... Thus a different game",wow

You still have your personal character progression, the order hall just evolves with all characters instead of one. 

The beauty of this approach is that they can put more work into 2 ""halls"", making them evolve visually when you reach certain milestones or something. Sort of like the garrison I suppose, I still maintain that the garrison in and of itself wasn't the problem with WoD, it was the things the devs decided to do with it.

My personal favorite idea: the ""hall"" would be an airship, like the ones in Icecrown. It would also lend itself to the suspension of disbelief that you're not in an instanced area, that the other players with you on this airship are in fact in another airship from another group of players, better than the garrison did since it was stationary.

This is the reality I've faced in every single one. Did one last night with 4 friends. 2 healers, 3 DPS including me.

Couldn't find tanks or a 3rd healer. Found them all eventually, killed the first 4 bosses in normal without any wipes. Booted bad DPS, got new DPS. After every single one of those bosses, either a tank or the 3rd healer left. In the time we had to WAIT to get another, someone else left. It's a never ending cycle that eventually will kill the group when you no longer have tanks/healers queueing because they want to kill the half of the instance you have already cleared.

It's normal. It's not about wiping to content as you're implying, it's about putting asses in seats that don't leave every pull. Eventually, that well dries up and you're fucked. What should be a 90-120min run ends up being 240hrs over 5 days, re-killing bosses in 5-7 different groups because people bail the fuck out after 0 wipes.

There's is not that many guilds progressing through HC currently and the ones that are usually have a pretty setup member roster. So unless you get a lucky chance at an invite and/or a spot for a trial it'll be hard to join a guild that is already progressing HC. This is atleast what I've seen on my realm, which is not as highly populated as most realms(Anachronos-connected EU). That's just my opinion on it, maybe others will be able to post a better perspective of it. Good luck however! :)

Edit: Guilds that are recruiting also look at more than just your character IL or gear in general. They look for people that can perform like they actually have 907 gear, maybe even a bit higher. In my guild we have a few people in our HC progression team that are 900-903 IL but they pull 93+parses for their item level. So even if they only get 50-70 ranks on overal parses for that spec they still perform very well for their current gear. These are the recruits or members that our guild likes to put more effort into helping them gear up. When you're in Pugs try to pick up mechanics where other people fail them.  I.E: The robots on Trilliax in Nighthold. Even if that pull it's not your job to worry about the robots, actually helping out when and where you can and make the job easier for everyone in the group is what makes a person(especially dps) stand out. Doing this and picking up other people's slacks will get you noticed. If you get a bit lucky in the right pug you will find that person that has interest in your ability to play and will think of you as a potential worthy addition to their guild/team.",wow

39572,"Legion, like WoD has some detrimental factors, but I think a lot of the positive features in Legion are evolutions over MoP and WoD.  The Challenge Dungeons evolved into Mythic+.  The rotating dailies and daily zones evolved into the World Quest system.  The crafting system staying relevant as a catch up mechanic evolved from WoD's crafting system.  Class Order Halls add to the game without feeling like WoW is becoming a mobile management game, the way Garrisons were.  The trickling content was started in MoP and evolved into what we have today.

Some things did take a step back, though.  The leveling experience, although temporary, is a downgrade from WoD.  The legendaries system is a tough sell.  MoP started and WoD continued the trend of ""everyone gets a legendary if you put in the time!""  Legion tried to keep that, but make it rewarding early and stay relevant.  They did not do a great job of that, IMO.  I'm fine with the idea of RNG based legendary drops, but there should be a system to work towards replacements so you don't get totally hosed by RNG.  Also, the more screwed you get with the current system, the worse off you are as it's increasingly harder to get further legendaries.

On its own, the biggest system Legion added seems to be Artifacts.  Overall, I rate them well.  Artifact Knowledge has served as a nice gate/catch up mechanism that rewards the grind, but still enables relative catch up.  Interestingly, they're not done with artifacts yet.  I also wonder how they'll move on from the artifact system in the next expansion.

Overall, I'd say Legion feels better than WoD, but it also took a lot of features and feedback from WoD to make Legion possible.",wow

Giving SoE shit about a problem that still plagues us to this day is kind of disingenuous. And the bosses not having loot didn't deter the top EQ guilds.

If you have problems with them, then look up the strategy on Wowhead. But other than those bosses, you can just run in the raids, kill everything that's hostile, and loot everything.

42813,"&gt; ""Well maybe WoW just isn't for them."" Yeah, adopt that mindset and see how many players stay. I'm sure a good amount will, but frankly, a game shouldn't require a massive time commitment PLUS fifteen dollars every damn time you want to play it. Assuming someone has that mindset I just quoted, do you (who has that mindset, if you're reading this and want to respond) really want to be that much of an elitist that only people with the time and money to play WoW should be allowed to, and everyone else should just go fuck-off?

You said it yourself, there are plenty of games around besides WoW, much more so than before. So yeah, maybe WoW is not for everyone. 

I'm no elitist, in fact I speak as a casual who has always loved the game and has never had the time to invest enough in it to experience the ""high end game content"". I concede, WoW is not for me. I log in, do my emissary WQ and run a M+. I i'm stuck at 900 ilvl, which means i'm stuck at M+10 and LFR. Forget about being in a guild with strict raiding schedules and forget about puging at that ilvl. Forget about finishing a raid the same day I start it. I don't have 2 hours a day to play the game.

To be honest WoW requires a massive time commitment. It was worse before, granted, but still 2 hours a day is a MASSIVE amount of time for some people. WoW is for students, retirees, 9-5 people and freelancers. If you have an 80 hours a week high demand job and a wife, you don't get to play like 80% of the content. The key is to accept it instead longing for the game to adjust to your life schedule.

The problem is not balance in dps but rather you needing to deal with certain mechanics that require a soak.   You either need to stack immunities or bring an extra tank to help soak.    For example, you could probably bring a third tank to soak the extra Armageddon pretty easily and just rotate three tanks but then your losing dps which makes the entire fight harder.  Why not just stack immunities in that case.

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*! 

**Okay, so how do I start?**

43303,"Account wide progress on a lot of things. Secondary professions, reputation, prestige. I play mainly one character the entire time since I can't bring myself to play alts beyond just getting them to 110 and professions up for the achievements (major achievement hunter). They feel so behind.

Solo queue rated BGs and possibly arenas. Right now PvP just is not really worth getting into for many people and letting them just queue up for it would increase participation massively (hopefully many people would get interested and then go play in the premade brackets too).

More optional stuff, like brawlers guild, proving grounds, mage tower challenge, pet/toy/mount collections, achieves. I like to complete things and feel like I have a goal. Doesn't necessarily have to be a solo activity. I already have a raiding guild who gets CE every tier, adding more stuff that I have to do to be raid ready is not fun imo and takes away time from things I like to do. I'm sure this will be the most controversial point though since it seems a lot of people need to be forced into doing content to have fun rather than just finding and doing things they enjoy.

Edit: I looked further down and wanna say that I also really want to have player housing. Not garrisons, but just a house instance you can go to and put trophies from stuff you've done in. End-raid boss kills could drop something to put in a room. PvP could add a graveyard outside with size depending on how many HKs we have, etc. Pets could move in.

43550,I am real interested in where you get all this lore. I want to read it,wow
43569,"Agreed:  Germ does win out, regardless of group size, if your goal is healing priority targets.

Spring Blossoms winning out on large raids is premised on you doing baseline raid maintenance.

  &amp;nbsp;  

In most cases, that's a job better left to a non-druid (presuming you have a diverse healing lineup).  Predictable debuff damage, however, is one of the niche places where druid priority healing actually does win out.  We saw similar strength from Germ last tier for Mr. Dreadlord as well - even before the Shoulders got buffed into usefulness and 4 piece became presumed.

  &amp;nbsp;  

Perhaps it would be useful to explain the current raid healing meta - less so for the people posting here (most of the frequent posters seem capable of answering the questions) but more for the people lurking or just getting into raid healing.

Competitive raid healing this expansion has - outside countering specific elements like those mentioned here - been dominated by the model of the Druid-Shaman-Paladin triumvirate.  While it is adjusted to the fight mechanics, the basic segregation of duties for that lineup is fairly straightforward. 

The Shaman is there to provide weird shaman cooldowns - SLT, Ahnk totem for the spare brez, etc - and handle priority spot healing.  

The Paladin handles the bulk of the baseline tank healing and supplements spot healing.

The Druids (generally 2) handle baseline raid maintenance and supplement the tank healing with HoTs. (The exact line between priority spot healing and raid maintenance is somewhat murky and fight dependent, but you get the idea).

  &amp;nbsp;  

***In practice, with that class lineup, this segregation of duties happens almost automatically as a function of the class kits***  This holds even with slight variations in the specs involved.

  &amp;nbsp;  

You can readily slot other healers into those roles: you often had a disc priest instead of the 2nd druid until they got nerfed in EN and a bunch of people jumped ship.  A holy priest can slot into any of those roles fairly well.  Mistweaver slots well into the Shaman's healing niche (though they really still need more of a buff), but doesn't have SLT (which many raid consider near-mandatory because of its unique effect).

  &amp;nbsp;  

This lineup is not mandatory.  It is, however, more or less the baseline for the healing meta at the moment.  If you are running a radically different healing lineup (not merely changing a class out for a similar class in the same role, but having a class do something significantly different than is implied in its role in that lineup), much of the advice that is based implicitly on this segregation of duties will need to change.  

For example, consider a Disc/Disc/Druid/Druid lineup.
In that lineup, the disc priests would handle raid maintenance and the druids handling priority healing and Tank healing.  That radically changes druid talent selection and spell distribution. ",wow

The best raid systems have always been where you only need to clear the hardest difficulty you're capable of in order to maximize chances to further your character.

This specific issue isn't even about a video though, Sco just refused to give details about the fight which would probably not even give much of an edge for Exorsus.

Leveling 100-110 is actually fun and interesting because of things like artifact weapons, class storyline, and etc. As far as learning the class (of whatever you choose) you will know the common rotation by the time you hit 110.  As far as making friends in WoW goes it’s not that hard, there are some wonderful people willing to help out new players.

Reputations in wod was awful. They took the complaints about too many dailies from pandaria and then went the complete opposite direction. None of the reps had dailies and you had to grind thousands of mobs to hit exalted. Not only that, the rep rewards were completely underwhelming. Really low ilvl gear, new followers nobody cared about, and reskinned mounts. Tanaan jungle patch kind of fixed this by introducing the weekly event that allowed dungeons to give rep and the new tanaan reps were much better. Speaking of mounts, Wod literally took every mount that should have been on a rep vendor and instead sold them in the ingame store. Instead the playerbase ended up with a million reskinned boars, talkbuks, and such.

I also never said that they aren't surviving heroic KJ, I was just saying its harder to do as a DH if you are undergeared than as other characters since your ability to survive is locked behind having enough gear to survive with just Demon Spikes or otherwise relies on proccing Last Resort (a skill meant to save you from fuck ups more than an actual cooldown), or having very specific trinkets ready to save you, or externals.

None of the other classes rely on this, and none of these make DH unviable in the fight. Its just an unfortunate design result of how the strat ended up working out compared to how the Devs probably wanted it to work out. 

I think they meant for the tanks to split the stacks each time, with one of the tanks soaking the big Armas. DH would have been on equal footing if not an advantage in that situation. The strat turned into ""Use immunities for Armas and each tank takes 5 stacks"" which results in the issues I outlined above.",wow

46404,"&gt; So you think spamming PoH/shields is hard

If you're rolling as disc and spamming shields you'll go oom quickly. Unlike my druid who can spam rejuv and wild growth and end a fight at half mana. Priests have a lot more heals than ""PoH and shields"" and they have a lot more spells to cast than any other healer. Managing all the different spells and knowing when to cast them takes some measure of thought. 

Yes I think if you have two average players, and you make one play a priest and the other play a druid, the one playing the druid will have a much easier time figuring it out.

You really have never played a healer have you? Tranq targets the 5 *lowest health* members of the raid, so once it heals someone up, it targets someone who is lower than them. It heals up the entire raid (10 man at least). It's a very valuable raid CD and you're an idiot to suggest otherwise.

You really sound like you have no idea what you're talking about.",wow
46406,"Were you posting a link? Or is this some meta comment about ""there is nothing""?",wow
46414,"You're not 110, so that'll definitely contribute but primarily you probably need more haste - 35-40% is the 'general' goal with Bone Shield up. The more haste you get the better off you'll be. 

Additionally, running Spectral Deflection (if you are) means you need to Marrowrend a LOT more to keep Boneshield up.",wow
46417,"Right so our goal in gearing is to get between 40%-50% haste with the bone shield buff. It's completely up to you where you stop stacking haste. At around 40% it is not longer our best stat it ends up being tied with Vers until about 50% where vers overtakes haste.

As for mastery. There are a lot of things affecting this. So I'll try to go through them all and explain why. 

One reason is that Death Strike costs RP instead of runes now. So the faster we generate runes the faster we can generate RP and the more we can death strike so more healing and therefore more shield. 

Another issue is that our mastery scaling is completely garbage in this expansion. In previous expansions we heal'd for more and more of that healing was converted into a shield. IIRC it used to be 50% of the healing you did baseline.

One last issue is that bosses melee for a lot more of our HP for some reason. Meaning it's harder to build up a decent blood shield. Back in HFC Archimonde max hit me for like 450k and I had around 800k health. In Legion bosses like Demonic inquisition randomly max hit me for 5 mil+ and I'm sat at 7mil HP. 


A funny thing about this is that originally our Unending Thirst talent worked like this. When your blood shield expires you heal for 50% of your missing HP and explode dealing damage to enemies around you equal to the health you heal'd. 

The current iteration of our mastery feels like they designed Blood DK's to work with this trait. They then removed the trait but didn't fix our mastery scaling. It would explain why BDK were so weak for so long. Aside from Blizzard being incompetent.

TL;DR Our mastery starts off at a low baseline, it has crappy scaling. Shields generated are too small and get removed instantly by boss melee hits.",wow
46422,What was Blizzard's reasoning behind giving Druids 4 specs and not giving an extra to others? I don't think I ever heard.,wow

49486,"It requires getting the legendary, but it has downtime until them, and that can be offputting for people coming into the class. As a Pre-WoD survival main, it's really dissapointing to me that the closest the class is to what I used to like about Survival(Decent/high movement, Pet oriented, Traps and procs galore, even better when it was Wrath/Cata Survival) is BM. BM really could use a small waster builder like Arcane shot(like, half the damage, half the focus gain, something like that), probably in the spot of a talent where it can be an optional choice until proper legendaries are recieved. I mean, chimera shot seems generally to be universally bad, could just redesign its focus instead to be a better builder. the move towards the 2 charges though has definitely helped, but the class still needs some work.",wow

After defeating Garrosh, Thrall was about to bring his hammer down on his head and kill him, but Varian stopped him.

50010,"I did a +11 healing for the first time on a mistweaver yesterday. I've got a good ilvl but not good itemization for MW. The DPS was generally pretty weak (pure DPS output, that is), so for Maw 11, the length of the fights was kind of an issue. During the second fight, the DPS were taking Scythes to the face CONSTANTLY and then blaming me for not healing faster. Helya was a problem when two DPS took the barrage to the face in the first phase, and then on a second attempt, one DPS took the barrage again, leaving us 4 manning it. In the end, the DH tank soloed 2.5% of Helya's HP (which is a lot).

They insta-kicked me as the boss died, but I got a 935 cloak out of it (mind you this was an 11) so I think everything worked out okay.",wow

I remember Shaman being ridiculously bad to level starting out in Vanilla, but they're totally different now.  Mages also.  There were certain points levels you had to eat every pull.  Also probably not the same, but can't say for sure.

50829,"I rarely ever say an expansion is bad. I've loved most expansions because it's new and provides some story advancement. (I'm a lore nerd).

Warlords was probably the first expansion that I deemed my least favorite. Don't get me wrong, it had its high points. The quests, the zones, the story driven content (which argus is all about, so all aboard the hype train).

The raids were neat. But the content gaps was what killed a potentially decent expansion. People bring up that Mop had the same issue. And yes, it did. But only really at the end. 15 months of siege. 

What really put a damper on it for me, wasn't so much the content drought. It was how the story just died. Like they completely half assed it and stopped caring. Alternate timeline stories are usually cringy, but the idea of a different, uncorrupted clan of orc conquerors was pretty cool.

They handled it very poorly though. Kargath? Easiest boss in the first raid. Nerzhul? 5 man dungeon boss. Like really?

Let's not forget the ""Draenor is free!!"" Ending of WoD. That infuriated me. That entire expansion didn't even matter aside from alternate guldan kickstarting legion. Idk, just pisses me off that the expansion started off so strong, only to have their writers go on vacation letting the newly hired interns finish up.",wow

Yogg zero had a rather large nerf also after about 15 ish guilds killed him. I remember Sunwell also got progressive nerfs, Muru got a 5-10% nerf after 2-3 months.

For example, I'm in a mythic guild that's 4/9 mythic rn, gonna be 5/9 on monday (Lol desolate host is a joke). I'm playing a DH, but I still don't have anger of the half giants. So I have to run every single old raid, every single LFR, and spam M+ until I can get anger of the half giants. The other 2 demon hunters in the guild still have anger of the half giants, so it's difficult to compete. They simply have more fury to work with than me.  So guess who gets sat on fights where we have too many melee or say my class isn't good on?

51920,"The first issue is that old zones feel dated and no longer jive with the current lore. In addition, leveling has been trivialized and no longer feels rewarding. I think Blizz should have had a smaller ""cleanup"" team from the start who go through zone by zone and bring it up to the current standard after an expac has ended. Unfortunately they never instituted such a thing and by now there is too much content to clean it all up in any reasonable amount of time. The team that handled the Cata revamp did a great job on quest quality and flow, but they admitted that they spent too much time and effort on content that few people now appreciate. They seem to be set in the mindset that outdated content is not ""worth it"" to revamp, I wish they would reconsider, I like leveling through old zones and experiencing the story. 

Another related issue is that (some) people want legacy servers, if for nothing other than to experience Vanilla as it was before BC. I actually wish they would do this as part of the effort for preserving lore and letting people experience the older gameplay mechanics. This has been criticized though with claims that not enough people would want to play legacy versions of the game ""because they dont change"". If handled correctly however, I think it would be a boon to player retention and game value. 

My proposed solution to these issues is to have a dedicated team go through all the old zones and update them to a current ""after the fact"" state. Nothing fancy but a simplified questline through each zone that eventually leads up to the current expac. If zone scaling and/or world quests work in this environment, institute that too. Simultaneously release Legacy Servers for each expansion in the state it was before the last pre-patch. All the quests, raids and events are preserved on each server for its expansion. If you want to experience Legacy content, you must play on the Legacy Server, and you must start with Vanilla. Once you get to max level on that Legacy Server, you have the option to transfer that toon to the next Legacy Server in the chronology, so after Vanilla would be Burning Crusade, all the way up to the last outdated expansion. To provide additional incentives, certain achievements and rewards should be given, for example for defeating Ragnaros at level 60, or getting Vanilla Loremaster, etc. In this way you could level ""easily"" on the primary servers with no lore contradictions, or you could do it the ""hard"" way on legacy servers and get a special prize at the end. I would have only one server for each legacy expansion to keep population high, but I am sure some people would also keep toons on each legacy server for raiding and min/maxing or for PVP. 

This would take a lot of work by Blizzard so I doubt they will ever do something like this, but honestly at this point it should be trivial to institute Legacy Servers. That coupled with a revamp of all the older zones would really propel the game into a more logical state. I also would like to see access to all of the above covered with the same sub we already pay. The goal would to bring more people back who would spend time on the legacy servers while retaining people who would rather level. ",wow

Two different environments, quite extremely so, would lead to two form of people with different mindsets.

At the same time, the Man'ari Eredar wouldn't be quite like the original Eredar, though perhaps more so, since the original Eredar were known to favour knowledge and the arcane above all else, which can be summed up in ""power"".

The 4 legendary items that you get at the end of each zone when you do the dungeon after the quest chain. I'm wondering if you have do to that to unlock the full class campaign, because if you do, that's way more time consuming than just leveling using invasions.

You are incorrect to assume it's always after bosses have been nerfed, I've raided in Top 100 US guilds, Top 20 US guilds, it's all the same. We have never class stacked. The only reason you would ever think class stacking is necessary is because you, yourself, have not played at this level of progression and would rather assume the game is more unbalanced then it is.

&gt;at this time illidan was just saving his own ass. he wasnt willingly serving them but wasnt using them either.

he wasnt saving his own ass, he was using them and remember his own brother just exiled him from his own homeland for the crime of saving felwood and killing a dreadlord so even if you refuse to accept the established canon of Illidan, the first DEMON HUNTER, being focused on hunting demons then hes still justified in his actions, why shouldnt he join his peoples enemies when his people treat him like one of them anyway?",wow

Whenever I feel a bit bored with one class/role I can jump over to a different one for a pretty new feeling. I think it does well too for people with weird schedules.  can hop on for a short amount of time and do some questing or I can grind out a raid on my off day.

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*! 

**Okay, so how do I start?**

Lol, 95th percentile isn't true balance.",wow
54309,"&gt;We'll get ICC because it is the best all around raid in Wrath.

I simply can't agree with that. There's only five fights in the instance that weren't absolute push overs: Deathwhisper, Deathbringer, Putricide, Sindragosa, and the Lich King.

(You could make an argument for dreamwalker based on it having interesting mechanics but it was a total snooze fest in practice because it was tuned too easy)

Deathwhsiper was your typical add fight, Saurfang had a couple of really neat mechanics but is pretty straight forward, and Sindragosa might have been the worst designed fight of the expansion.

So that leaves Putricide and LK as fights that were difficult, interesting, and fun, with heroic Lich King being possibly the best fight ever made in an MMO.

Meanwhile in Ulduar had Flame Levi, the four Keepers, Yogg, and Algalon.

Flame Leviathan is probably too controversial to argue as an interesting fight so I'll concede that one off the bat, Hodir is just a don't stand in stuff and do insane DPS, so that's pretty meh too. Thorim and Freya were both decently interesting fights in their own respect, about as interesting as Deathwhisper and Deathbringer.

So, in you have Yogg/Algalon/Firefighter as the best fights in Ulduar vs Putricide and LK, and while LK himself is one of the best fights ever made, I just don't think he's enough to bring his entire instance above Ulduar.

**But** I still think we'll get ICC for Timewalking for a few reasons:
The Lich King story is relevant again in the same way BT is right now.
Ulduar has a lot of complex mechanics (in particular it's hard mode activators) that really don't lend themselves well to a timewalking raid.

My friend, who's a pally tank, can take and mitigate plenty of damage (his block percent is something like 40%), and the good healers we've had who weren't stupid could crit for over 60k pretty consistently. I think it's safe for me to say that my experience with a group can usually be determined on how good the healer is.

Oh geez, thank you!

&gt; Can't wait for the T7 units reliance revamp you've promised. :P

Until I get slightly less lazy, the revamp is that Valeera is Blue and the other T7s are Green. If you want a quick TL;DR, it's that I'm actually thinking of ditching T7s if it means a class can be 2/2/2 for both Specs and Counters. Some classes just get screwed and it's better to keep the Healing Item champion, sometimes it's better to ditch them for someone better (Rogues especially, mostly because of how awkward Valeera is and I didn't even want to try her in actual practice).

I'm well aware the spreadsheet isn't perfect and I'm more than happy to admit mistakes and faults, provided people don't start holding pitchforks for using their legendaries on the wrong champions! :)

 I know part of that is the fact that it was my first MMOPRG, but also it was some aspects of  original Everquest that are not reproduced in WoW.

  also they allowed difficulties to remain in game which made it so much more rewarding when you accomplished something.

Not just that, but it was the deciding factor, after seeing all the RNG with leggos and TF in the beginning of the xpac, then seeing certain WQ not showing up, then seeing them nerf DH mastery to the bottom tank. Then when I saw the world boss system was messed up as well, I said screw it, come back when this shit is figured out.

On top of that I specifically remember killing the same world boss a couple weeks in a row during 7.1.5 multiple times after coming back. Maybe the world bosses didn't come up 2 weeks in a row, but they have definitely not been in a rotation (unless you count something like jim-nithogg-jim-nithogg as a proper rotation)

56044,I find myself motivated to not do them as well. My iLvl had me struggling to do +10 before the buff. With my TOS gear now I can now finally heal a +10 again. But now the weekly chest doesn't upgrade my gear much. I guess I just have to get better at the game as I mained healing for the longest time and I am starting to tank so now I have to learn all the dungeon boss fights and it's difficult on higher mythics to find an understanding group. So definitely less motivation to do Mythic+'s but more to do with me being not the best healer or tank rather than the changes. ,wow

57149,"Survival is somewhat my personal continuing ""WTF is happening""-moment. 

It's not like the game needed another melee spec to begin with or more than a handful of people would actually roll hunter to play as melee. Nope, they even delete a (universally liked) ranged spec for it and fail to preserve the playstyle in the MM talent tree. 

So bad start aside, survival isn't even in a remotely good spot designwise. They have to manage a complete clusterfuck of absolutely uninteractive abilities, have to target traps in combat (or use macros), are punished heavily by switching targets, movement or doing mechanics, have probably the most underwhelming artifact ability (even worse than affliction locks in my opinion and those had a last minute 180° before going live and then got a maintenance buff) and the spec has no distinct feel whatsoever. Why do I throw grenades on a target that has my birdos swirling around it. Also why do I summon a snake as DPS cooldown? Aren't those BM things? What's the fuzz with all the ""fire and steel"" theme that kind of doesn't fit to rexxar or the spearfighter thing we got going..

What are we supposed to be? Blessed spearfighters that summon beasts? Hardened survivalists that lay traps, poison their weapons and ambush people? Maniacs that use explosives while being in melee range? Guess all of it. A bit. Problem is nothing of this works in combination. Multiple poorly thought out ideas frankensteined together and there we are. 

I tried playing survival on and off mostly for nighthold because I wanted a more demanding spec and thought that fighting with a spear is kind of badass but asides some very few occasions in which you could hit really hard with butchery it felt underwhelming even when you don't fuck up anything.. Also blizzard doesn't even try to improve them. I don't remember even one blue post/ dev talk/ anything that even acknowledged that something somewhere probably went wrong and what they have planned for the spec. 

Probably nothing because the mix of a very small target audience and that the spec also turned out pretty bad didn't leave over that many people to justify the rework the spec would need to be attractive.

So yeah, I get a strong ""failed experiment""-vibe while playing the spec atm...

I'll start with the social aspect. You know how people complain about how ""empty"" the world feels. In part because group finder makes it so you don't have to build groups and go to the dungeon anymore. 

The Mythic system addresses this in the same way as the rated vs unrated system does. It forces you to socialize, interact, and strategize/experiment  which are opportunities to MAKE friends.

The other reason is for more specific to RBGs. Prebuilt teams with communication will generally stomp randomly made teams. If you want a YOLO team, it isn't that hard to find. However you want to generally encourage as many premade teams as possible, so they can queue against eachother. A system with ranked solo queing would make queue times for premade teams even longer(or lower the quality of games greatly for non premade teams).

You may want to have your guildmates all try simple things like running a traceroute to the server to see if you all go through the same congested node.

They also discuss it in Chronicle Vol 2 (a Na'aru that succumbs to the void becomes a mass of void energy that the orcs refer to as a ""dark star"").

The snapshotting is specifically related to three abilities (Tiger's Fury, Bloodtalons, Savage Roar). With all 3 buffs up it is a 216% increase in damage. Without TF its a 188% increase in damage. A half decent Feral will be able to empower 100% of their DoTs to at least 188% and just over half theirs to 216%. 

The ""Snapshotting"" is nowhere near the insane difficulties of managing as people let off, as in 90% of cases you're keeping SR up 100% of the time and using the instant cast heal for Bloodtalons before a finisher, then you use the finisher and either refresh Rake or just shred to 5 again and repeat if rake isn't close to expiring.

The difficulty comes during the windows where multiple things are falling off at once, and most people lose DPS there as they start to panic and do either shitty refreshes or let everything fall off. Either way it forces them to ""reset"" their rhythm. 

Ferals that can avoid having to reset their rhythm (it happens to all of us occasionally, no matter the skill) and reset it quickly when things go sour are the ones you see topping the meters.  That mostly just comes with time with the spec. ",wow

If you fear about people not being able to play their class, then block dungeon search/group search for raids/dungeons/lfr/pvp/etc until they complete a challenge, only harder, like the one from WoD or MoP.  
Would prove they know how to complete the challenge with their class, while saving them from the tedious and boring leveling, where the difficulty lies in finding the quest objective and one-shotting it. ",wow

60819,"[Here's some statistics from logs in ToS](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/statistics/13/#difficulty=4). However I slice the data, BM is lower half and MM is upper half. Icy Veins says it best:

&gt; Now that 7.2.5 has released, we can say with reasonable confidence and assuming no major changes, that Marksmanship will be the optimal raiding spec going into Tomb of Sargeras, mostly due to the potency of its new set bonuses. Its strengths remain the same as in the past, with a variety of different talents allowing for different playstyles, making it the most powerful spec for both single-target and multi-target in terms of raw damage. Its disadvantage on target switching has been significantly reduced, since Vulnerable no longer gives as much of a damage bonus to Aimed Shot that you cannot live without it. The spec is still much more limited by movement than Beast Mastery, and in hectic raiding situations this is its only potential downfall.

&gt; Beast Mastery remains a solid choice, though rather than being very competitive and sometimes even better at single-target than Marksmanship in ideal situations, it is now fair to say that its potential output is less than Marksmanship in nearly all situations. The same goes for Survival. Both these specs have fairly mediocre new Legendaries, and they do not benefit nearly as much from their set bonuses as Marksmanship does. Beast Mastery's ease of play and movement remains its biggest strength.",wow
60831,"There is a glow, but not that strong. [Look here](https://youtu.be/-jfkqHeuC2g?t=46s), and now look at my screen.",wow
60842,"not necessary that they shouldn't have more gear, but instead that you shouldn't be punished so hard for taking time away from the game and focusing more on your life between tiers. Trust me I'm not trying to take your legendaries away, and in MMOs its always been a thing that they want you playing in some form 24/7, but this system brings it to another level. There is no reason you should be expected to make a game you pay to play a major part of your every day life. A lot of raiders have voiced this opinion by quitting or going completely casual, because in the current model, the old model of playing doesn't fit. you can't devote a month or two to the game and take a month or two off anymore, its either you play constantly or don't play at all and its really just not practical with real life.

EDIT: I feel the need to also bring up the fact that certain(a lot) of classes and the way to play them correctly is tied directly to certain leggos. If it was that leggos just added some extra stats, or added an effect that buffs you but not complete changing your rotation and play style, then the amount of RNG tied to them wouldn't be so bad, but because some classes have make-or-break leggos and you have a chance to not get them until the end, and there is not direct path to get these or choose which you get, it seems a little broken.

60874,"Mages have a very wide gap between the bad, the good, and the great players. Srs great players are putting in twice more damage than good players but bad players are doing like 300-400k dps at ilvl 900+. 

If you can put in the time and effort to being a good mage id say mage. Tos has alot of mechanics where immunity is prized because there are so many soaking mechanics. Theyre also able to target down priority targets much better which is really important. Only destrolocks have a good target switching capability out of the lock specs. 

I play an afflock. Always did, always will. I dont care about class buffs and nerfs or whatever, its the class fantasy, the feel, the dots, the playstyle especially in pvp, and the xmogs that make me love this class.

In my case, I never feel it IRL, but only looking at images or in games does it appear, especially when it's giant empty structures in flat plains or open spaces, which Karazhan kinda checks out pretty well.

A dragon, like any creature/animal, walks around naked. If you want to get technical, when in humanoid form, they should be naked, and likely would be less comfortable in clothing of any kind.

Not even close to how Realmpop works.

&gt; To get the list of characters for a realm, first we record all the characters who posted to the auction house. Then we fetch and record their guild rosters. This should cover the majority of characters on a realm. To avoid getting listed, a character must never post to the auction house, and never belong to a guild where a guild member posts to the auction house.",wow

Legs, pickup the JP T11 legs, spirit/haste ftw.  Also use the Int/Spirit leg enchant over the stam one.

Hands I'd swap out for earth ring exalted ""Flamebloom gloves"".  Haste/Mastery, and if you swap your legs, you'll keep the 2 pce T11.

Headpiece isn't optimal as it doesn't have haste as a base stat, but there's nothing 359 you can pickup straight away without having it as a drop.  The one from BoT 2nd boss is pretty damn good, big whack of hit &amp; haste on it.

Gemming I only go for socket bonus if I can maintain the 40int per gem used ratio.  (e.g. leg has 1 x red, 1 x something else, +20 socket bonus.  Yay go for it.)

Reforging seems fine, main thing I do different is I reforge any hit I have to spirit, otherwise it's fine.  Might want to go that last .07% :)

63308,"Others replied to it fully, so with very little to add here - it depends on what we are looking for. In terms of current raids in Legion, If I was looking for a semi-carry to get AotC/gear, I would probably set the required ilevel approximately +5 above the average loot drop ilvl (let's say, 905 for normal and 915-920 for heroic, 925 may be a touch demanding for a week or two). If I were to purposedly run it with alike people who want to progress and actually learn the raid and get it done, I'd be willing to set 900 for normal, 910 for heroic, maybe even 895/905 assuming only a partial clear, it's enough for the lower bosses if people stick to mechanics. The only problem is that a typical progression raid and a PUG group are at least somewhat mutually exclusive. Not impossible, though! Last week I've been in a casual group (advertised as such) with the min. ilvl 895 and it actually pulled off a very decent 5/9 clear of normal Tomb with little to no derps simply because people listened to advice/tactics from those a bit more experienced.

Valor upgrades have to be introduced late in a tier to avoid trivializing content while titanforging and warforging can be introduced immediately, even during questing.


Once a new raid tier has begun, though, it no longer makes sense for old gear to WF/TF beyond new gear. That creates the trap of farming for the best available trinkets when you're A) not guaranteed a drop in the first place and B) are probably never going to see that specific piece titanforge.

I've done LFR ToS a couple of times now and usually regret it immensely. 

Firstly, I'm 931 equipped on my main tank. My alt is 925 equipped and my second alt is 921 equipped. 

My first run through, had a druid cotank that seemed to be decently geared, but didn't really know the fights so we just chatted about them in whispers. No threat issues, and they were good on the swaps. 

Second run through... fairly fresh cotank... with some other VDH thrown in (he queued as DPS because they had a satchel, but ""I do more DPS as tank lol I'm not switching to DPS"") that would cause the boss to randomly turn and hit the raid with stuff because they didn't seem to know that tank specs generate more threat, I dunno. 


Most recently, ran with a warrior... who couldn't keep threat at all. Usually I can auto attack while standing there with tanks, but not this guy. No idea what was up, but they ended up leaving after the second boss anyway... which leads us to... the fresh protadin (840!?) that must have been an offspec or something because I thought for sure you needed to be a bit higher ilevel than that to get in.  I'd say he needed to taunt... and he would be dead.  Pretty sure that they used 2 or 3 brez on him before just leaving him dead and healing through the purple lightning damage. 


Honestly, I'm probably going to stop running LFR. I don't particularly enjoy it, I only ran the previous raids lfr enough to get the tier set color transmogs and then stopped. While I've seen others get legendaries from it, I've never gotten one myself, and I only have 2 DPS legendaries left to get before I have all of them available to my class anyway, so I'm not in a rush. 

Tomb's LFR is so ridiculously undertuned, and Desolate Host doesn't even pop out, you just wail on the two mobs until they are dead...  it's not even remotely a fight I enjoy.

My point is, for a Heroic only guild, Concordance levels shouldn't dictate wether or not you can apply, it should be a fairly casual environment. Would you take a player with Concordance? Or someone who pulls the same dps without it?  Obviously the latter, because getting them those extra traits will turn them into a better dps for your raid team.

Boj &gt; cs &gt; judge+crusade &gt; tv &gt; torrent &gt;  tv &gt; wake &gt; tv &gt; tv and so on.
Also as i looked at your trinket cast as far as i recall you want to use your trinket at 15 stacks of crusade, im using goroth fight as an example you used even before wake. So get 15 stacks and use it after.

Remember that trinket is best used in a scenario where boss doesn't move aswell as you want to stack 2 ghosts on top of each other.

Ok more looking into:

Demonic inquisition: you didn't use your specter during crusade at all, also you are using TV at start which honestly you should have the bosses both stacks during opener with bloodlust to burst them down.

Harjatan: same applies for umbral at 15 stacks i think which you did there although it ended make sure you use it on top of as many mobs as possible.

Mistress : your crusade was casted at 20 sec into fight? you wanna do it on pull and again use your trinket like umbral/specter/vial at 15 stacks of crusade.

Sisters : I imagine horn placed your specter at that late meaning you miss out on 15 stacks of cruade on specter,  im not sure but its probably worth casting horn 5 sec before pull so you can get 15 stack specter out.

Desoalce : same as again umbral is higher priority in this fight imo, its even worth casting it with less stacks since adds die so fast anyhow.

My druid is a scribe, though, and I wanted to learn the Origami Beetle. To my surprise I found that the zone wasn't as high of a level as I thought. I started killing stuff, and got the technique pretty quickly, and then staarted gathering whiptail, and was generally having a good time. So when I did hit level 83 I was pretty excited to go back. I've been doing a bunch of stuff, including some fishing -- and some of that sold very well, so I'll keep doing it even though my druid's fishing is only level 300 at the moment so I'm catching lots of crud. But I just did the quest to go into the Vortex Pinnacle. There was a quest to kill Asaad, and I noticed that the experience for the reward was pretty high -- then saw that the things in there are elites, and oh hey, I guess this is a dungeon. Time to leave... wait. I need to jump out the portal, and I'm not really fond of heights. But hearthstone on cooldown, so... here goes nothing. Oh! No big deal, I'm back on the platform thing.

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*! 

**Okay, so how do I start?**

67090,"You write way to much I'm not even sure what you want. (for example the sorry boss line is nonsensical and doesn't add to your message) 

That said use class trials you can demo a level 100 took for a little while. ",wow

67121,Of course just yesterday I went through as much lore as I could. This would've been helpful then.,wow
67135,So about sephuz secret. I know that we havocs need a lot more haste and since i am running sephuz and anger i get a lot more dps (both in raids and in sims) but i feel like people are dissing sephuz for other legendarys saying its hella bad. This is not my experience since the proc that gives more haste feels so damn good! And it shows in the meters as well. Donyou think sephuz will get a lot more love now in 7.2.5?,wow
67152,"Truthfully if you want max gains just make a DH, get to 101, turn off exp, and equip as many Mastery BoEs as you possibly can. I finished all of AQ40 in 9 minutes. I was also using the boot legendaries as well as bear tartar, and I farmed enough AP to get the fade 40% speed trait",wow
67155,"Eh, I'd personally rank GW2 and ESO way higher than BDO and FFXIV, but I couldn't care less about PvP and that's a lot of Twitch viewership no matter what game you're playing so",wow
67156,I have infernal writ as Arcane mage. Should I wait for proc stacks to use my burst or burst asap every time arcane power is up?,wow
67157,If MoP continued the techological trend of improvement then why do you think it's worse? You just don't like the theme? That's fine but doesn't mean it was terrible. People unsubbed mostly because it was a change of theme they didn't like. But it was still well designed.,wow
67165,"Okay, i get that his choice of words and this distinct attitude of his may turn people off, but after watching a few videos of him talking about recent changes i feel like he always gives deep insight and context to his opinions. What i'm saying is: he doesn't seem like an idiot. ",wow
67173,WoD SMV is like super super fucking pretty. Also has my single favorite piece of WoW music [ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0k_T72hjdw). Seriously this is the fucking best. ,wow

67249,"After focusing on classes, next expansions definitely could focus on races next. Each boat army with different styles. And naval battles.",wow
67252,"Can't answer the first, but to the second: bear, cat, travel, moonkin, tree, stag (rideable). OP is a boomkin (at least in this clip). Tree is a glyph and purely aesthetic. The rest are standard to all specs. ",wow
67259,"If it's above 15 then sure, I honestly rarely ever even see those listed in PUGs and would personally never do it outside of a guild group anyway. But I'm talking about pulling this for like 10s.",wow
67289,"WW AoE is still one of the best, and while leveling it's way more than enough. ",wow
67304,"I think its due to the growing population that can't spell or piece together a sentence, google managed to keep up with the human race hahahaha.  
",wow
67309,"The only real filler is crusader's strike, everything else is more buildy/spendy where the dps feels more or less in your control.",wow
67331,"Yeah but at that point I still have a dalaran and garrison, and if I'm going around with 2 I might as well have 3. I really don't like dalarans layout so I use stormwind exclusively for everything i need. But I also play the auction house with gathering professions and having a hearthstone more locally set there while also having one in stormwind is super helpful. It just saves time and I think it's redundant to have a spell copy an item so blatantly 

Also my inventory isn't ever so full that one extra slot is some saving grace ",wow

67410,You've pretty much demonstrated one part of why I always whisper the other tank if they're not doing mechanics instead of just telling at them. I also try to offer to give them advice if they want it because I know a lot of LFR tanks are just getting started.,wow
67415,"For mythic plus you'd want the helmet and the ring, probably :) ",wow
67424,Had an enh shammy get the drop on the first boss. I was bummed. Then it dropped for me on the very next boss. I was happy. ,wow
67450,"But not every boss in WoD had one, and not every Boss in Legion has had one.  using the fact that every boss in MoP had one to ensure us that this one does seems strange.

The Devs have talked about this multiple times in interviews, saying do not expect a mythic only phase in every end boss.  many times they feel the Fight is epic enough as it is, and other times there is something really unique that they want to add in, like the illidan fight in Guldan.  They play it by ear.

I'm presuming that a fight that already has 5 phases is probably not going to have a 6th,",wow
67453,"&gt;I bet mages are still gimpy as shit

No.

[http://stateofdps.com/](http://stateofdps.com/)

I don't think mages have ever been 'gimpy as shit', they've consistently been top10 which is impressive in a game with so many dps specs. Arcane is currently #1, though that site still hasnt been updated yet to show the new raids.

Arcane is a rediculous return of investment on complexity of rotation vs dps you get out of it. I greatly outgear our mage and he still outdpses me often just because of how hard it is to keep my rotation (as a destro warlock) 100% optimal while handling all the raid mechanics.  And then theres the cooldown management I have to deal with, if procs go off at the wrong time or hero is called for when mine are down..theres no way I'll beat him. Dont get me started on having my biggest DPS cd be a 10min cd that doesnt reset on death, which means only getting to blow it every other pull when learning a fight.

Arcane mages have it pretty easy really.",wow
67455,When in doubt press Ancient Hysteria to make mages and shamans extra salty.,wow
67494,"This is an article about someone who isn't satisfied with various elements of the game gripe about of it, and he just happens to be a journalist for a PC magazine. Besides, I don't think he ever got to raid.

These people are convinced that WoW is dying since 2006. 

Also:

&gt;It might take a year; it might take five years.  But mark my words: WoW has passed its peak.

Like this is any news, but in five years Blizz will have a next-gen MMO AND Wow going.",wow
67540,So fresh 110's will jump to 45 or 50 or whatever?,wow
67565,"there's no quest there :/ only quest I can find in my entire class hall is the one to get my 3rd artifact. I even just did the ""pay 1000g to this grifter dude"" quests. It says its supposed to start from one of my followers, so I've tried not sending him on missions and abandoning quest and all that jazz and nothing works.",wow
67570,If it still uses the same animation skeleton then it doesn't matter,wow
67595,"No problem.  I guess Blizzard does that so people don't bind regular mouse clicks and then wonder why they can't Target or get the right click menus.  No idea why it affects mouse buttons 3, 4, etc.  
",wow
67611,"i wish horde and alliance could communicate like that.

maybe they should do a reverse pandarean quest. like ALO and the outcast village where everyone goes when they renounce their faction.",wow
67612,"Where I think he's coming from, is that compared to cata-wod era, tanks have been simplified a lot. Aggro is a passive thing,and most rotations of tank specs revolve around ""pressing 3 ""no cost, 5-10s cd damage"" spells that are quite boring, with the only actual tanking coming down to pressing your mitigation button at the right time.

Playing a tank feels like I'm the dps that just so happens to soak the damage, but because I have that mitigation button to press, my dps rotation is simplified. I see why tanking went in this direction, I see where Blizz is coming from, but I personally don't like it.",wow
67644,"Excuse my lack of knowledge here, but what are shards? ",wow
67686,"When you flurry it applies a debuff to the enemy target that counts it as a frozen target, and frost mages at a crit % of 33.3% have 100% crit against frozen targets. Due to travel time if you frostbolt then flurry as the frostbolt ends the flurry hits first, and then the frostbolt counts as being hit into a frozen target aka shattered. So the frostbolt crits, the flurry hits, then after the flurry you ice lance too which also hits into the winters chill debuff from the flurry. This crits all of your 3 abilities just from a single brain freeze proc.",wow
67709,"Considering Legion is less than a year old, that's pretty recent, especially for wow's lifetime.

Also I totally thought you meant, like, OG launch. Like WoW launch. Apologies.",wow
67743,Yeah it's crazy.  I have done 500 WQ and have yet to see one at all.  ,wow
67752,"Yeah once I tie up what am doing in FFXIV am going to give wow another try, I do miss the game
just missing out on patches always makes you feel lost",wow
67771,"I mean she had no clue that Sargeras had accomplished his actual goal, and put a piece of himself into her soul. Then she had Medivh (Talk about a fuck up right there), and gave him the powers of the Guardian. Medivh will be back, I guarantee it.",wow
67772,"Crashing Storm doesn't increase expenditure; Fury of Air does.  There's really an expenditure cap where you can leave yourself waiting for Rockbiter to come back up, so trying to go HAM fishing for Ascendance procs with gloves can have a DR.

I'll concede that LB can help you spend, but if your other talents already push you to overspending then the result is a wash.",wow
67785,"If you can't even play the bare minimum to keep yourself geared for the qualifiers of a big ol' competition, I don't see why you should be upset that you don't qualify. 

""Waah, I don't play any hockey even though I was really great that one time my friends played pick-up in his driveway and the coach won't let me on the team!""

I know it's not the best analogy, but seriously man. If you don't play enough to gear up, there's zero reason why you should expect to place in this kind of competition. Like, play the game and enjoy it, and do well when you play normally, but this is a serious competition. 

I don't play seriously, none of my characters are over 900 ilvl. Even if I was really good when I bothered to play, I wouldn't expect to do very well in a competition where I'm going up against people who play seriously, and play enough to keep themselves on the cutting edge gearwise.",wow
67788,"Hmm. Maybe I should take up drinking, perhaps then I'll be able to stomach heroics enough to cap my VP each week.",wow
67800,"Those 25 ilvls are assuming secondary stats are equal to int. This is simply not the case for every class. For example, holy priest would only be an ~18 ilvl equivalent.",wow
67816,"I bought it over a year ago, think I could get my account credited? /s.  

Edit: typo",wow
67823,I've had it for a while on my fire mage.  It truly shines when you unleash it into a large pack of adds.,wow
67827,"sooo you are saying level them up to 10 so you dont hit delete , then TYPE DELETE without realising you are going to DELETE instead of logout?

67834,"Dude that would look... weird. Like you're supposed to be meditating in a yoga pose, so why the hell are you burning along at mach 3?

But I dunno, opinions are opinions, go for it if you want. ",wow
67842,"I bet a ton of celebrities and famous people play wow. I mean think about it, you can't go out in public without being harassed all the time, in wow you can actually socialize and be in groups of people and no one has any clue who you are besides your character. ",wow
67855,"Sub is less forgiving than sin, but more rewarding if you play it well, sin is more about luck than sub

that said, for mythic tos, sub beats sin in 8/9 fights, where sin comes out on top for avatar (feint+crimson vial solosoaking)",wow
67859,"Forget the haters. I thought the joke was hilarious. :)

I wonder where they get these... Do they just have a list of jokes to regurgitate when asked or are these water-cooler topics?",wow
67863,"I just want to point out [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/6os1vb/pve_tuning_changes_for_june_25/dkk4pxk/) comment from yesterday.

&gt;Only windwalkers if you wanna say they don't have a single better DPS spec, going ONLY by DPS, but really there are a lot of classes worse off all things considered.

&gt;Feral Druids are still not very good and telling them to play boomkin is basically like telling them to reroll. They want to play a melee spec, not a ranged. Oh and survival hunters because they still exist.

&gt;Then you have DK's/Enhancement shamans who do similar damage to rets, maybe 45k-80k more ST according to WCL Mythic Goroth at Max Percentile, but have far less utility and no immunity, which is obviously super important this tier.

&gt;When you take all that stuff into consideration, rets are actually the 3rd best melee DPS, only to be outdone by warriors and rogues, that both just got nerfed. No good guild cares about a DPS margin that small when you bring so much more to the raid. If it's a choice between a ret vs warrior/rogue (before these nerfs) then yeah okay maybe the ret is benched. Ret vs. any other melee? Ret probably gets the raid spot.

&gt;Source: In a top 60 world 7/9M guild, already been benched for avatar (ret is benched too) and will be for KJ as well (ret won't be benched). Also, our ret was slotted for our mistress progress kill when I wasn't and would have been in for maiden too if he wasn't sick because tanks deaths are a thing on that fight, kings can be helpful, and rets do a ton more damage when they stack their damage CD's with the maiden buffs than most other melee classes.

&gt;TLDR: Ret's aren't really that bad.

&gt;Edit: Forgot about Havoc, but Havoc isn't very good either. They only really shine on maiden because they just hold their burst CD's for when they have the maiden buff and do insane damage. Otherwise their damage generally is lower than most melee and the only thing they have going for them is they can cheese some stuff with netherwalk.
",wow
67867,I HOPE that's what we get. Fucking shelve the universe ending doom and fel shit for a while. Also throw Illidan in the toilet,wow
67875,Sounds like you have never stepped into a Mythic raid if you think that's the case.,wow
67908,Actual wintrading grps achieve their mmr by scripting than queueing legit games.,wow
67912,"I thought that Level 25 was ""too high of a level to start over again""... it's not.

Take your time leveling; don't rush it. Mainly do quests. Don't queue as Tank or Heals until you get the hang of the game.",wow
67956,A lot of games make it illegal to datamine. A lot of games also make addons illegal. Just because Blizz does something that doesn't make it universal lol.,wow

68032,"&gt;You can always click the icon on the minimap, to teleport to the instance.

This, but I always queue as a tank so I pretty much know when my queue will pop and have never had this problem.",wow
68043,"Have you done vash'jir? It's rough. Trying to do 3d combat swimming just doesn't work as well. It's the reason vash'jir is widely disliked as well as a big reason for abyssal maw being dropped. So yeah, take out the swimming aspect and it has the potential to be liked. ",wow
68044,"Because the cleave damage is generally unwanted / padding, not actually useful. Frost does more pure ST damage.

Another annoying thing I've noticed is that when you're too far back running away from the explosion, your Frozen Orb will despawn before hitting the boss even though you're in range with abilities. ",wow
68074,"played war/druid.   hunter druid was always such a pain to play against.  had to coordinate eating the hunter traps (iirc it was the druid that we wanted to eat the trap for the warrior), often having to kill the pet so that druid could get out of combat to drink, etc. ",wow

68374,"I'm a enh shaman mythic raider and this is what I can tell you from my experience in legion.

As I have all the legendaries I am able to try out lots of play styles and these combinations are more powerful and fun for me to play with.

68654,"Well some people could explain it better than I could, but tanking mechanics aside, roar see too many uses in mythic raiding and no other tanks has anything even close to that utility. And paladin/dh are too likely to get rekt by melee hit when their mitigation is down, outside of that they are alright.",wow
68657,"The filling isn't complete looking. Linework was awful. Cool tat with meaning to you but it is extremely poorly done. 

Looks like your average tattoo done by a scratcher.

Was it free handed? There's easy to spot mistakes. Different widths on the s is the biggest to me. You're likely to have blowouts in the corners where they bared down to hard. ",wow
68669,"So because this is my first season actually raiding, trying to improve when others hold me back because they just keep leaving and wiping us when I have to tell them the mechanics, asking where to focus on, means I'm a shitter?

Thanks alot!",wow

68803,the legion soundtrack particularly is great. highmountain sets the absolute tone for the expansion for me.,wow
68805,"So many stories here are so intense! 

I'm just a guy with a very stressful job. I find that sometimes, when stuff is getting heavy at work playing a bit of WoW before going to sleep keeps me from actually seeing work-stuff when I close my eyes to sleep. I play about 30 minutes a day. I might go on some empty schedule Saturday grind every couple of months so I don't fall behind by much. That's about it. 

On a more personal note, I work in a highly competitive jock-like  environment where playing WoW would be frowned upon, so most people don't know I play WoW. ",wow

I'm not exactly looking to get into the M+ tournament this time around, but it's content I enjoy the most. Is there a tank that seems to particularly excel in M+ content? I'm leaning towards Druid or Monk.",wow
68856,"~~Not sure about add-on. But that would be a pretty easy weakaura to make. Could also just have it ping if the nameplate comes into view, using the same logic for nameplate scanning the explosive wa uses I would assume~~

68910,"You can do the pokemon trick. Also, many boss fights are incredibly consistant and give tons of XP, so people have worked out ideal carry comps and strategies. After you get your first few 25s, you can fill out a roster of maybe 15 or so pets and use them to carry all other pets. During pet battle week (bonus xp things) you can max a pet in just two battles.

But this isn't the only time that a dungeon storyline makes no sense to one fraction; namely the revamped Shadowfang Keep.

IIRC, there's only one dungeon experience that changes dramatically depending on the fraction. Halls of Reflection.",wow
68946,"You could split into groups and stay close to your healers and survive, which I'm pretty sure is how it was meant to be done, but the room isn't that big and you can just druid/hunter it, so everyone just does a free for all rush toward Illidan.",wow

68994,Exorcism in 2 shots. We sure ain't playing the same game.,wow
69003,"Could not disagree more. Tanks in my experience get a free pass from the community for all but the worst play. If they're so bad they're ruining the experience for everyone else, that's the only time I hear people criticize. Damage dealers on the other hand are under constant scrutiny for the need to pump out high numbers. Go look at the group finder and compare how many groups in the description state low dps will be kicked vs how many make any mention of tanking failures. There's a large disparity.

If you're using LFR as your basis, I would only say that content is a joke and nothing that happens there should be considered representative of real content. If you think damage dealers are just mashing buttons while the tanks are the ones working hard, you're playing a different game than I am.",wow
69005,"I don't see why Blizzard just doesn't add in some lazy options that they say they won't make to work with helmets, it's not like most of them do now anyways, plopping hair on a model should be really easy..",wow

 Are you taking requests by any chance?  &gt;:3",wow
69021,"Once you get to 60, dungeons get very repetitive. Quest your heart out from 60-80. Outland and Northrend and wonderful for questing, with plenty of choices. (Unlike Pandaria and Draenor, which are quite linear.)

But if you don't like a class at 60, you probably won't like it much more if you keep leveling it, because you have pretty much all of your abilities by then, and only a few talent choices to determine how to build your character.

 I highly recommend leveling a BM hunter or warlock for your first class. Dying really sucks, and without heirlooms, having a pet tank for you is a godsend.",wow
69047,"I mean, I agree with playing what you enjoy. 

But Enh and Ele are very different in terms of damage capabilities and playstyle. ",wow
69055,Female orc mage isn't bad. They look a tad fat in robes though.,wow
69062,"Has any other healer never been blamed when someone dies from avoidable damage?

All the pugs I've grouped with either take responsibility or don't even say anything. Most of the time I'll tell them what was avoidable and how they can avoid it next time.",wow
69144,why exactly should i be hyped about a kul'tiras expansion though? i sort of expect something along the lines of old gods or void lords.,wow
69155,"8/9 H Shadow / Holy Priest here. I will say right now that I have little experience playing holy pala, and without any logs I have to assume that your difficulties aren't due to you badly playing or gearing yourself. 
If you use Skada / Details, you can look if the raid damage isn't coming from Dissonance, if it is, it's not your fault, the raid is simply taking avoidable damage, and they should start to separate in the 2 sides of the room. If it isn't, it might be because of the Templar's shockwave : these are dogeable, and should be. 
Finally, if you are not comfortable mana-wise, you should ask the whole spirit realm to switch to corporal during wailing souls, only leaving the non-withering heal and the tank in spirit. If you cannot do this due to the nature of pugs to not try different strategies / even following a strat, I highly suggest you try a 4 healer setup, I find it much easier on healers and gives you much more space to work with.

69252,I find people that can't handle a line of text on their screen annoying.,wow
69283,"Tbh, I was in legion beta and when I leveled for the very first time (with DH, so some more novelty) i was flabbergasted at how...immersive it felt. Legion leveling felt more like a story-driven single player RPG than any other expansion by a lot.  

I don't know why, but it somehow is also a huge chore to do more than once. Draenor was fine to do multiple times to a point, but I  barely even wanted to level a second character to 110. ",wow
69304,The old deathadder from 2011 is amazing. It's their newer stuff that sucks.,wow

69466,"Same story here! 

It was during WotLK, I was 13 or 14 at the time. I was really good at school but I've always been introverted and sensitive, and got bullied in a new school I had to transfer due our family moving. I have always found it difficult to get any close friends, so I got depressed. Wow, besides music was something I could hang onto. Over the years my depression got better and worse, but I still kept playing Wow more or less. Wow also helped me to find the area of my studies, game development, where I found my first true friends. 

A year ago I hit a rock bottom, was seriously pondering ""to die or not to die"", but finding people to play Wow again kept me afloat (among some other things). Now I'm doing pretty good, have an active Wow subscription, good medication and a bf who plays Wow as well (though he plays as a Gnome but I guess it is... okay... *sigh*). Azeroth for me is something special, I'll have always fond memories of going with my mage and hitting the wolves with my staff in Northshire Abbey because I didn't know any better. Good times!",wow
69502,"What tank? Using ANY ability or item will remove the invisibility. Divine Steed will remove invisibility, savage roar (AOE movespeed buff from druid) will remove it, any leap or dash dh might have, rolling as monk, trying to mount up.

But sorting out your children, stopping for your dinner, going for a smoke means you are a bad person who cannot control their urges and schedule their life properly. If you cant control those things you shouldnt play a game which involves a schedule. 

And its not even the whole game. Just one tiny part of it. If you have a fucked up life with no boundaries and you are such a bad person your kids literally scream at you for attention or your cat or dog shits everywhere a. sort your life out b. consider doing battlegrounds.

Wow is a lot more open to the wider audience, it is smoother and very easy to handle by even elders. Being so user friendly because of logical and proper game design over ten years has made it that way. 

You also have lore, the art, the music and just generally the functions being objectively superior. You say ""for casuals"" but that isn't a game audience, or game target. Most WoW players are casuals, and they're on WoW and not Runescape. ",wow

At level 71? Do you mean dungeons?

It looks like you're picking up the right pieces of gear as you go.
