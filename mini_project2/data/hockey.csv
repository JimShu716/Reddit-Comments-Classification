1235,"The Wild and their goalies. A while back the Wild had a really old guy named Backstrom who recently went through stomach surgery, they had a rookie goalie in Kuemper, they picked up Bryzgalov when he finally got away from the shit show that was Philly, and they had a guy named Harding who was diagnosed with MS.

So the season ended and Bryz was in love with Minnesota. Like, Philly completely beat him down mentally and emotionally. You can go back and watch his interviews go from ""why you heff to be mad"" infectious happiness to [this](https://youtu.be/D89lN28MoGs)... so when he finally played for a team that didn't hang him out to dry and played in a city where people weren't accusing him of insane shit just to hear his accent he remembered why he loved hockey again. So the season ends and he's basically begging to go back to Minnesota and is saying in the media he will take a really cheap contract to do it. Meanwhile Darcy Kuemper is a rookie goalie who played like 17 games in the season and part of the first round of playoffs and his ELC contract was up. He basically had no career to speak of and absolutely no ground to stand on but he decided to play hardball. So instead of retaining his RFA rights and bringing Bryz back, they left Bryz out in the cold and signed Kuemper to a one way contract while they were at the bleeding edge of the salary cap. This whole sequence was baffling because they still had Harding who has a degenerative incurable disease and Backstrom who is fucking old in relation to planet Earth. So they bring back the rookie who has no guarantee on working out and they don't buyout either of the guys who are guaranteed to be on LTIR at some point.

This sounds like a recipe for failure, and it was, but holy fuck balls if you tried to say anything cautious about it. The Wild had a fierce downvote brigade that would hone in on any goalie discussion and fucking bury you for suggesting it's not a good idea to have two guys who are falling apart in your 3 headed goalie tandem. You would get your inbox bombed about what a moron you are for not understanding that, for the 8 and a half games a year when he's healthy, Harding was the second coming of Hasek. Or you're an idiot for not recognizing Kuemper is the future of the Wilds net and he will probably get his number retired by the time he leaves Minnesota. You also got the combined might of Wild fans and Philly fans talking shit to you if you suggest that maybe they should bring back the veteran goalie who is a known quantity and played well for them. Bryz was the reason the Flyers and the Wild both failed to win the Cup as far as anyone was concerned. Fuck his decent stats and solid play. The only place anyone would budge was admitting the stitched together Frankenstein corpse of Backstrom was probably done at the end of the year but nobody would admit he needed to be off the roster. 

All in all it was a super shitty time and is the sole reason I hate Wild fans and give zero fucks about their team ever experiencing success. ",hockey

It would have been nice to keep Backes, and losing him definitely made us a worse team. But he wanted term, and he got a lot of it. I think Armstrong is building for another cup window in 2-4 years, and paying $6 million for a ~37 year old Backes in a few years would really work against us.

Brouwer wasn't that great to start with, and it seems like he's only gotten worse this season. I think we dodged a bullet by letting him go. 

Elliott specifically asked to be traded, and losing him has given Allen a chance to step up and develop his game more. It also gives us an open goalie spot this/next year for one of our goalie prospects to move up.

It sucked to lose all three players at the same time, but I think Armstrong wants to build a cup window around Tarasenko's prime.

But he was the ""captain"" (he brought the pucks and the jerseys were his) and he was a nice guy and terrible player so we were excited for him. 

We start freaking out and one guy tossed his helmet on the ice. The ref, a real Napoleon type, gave him two minutes for delay of game and I think another penalty for incomplete equipment or some other bullshit. It was definitely a double-minor, I know that.  We argue our case, as eloquently and kindly as you'd expect, get at least one more bench minor and make zero headway in our queries about the romantic and sexual availabilities of the refs mother. 

This was with about 5 minutes to go in the third and we were down 9-5 so we were in total ""fuck it"" mode. 

So we collude on the bench. We make sure the guy with the hatty is on the ice when the game ends. The minute the buzzer sounds the guy on the far end of the box chucks his helmet as far as he can onto the ice. Then the guy at the near end chucks his. From there our helmets fly one after another onto the ice, alternating ends of the bench. The ref is screaming and blowing his whistle, gesticulating wildly and the only word he can enunciate is ""suspension."" 

We ignore him entirely, mob our teammate the triple goal scorer, and head through the handshake line. While we congratulate the other team on their victory, they congratulate us on our display of exuberant celebration and ref-baiting. 

And that is the only time (so far) I've doffed my headwear in recongition of a hat trick.

Epilogue: the league was going to uphold our suspension, but our opponent the next week was so furious about having their game cancelled they demanded we be able to play, or that the league reimburse the percentage of the league fee they were losing. The rink caved and we played. Napoleon was not our ref for the rest of the season. Not sure if that was his choice or not. ",hockey

13448,"Definitely the 2013 playoff run and the collapsed season after, Oh and the Next Collapsed season after.",hockey
13529,"I ranked them with a completely non-scientific equation of upside/readiness. 


1. Miro Heiskanen - projected as an elite two way defenseman in the mold of Duncan Keith/ Scott Niedermeyer/ Nick Lidstrom. His skating is amazing and he has great defensive vision. He transitions between zones extremely smoothly and is able to elude forecheckers better than anyone in our system except for maybe Honka. His biggest area of growth is offensive vision - while a good passer and shooter, he gets a bit more hesitant with the puck in the offensive zone and needs to make quicker more precise decisions. Played heavy minutes and put up 10 points as a 17 year old in the SM Liiga, and had great underlying numbers.

2. Julius Honka - I put him as two instead of one only because he'll probably slot behind John Klingberg, but many believe he will be even better. The Klingberg comparisons really end at European, right handed, offensive - minded dman. Where Klingberg uses elite vision to break out and create offense, Julius Honka uses elite skating, speed, and a heavy shot. While he has  great first pass out of the zone and exceptional vision with passing, he is an even bigger threat to escape the zone and open up space using his skating. 

3. Denis Gurianov - Probably the most offensively gifted player in the Stars' system, Gurianov had a tough Draft + 1 year where he was stuck way down on the depth chart of Lada Togliatti, the worst offensive team in the KHL. He still managed to put up a few points playing only a few minutes a night. He transitioned to the AHL last year where he put up 27 points. Those numbers don't pop at first glance, but he was absolutely buried on the 4th line and only started seeing PP and top line minutes in the last few weeks of the season as many other prospects were called up to the NHL. Gurianov has turned into a two-way force, earning time on the PK and in tough defensive minutes. The offense is there and growing, and he projects to have an awesome season in the AHL in the top 6 with skilled, scoring linemates. 

4. Roope Hintz - Drafted in the second round as a kind of 'Faksa-Lite', Hintz exploded on the scene two years ago during the Liiga finals, scoring a few very pretty goals. He went on to have a solid season in the Liiga this year - after missing the beginning of the season with injury, he put up 30 points in 44 games with HIFK, then went on to lead the Liiga in playoff scoring. Hintz has exceptional speed and is a very explosive player, he manufactures offense by creating rushes and opening up space using his skating, and he has a good shot and decent ability to finish in tight. He's a big body and can get in on the forecheck and cause a lot of havoc for defenders. He's also great in his own zone and can be trusted on the PK. 

5. Jason Dickinson - Dickinson was sidelined for the first quarter of last year when the mysterious injury virus hit the whole organization. Because of that, he took a step back offensively after coming back to the AHL, but started coming on strong towards the end, earning a call-up and scoring a nice goal in the NHL along the way. He'll start in the AHL again next year to really get his scoring back, and likely stick in the NHL by the end of the year. He's a big C/RW who has great playmaking ability and hands as well as a good scoring touch, and plays a very good two way game. Think Nick Bonino. 

6. Jake Oettinger - The top rated goaltender in this year's draft, Oettinger had a great year as the starter at Boston University, and basically singlehandedly beat UND in the NCAA tournament. He's big, yet mobile, and plays a very calm, mistake-free game. He doesn't give up big rebounds and doesn't scramble himself out of position. He projects to be a very good starter in the NHL, but that will take 3-5 more years. I put him this high on the list because his upside is tremendous, but goalies are voodoo.

7. John Nyberg - Smooth skating, young defenseman who plays for Frolunda in the SHL. Playing more and more minutes as he gets more experience and should be a big factor in Frolunda's upcoming season. We don't know a ton about him over here, but he's got crazy good vision, skating, and passing, so if he develops correctly he could be big for the Stars in the future.

8. Jason Robertson - Big frame and very good finishing skills in tight. He carried Kingston's offense last year in the OHL, putting up 81 points as really their only offensive threat. His first steps could use some work as he's not super explosive, but once he gets going he's a good skater. He has a great shot and knows how to make space for himself in the offensive zone.

9. Gavin Bayreuther - College FA signing after putting up 29 points in 30 games for St. Lawrence last year, he had 5 points in 15 AHL games in the spring. He's a smooth skating offensive dman who excels at moving the puck in the offensive zone and quarterbacking a powerplay. He should take on top 4 minutes and top PP minutes in the AHL next year and if he can round out his game and polish the offense a little bit, he could turn into a good contributor at the NHL level.

10. Niklas Hansson - Another smooth skating swedish offensive defenseman. In 2015 he was dubbed as one of the Stars' next hidden gems out of Europe, a potential Klingberg-Lite with good offensive instincts and silky moves. He got injured towards the beginning of last season (I think), and lost a lot of minutes when he came back into the lineup, only putting up 11 points in 46 games for HV71 Jonkoping of the SHL. However, he still has a lot of upside and a full healthy season getting 17-20 minutes per night should put him back on track to come over to the NHL in the next year or two.

The IIHF and Team Canada didn't care when Eric Lindros played while he was refusing to play for the Nordiques. I honestly can't see why they would ban someone who decided to walk away from his contract (assuming the team doesn't excuse that player's absence.)

For example:

* CGY has about $9.8M to sign 5 forwards.  Lazar and Bennett can very likely be had for less that $3.9M AAV, especially on a short-term bridge deal.  But the cost of this would be a second round pick and both players are better than a second round pick.
* NYI has about $9.4M to sign 2D and 1F and they are desparately trying to free cap space to re-sign Tavares. DeHaan could also be had a bridge deal.

He has so many reasons to be inducted that I won't even start listing and instead I'll just go straight for the major knock against him which is that he only did so good because he was playing for a good team, which is complete and utter bullshit. First, he also played for the Islanders and the Blues and still had a winning record with those teams. Look at what's happened to those teams since he played for them. Basically right into the crapper (not trying to knock you Islanders and Blues fans, just pointing out facts).

You may say that doesn't matter much because he played much more time for the Wings. To that I say you still have to play like a champion if you want to become one. Look as recently as last year and you can find plenty of examples. Luongo is one of the best goalies in the league and played for the President's Trophy winners, but god was he bad on the road in the playoffs. Bryzgalov, another excellent goalie, let in 4 or more goals every game in the playoffs this year and played for a pretty solid club. Point being, you don't just win because you're on a good team and even if you've done well in the past, it doesn't guarantee you'll win today. You have to go out and earn every win no matter who you play for or what your reputation is. That's what Osgood did.

The best way to break the trap in my opinion is to send a guy for a stretch pass behind the ""3"" going cross-ice over the blue to the strong side. This, if you're playing a good opponent, will force his man to either stay with him or force a D man up. *Then*, you soft dump behind the strong side D. This does two things: 1) forces that strong side D to have to turn his feet and try to beat out the forechecker (who used to be the guy going for the stretch pass), and 2) if they're well coached, the weak side D should go retrieve the puck for the strong side D, which causes the middle of the ice to be open for a short time before the strong side can recover to the back post. This also makes it so the opposing center either goes to help the D or picks up a man driving to the net. As the forwards, once that dump goes in and your first guy goes to beat the D to the puck he'll have three options: 1) continue the rim around to a weak side forechecker, 2) hit the guy driving the middle of the ice that the strong side D is now forced to cover, or 3) if he won the race to the puck to carry it behind the net and find the trailer or hit a late arriving Dman for a shot, because remember now the trap has everybody's feet down ice instead of watching the play. The trap is good. But it is easily beatable with speed and efficient forechecking. This is because the trap is passive and the opponents feet are usually flat relative to the forechecking team.",hockey

23846,"&gt;but comparing today's players to his points seems unfair.

I'm not aware of many (honest) people doing this. Cross-era comparisons are notoriously difficult; the prevailing thought seems to be comparing dominance over peers. So in that sense, it looks even more cherry for Gretzky, who obliterated every other top scorer/HoFer in his era, with only Lemieux coming anywhere close.

My view is that too many people ascribe scoring levels of the mid/late 70s-early 90s to all the pre-90s years and that just isn't accurate. Those years were complete anomalies in the history of league scoring, and though Orr, Esposito, the Bruins, Gretzky, the Oilers, the Islanders, and the Lemieux-era Pens helped raise gpg rates, WHA contraction/NHL expansion, European player migration, shifts in game strategy/equipment/training, and minor league systems all forced significant changes to scoring levels.

I'm no hockey historian, or knower of arithmetic, but a pet peeve is the simplified argument that typically accompanies any reflection on the league pre-1995. Wayne Gretzky played in the same league as Mario Lemieux, and Mario Lemiuex, who played in the same league as Steve Yzerman, who played in the same league as Peter Stastny, were all doing their best to score as many points as they could. Would we ever conclude that Stastny puts up 155 on a terrible Wings team and wins the Pearson over Lemieux? Would we ever conclude that if Yzerman had Oilers-era Coffey that he'd put up 199 points on a terrible Pens team? Is there anything to suggest that Lemieux would score 200 points (I gladly accept a 1 point swing!) more than once...nevermind 4 times?

From 81-82 to 86-87, Gretzky *averaged* **203 points**. As Bill O'Reilly might well say: ""*You can't explain that.*""

Anyway, all that to say, league scoring levels are driven by a multitude of factors, and yet, somehow, we always circle back to things being easier for certain players, despite said players spanning and dominating in multiple eras. So yes, I agree, that point comparisons are flawed. But at a certain point, when a guy *averages* **203 points** over 6 seasons, I think we're clear to draw a line. And that line is right there, at that 200 god damn points mark.

Methot - Klingberg

Lindell - Johns

Hamhuis - Pateryn

vs

Goligoski - Klingberg

Oduya - Demers

Benn - Jokipakka

So first difference is Methot vs Goligoski. Two totally different players, and while Goligoski is/was the better player, I think Methot's playstyle compliments Klingberg's better. Having a stay at home guy to let Klingberg go on his adventures rather than another offensive minded, mistake prone guy could be a huge benefit for Dallas, we'll have to find out.

Everything else is pretty even. Demers is a pretty big loss from the 15-16 team, and I don't think he has a direct replacement right now, but I think everybody else is relatively even in ability across the two defenses. So if the second defense can lead them to a conference title with Lehtonen/Niemi backing them up, what can a similar defense in the first do with Bishop backing them up? We'll have to see, but I think a similar defense with a much better goalie spells success in Dallas.

They had decent personnel (Backlund and later Frolik are both forwards who are defensive stalwarts) but the system was all about risky stretch passes and d-men joining the play left, right and center.

Similarly, wingers get basically zero credit when it comes to defense.  Marchand, in my mind, was the second best defensive forward this year.  The Selke is a centerman's award, which is stupid.",hockey

Having defensively deficient linemates hurts his advanced stats.

Third time was a Reading Royals game in 2014.  I usually go to Reading for a game or two, and in January, that was the case.  I had on my Hershey Bears Outdoor Classic hat that game, and at the end of the game, one of the Royals scored an empty netter to get his hat trick.  Threw my hat on the ice, then afterwords, I went to fan services to inquire where to get my hat back (thinking it was like Hershey).  Turns out they keep the hats, and every time I walk by the hat display on the concourse at Santander Arena, I still see my hat in the hat trick case.",hockey

Fuck Norm Green.  

It must be tough being the least popular team in Texas, but it’s understandable when you have to compete with the Cowboys, Spurs, Astros, and any high school football team.  

Your mascot is named after a color you made up. That is somehow dumber than retiring the Number 1 for your fans.  
 
Jamie Benn looks like a pudgy manchild who stopped puberty halfway through, and his on-ice behavior indicates as much too.  

  
Tyler Seguin's career is much like the Stars as a franchise; he won a cup with virtually no effort on the back of a team someone else built.  
  
Fuck Norm Green.  

 The Dallas Stars don't make Youth Sized jerseys because the CPSIA classified Stars jerseys as a choking hazard. Though it's hard to fit a 200 pound 8 year old into a Youth jersey anyway.  


Gary Bettman doesn't want to put a legitimate NHL franchise in Houston because then Dallas would want one too.  

  
Fuck Norm Green.  

  
Antoine Roussel makes Brad Marchand look like Johnny Gaudreau.  

 
You are the worst of the non-traditional hockey markets.  

  
It seems redundant to have introduced some goofy big-eared alien looking fucker when you signed Jason Spezza a couple months earlier.  

  
Norm Green is worse than Stan Kroneke.  

 
With the signings of Antti Niemi, Patrick Sharp, and Johnny Oduya, you guys basically became Blackhawks South. Except unlike Carolina, there's nothing endearing about your team, and people don't actually want you to succeed.  

  
2001 was a terrible year for American Airlines, namely due to a single, catastrophic event. On that fateful day in 2001, they tragically opened up a building with their name on it, that became home to the Dallas Stars.  

 
 Your Stanley Cup win only happened because of bad officiating. Buffalo was right.  


Fuck Norm Green.  


[“Hey Patrick, what am I now?” “Uh, stupid?” “No I'm a Stars fan!”](http://imgur.com/a/jUKio)  


The Dallas Stars, with their high flying offense, and terrible defense, have been compared to a car that is the front half of a Lamborghini, and the back half of a minivan. The car can still function, but it's hard to drive as it has no clutch.  

  
Jim Nill traded Jyrki Jokipakka, Brett Pollock, and a 2nd Round Draft Pick, for 23 games of Kris Russell, in which he got 8 assists, and a +- of 0.  


There’s the saying that goes “Shoot for the moon, and even if you miss, you’ll land among the stars.” With the recent signings of Martin Hanzal, Alexander Radulov, Marc Methot, and Ben Bishop, it’s seemed to take on another meaning. “Shoot for the Stanley Cup, and even if you fail to win it and are all over 30 years old, you'll get overpaid by the Stars.""


Fuck Norm Green.

* A soft cap would be bad for owners with internal spending limits (Ottawa, Winnipeg) as it decreases parity which is something the NHL has done nothing but increase over the last decade and a half. 
* It would be bad for fringe teams because revenue sharing wouldn't be as robust since overall profitability drops. 
* It would only benefit the top few players in the league while the NHLPA has historically had representation from and fought for the little guys.
* Perhaps most importantly, it would raise Escrow rates as teams would be consistently spending well above the 50% HRR split and would require more kickback from the players to be made whole. Escrow is at the forefront of what the NHLPA wants to change and is likely one of the largest contributors to why there will be a lockout. That's going to take priority.

* 1. Tampa, and my general dislike for them existed before they whopped our asses two years in a row in the playoffs, but has really developed into a pure hatred the past three seasons. It always seems that no matter how injured, beat up, and weary Tampa is, they always seem to find a way to win against us. I'm convinced that the entire Lightning team could get seriously injured in an accident (hypothetical, of course) and still go out on the ice and kick our asses. Tampa has beat the Red Wings 12 out of their last 13 matchups. It's definitely a sour grapes situation, and with Kucherov coming off a fantastic season and Stamkos healthy again, I have no doubt they'll have a really good upcoming season, but even with their supposed 'defensive struggles' this season, that didn't really seem to be a factor with their games against Detroit? 
* 2. Montreal, and to be fair, this is more an intense dislike for their fanbase. I just can't stand how ruthless and cruel they seem to be, especially towards their own players when they're underperforming. After their storied history and no other team coming anywhere close to their Cup wins, and with their current cup drought being their longest in franchise history, of course the fanbase expects greatness. But even with the Cup drought, they constantly brag about Price being the greatest goalie in the world like it's an absolute undeniable fact (you can't argue or debate or compare other goalies, it drives me up a wall, he's absolutely up there, I just feel he still has more to prove before you can give someone that title.) and I just honestly don't like their logo, or their jerseys, or their team name.

39639,"I really don't see how this is happening anytime soon (even within my lifetime).  I understand your improving technology point, but we are still *so far* from replacing the experience of watching a game in the arena with at-home tech.  Yeah VR will get you closer but the sounds, the energy, the atmosphere, is all so far away.

Also I have a hard time believing they can make even close to the $200-$500 in revenue ($100-$450 for a ticket, $50-$100 in booze and food), through TV alone. Especially with the direction these streaming services are having to go (cheaper, more accessible) with the rise in illegal options.  I understand the desire for a more technologically accessible product (and the revenue associated with that), but nothing replaces the experience or the revenue from attending games.",hockey

39655,"Currently $41.6 mil tied up in 7 players the season this contract expires. Pacioretty is not one of those 7 players and he will be due $7 mil a year or more. Let's call it $6.4 mil for an even $48 mil. If Galchenyuk is even close to the player we all hope, it will cost $7+ mil since you're buying all UFA years. $55 mil in 9 players is a hell of a commitment.

I think the phrase 'there won't be enough cap space' is accurate, but if you intend to re-sign him and Patches, it pretty much means everyone acquired/re-signed between now and then has to come in on budget deals. Even if the cap goes up $2.5 mil per year (which seems unlikely), you are talking about $27 mil to fill up over half a roster.",hockey

39852,"Im not overly sold on Mason as a goalie but winnipeg if they play to what they are capable of could make it from #3 in the central to a wildcard.

Wouldnt be shocked if Koivu has a bit of a down year and with Parise looking like he cant stay healthy now theyre gonna need the young guys to pick up the slack especially Grandlund Nino and Zucker. 

Dallas's defense isnt as sexy as Nashville's but if Bishop could do what Niemi and Lehtonen couldnt and keep them in games they are a lock imo for a spot. Only thing that sticks out is how old spezza is and that forwards age like milk when theyre 34-36

St.Louis I feel I dont know enough about their players to make a real statement

Nashville imo didnt really get better but they didnt really get worse. Losing Neal and Fisher sucks and Bonino has more of a rep as a playoff warrior over a regular season and Hartnell is 36. Their defense is still juicy as fuck though and RV still has room to improve.

Chicago is gonna be a one we all will argue over but I think they can still make the playoffs. Saad for Panarin is basically an 70pt player for a 60pt player with an allround better game for the team. Kane may not be in the Art Ross hunt but I think he can still be PPG since he already has been with no 2C and without a decent LW his entire career. Toews I think will get a decent boost offensively with Saad and could likely get 65pts. Murphy I never watched enough of him but I think playing with Keith can do him some good maybe not replace hammer but at least lessen the blow of it. What people seem to forget is Schmaltz, Hartman, Forsling will likely improve and be better than last season especially Schmaltz who was really good the 2nd half and helped Toews go on a tear. Kempny is also a advanced stats god according to hero charts and has been good when he played. Will have 5 million in cap space when Hossa is LTIR'd so they will likely add someone too.

&gt;Consistent with the authors' predictions, age differences in sensation seeking, which are linked to pubertal maturation, follow a curvilinear pattern, with sensation seeking increasing between 10 and 15 and declining or remaining stable thereafter. In contrast, age differences in impulsivity, which are unrelated to puberty, follow a linear pattern, with impulsivity declining steadily from age 10 on.

&gt;I've developed a pretty solid hatred for the Oilers. Mostly because I'm from Edmonton, and let me tell ya, the amount of ""fans"" that popped up and bought a shitty orange McDavid jersey and wore it around was unbelievable. It was like the Oilers have been everyone's team for the past few decades or some shit, but nope, everyone pops up, pretends like they watched the team since before last Tuesday, posts a couple of pictures of Rogers Place watch parties on social media, and pisses everyone and their dog off, but nobody says anything because everyone else is on the bandwagon too. I get that the team is good again and that's fun and all, but fuck if it wasn't shoved down everyone's throat for a month and a half. It wasn't unbearable or anything, but fuck, you'd think people who haven't watched hockey in their lives have better ways to spend their money than a jersey they'll wear twice, probably not realizing Adidas was dropping new threads on us two months later anyways. And then they'll all chirp the shit out of me for being a Wings fan because all of a sudden we're bad and they're good now, apparently the ultimate trump card. Yay.

&gt;Then there's the whole mismanagement draft lottery thing. I'm not a huge fan of the draft lottery like it was, but the Oilers singlehandedly ruined the draft lottery for every other team because of their idiotic management. Four first overalls later, and idiotic management which sent the city into a collective state of angst, and the NHL changes the rules. Who loses from that? Colorado, who got 4th overall despite being historically terrible; Buffalo, who got Eichel, but whiffed on other great talents; Vancouver, who are in a permanent state of 5th overall; Arizona, who haven't had jack shit compared to other teams in the draft, and just about every other team near the top of the draft lottery. Who doesn't lose from the rules specifically made to limit the Oilers? Well, you fuckin guessed it, it's the Oil. They just ride off into the sunset with Mc fuckin Jesus and continue to monopolize generational talent along with the Penguins, who deserve their own angsty rant that I'll save for another time.

&gt;On top of that, how can you cheer for some of the guys in the Oilers organization? Kevin Lowe ""knows a thing or two about winning,"" but helped drive the team and the city's collective morale into the ground. Darryl Katz has some weird sexual lawsuit, and strong armed the city into building the arena over the threat of dumping the Oilers in Seattle. Arena is nice, but fuck, even hardcore Oilers fans agree that taxpayer dollars shouldn't really be going to an expenditure which benefits that goof above all else. Like, fuck, his team was so bad, that the city of Edmonton basically collectively adopted his son when we saw him march up to the draft stage for a top pick every year. It was like watching your own child grow up or some shit man. Katz alone should probably keep any non-Oilers fan around here from liking the Oilers, so I guess I'll leave it at that until the next time I get into a Hall/Larsson debate and take the edgy, indefensible position that the Oilers maybe could've gotten more value in that deal. Yay once again.

Oh and one more peice of advice, the biggest hurdle for pain after surgery is the capillaries making new routes through incision as it heals. So if you keep your leg up too much, the blood pressure hurts too much when you put your leg down, so alternate and put your leg down frequently if you can handle pain. It will ease the transition in healing better. 

Also, I had my leg on the bed on its side, it stretched out my tendons so my leg flared out to side. Keep a pillow to keep your leg straight. It will save tones of physio! Otherwise your hip flexors will stretch longer than other side. 

And keep the pain managed so your body can heal without having to deal with pain. Don't worry about being addicted to pain killers. You can wean yourself off when you're ready. You are a hockey player. So you are tougher then most men!

Toronto burned assets to add goalies who then failed to perform. The only difference is that to bring our goalies, we burned picks, which killed our prospect pool. Phili retained the prospect pool, but man did they burn cap space.

Instead you're advocating for retaining an aging defenseman who could get seriously injured or just flat out choose to retire in the next year or so. 46 points is really good but I wouldn't say that justifies his spot on the team when you could easily dump that into offensive depth alone and at the very least double your point production for that given $5 mil of cap. Also, I'm not assuming his point production drops in half, but you see it with older defenseman, they get slower, injuries pile up and younger guys start to outpace and eventuallyreplace them. Isn't one of the Hawks main point of criticism over the last few years that they gave put lavish contracts after there first couple couple cups in order to reward the core players?

Ask- ""how can leave this camp a better player than when I came in?"" Learn from adversity but don't let it define your success or failure. 



Use the camp as a chance to see what you need to focus on, think about your mistakes and what you can do differently. Maybe ask the coaches what they see. Maybe ask some of the nicer players if they have any tips. 



For the scrimmage - accept that you will make mistakes and that some people might talk shit. But don't let that fact weigh you down, just focus on trying your hardest. Keep your game simple, concentrate on a few key aspects that you will try to execute to perfection (like making sure your skating is in good form even when you're tired, or tape to tape passes, or a quick release). 



Just remember that this camp is just one week in a much longer hockey journey that's going to continue for many, many years. And more importantly it's just one week in your life. You have an exciting road ahead where you'll continue to grow both as a hockey player and as a person. ",hockey

3. Vegas needs to sell tickets and prove that it can succeed. There will definitely be pressure from the league to put butts in the seats and prove Vegas is a viable destination. Trading everyone and purposefully icing a historically bad roster would get some heat from Bettman and around the league.
4. No team is going to give you picks at the threatening of an offer sheet, especially knowing that Vegas is going to have top 5 picks for the next few years and would be moronic to lose those in an offer sheet.

This leaves us with about $25 million for Tavares' contract and Nylander's extension, which sounds like a lot until you realize that the following season we have Marner, Matthews, and Kapanen coming off their ELCs, Gardiner is a UFA and there is still another year on Marleau and Martin's contracts.

Its definitely a possibility. If management is confident in their pipeline they can go for it in 2018 Chicago style.

**Team has to be in win-now mode**. This one is the easiest - you're not trading for Ovi to rebuild.

*Eliminated:* Detroit, Vegas, Vancouver, Philadelphia, Colorado, Florida, Buffalo, New Jersey, Carolina, and Arizona (NOTE: I think Carolina and Philadelphia are going to be competitive this year, but their window is still opening as opposed to closing).

*Remaining:* Toronto, Chicago, Dallas, Anaheim, LA, St. Louis, Rangers, Montreal, Tampa, Islanders, San Jose, Calgary, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Pittsburgh, Columbus, Boston, Minnesota, Edmonton, Carolina, Nashville.

**Must be looking for offense.** Ovechkin is likely an improvement over the vast majority of top 6 wingers, but given the assets that you'd give up to get him, you need big improvements (e.g. - while Ovi would step in and be the best winger on the Penguins without question, the Pens aren't hurting for offense to the point where adding him becomes a true need.

*Eliminated*: Detroit, Vegas, Vancouver, Philadelphia, Colorado, Florida, Buffalo, New Jersey, Arizona, *Toronto, Chicago, Dallas (given offseason moves), Tampa, Islanders (although he could be a huge help on the PP), Winnipeg, Pittsburgh, Columbus, Minnesota, and Edmonton.*

*Remaining:* Anaheim, LA, St. Louis, Rangers, Montreal, San Jose, Calgary, Ottawa, Boston, Carolina, and Nashville.

**Must have the cap space to eat this contract in the near term.** Cap space is key because Washington isn't going to take on dead money/retain at ton given their own concerns. I specify near term because these teams that are in win-now mode are going to be willing to deal with the term and a potential albatross later.

*Eliminated:* Detroit, Vegas, Vancouver, Philadelphia, Colorado, Florida, Buffalo, New Jersey, Arizona, Toronto, Chicago, Dallas (given offseason moves), Tampa, Islanders (although he could be a huge help on the PP), Winnipeg, Pittsburgh, Columbus, Minnesota, *Edmonton, Anaheim, LA, Rangers, Montreal (looking toward that Carey Price contract kicking in next year), San Jose, Calgary, Nashville (tons of space now, but looking at Arvidsson and Ryjo RFA), and Boston (Pasta RFA contract coming).*

*Remaining:* Ottawa.

So I'm left with one team - Ottawa. For the sake of argument, I'm going to assume that Eugene has given the okay to foot the bill for the deal. I'm going to assume that Washington would be looking for help on the back-end, a roster forward, and picks. I think Thomas Chabot would be the center-piece that Washington would want, and then I would add 2018 1st, and Ryan Dzingel.

I moved out of Chicago to the middle of the country 4 years ago. Hockey isn't a big thing here. Well, 2 seasons ago it was game 7 of the Blackhawks/Blues series and I am sometimes in the Blues market. I turn on NBCSN where the game was being aired nationally and there was a premier league soccer rerun on. I was confused to I thought maybe it was on FSN-MW as the Blues sometimes aired on there and I was in their market so I switched and they were playing UFC and then the Royals. Okay, I was really lost now. I have NHL.tv but they don't play playoff games unless you're basically out of the US or using a vpn. I asked my cable company and they said the local NBC affiliates decided to air a rerun of a fucking soccer game on NBCSN instead of a game 7 NHL playoff game. So that game was completely blacked out in my state. Like, what the actual fuck!? I cancelled my cable after that because I was so mad. Not airing the games, especially when they are nationally aired definitely doesn't help grow the game. 

I was paying crazy money to have the NHL Network for when the Hawks were aired on there and I couldn't watch on NHL.tv if I didn't want to VPN, and I had every sports channel that offered any hockey. Plus NHL.tv. Yet, I was completely blacked out of a big playoff game. Yeah, that'll get us more fans!",hockey

66439,"&gt; These are more ""prestigious"" guys too

The examples you gave were of players that weren't good by year 2 of their deals, if they were ""prestigious"" players it was in name only. Thats more about the nature of NFL free agency, the artificial dollars teams throw at players that they will never see with shit like offset language and performance bonuses that would see you become the best player at your position before you see a dime of a bonus, If these players you picked were better than an average starter with a bloated contract they would have gone and signed elsewhere for the vet minimum. Kruger and Edwards toiled around with a couple teams but never saw the field again, Baker was done and cooked. You're presenting this to me like I have no knowledge of NFL contracts or the players who received them, I'm an avid NFL fan and well aware of the downfalls of their system, but I thought you'd pull better examples like DeSean Jackson getting cut for not getting along with Chip Kelly, and the lack of protection present in the language of the contract that would have made the Eagles think twice about just dumping a good player in his prime. 

The equivalent to those guys are Ville Leino, or Christian Erhoff who signed big deals, were bad under them, and were bought out by the Sabres within 3 years of signing them. Leino got 10/15M owed to him on top of 12M in salary in 3 years. Erhoff got 18M in bonuses and 14.6M from the remainder of his contract. Leino got 22M total for 2 years, Erhoff got 32.6M for 3 years. Without the recapture for the players, it's admittedly not close, NFL players net more in a shorter period of time, but it's more similar than I expected before I calculated what each was paid. However, the recapture still I would argue does not go far enough because it pays that 2/3 of the contract over double the amount of term left on the contract. Erhoff see that 14.6M over 14 years, and Leino gets his 10M over 8 years, over which time inflation occurs and makes that sum of money less and less over time in a compounding nature. But in summary, NFL money vs. NHL money, NFL money is higher/bigger numbers and with that comes earning potential (what we all strive for) with the trade off of security while NHL money is definitely more secure but far fewer dollars and far less earning potential. 


&gt;I'm admittedly not too familiar with the NHL's contract system but it looks like buyouts still pay out 33% of your salary if under 26 and 66% if over, on top of the full signing bonus. That's way better than for NFL players who get a big fat 0 outside of their signing bonus.

Your understanding of the NHL buyout system is 100% correct, but your conclusion that it's way better than the NFL system is misguided IMO. I just ran those numbers for you up there, compare them to the Kruger, Edwards, Baker example you gave and you still have those guys getting almost 1/2 or 2/3 of their deals in 2 years or less. That's still significant and deserves to be acknowledged. 

The other variable in this is how the players negotiate those deals. Some players trade that security for earning potential, and some guys sign the Suh deals and put their teams in a crunch after year 1 because of guaranteed $ (i take no issue with Suh doing it, but it is a fact). I can remember the Ricky Williams Saints contract had performance bonuses that meant he would have had to match or beat Walter Payton's best season before he got the full value of his contract and bonuses, while the PB's below that were still 1500 yards and 12 TD's and just gaudy numbers. This was his ROOKIE deal. If teams have a guy that's willing to sign that, should we legislate that they can't? And does that reflect on the Player's union because the player took a bad deal for himself. I don't see how contract negotiations reflect back of the any leagues PA, that occurs between the agent, player, and team. 

&gt;As far as revenue sharing, looks like the NHL players get 50% while NFL is at 47-48%

Thank you, appreciate you sharing that info.

&gt;I did (mistakenly) think that NHL contracts were fully guaranteed, so it's not quite as lopsided as I originally thought, but they still have a much better parachute than NFL players.

Not like you were far off, I knew what you meant by it. They definitely have a better parachute than most NFL players, but if those NFL players actually negotiated for more security, they could be just as well off. Trade some of the 30 million dollars you'll never see on the base salary and turn it into 15 in roster bonuses in late April and we wouldn't see these actually good football players being dumped after the draft or late in FA.",hockey

- Interpretation 1: When an NHL club loans a player to the AHL, the AHL team now has the power to choose how to manage that player. They can give him first line minutes, or sit him in the press box. With that in mind, while the player is on the AHL roster, they're within their rights to loan him to a national team instead of playing him in the AHL.

- Interpretation 2: The AHL team only controls the player at the discretion of the NHL team, since it is the NHL team that signed him to the contract, so the NHL team retains the right to make that decision. 

At the end of the day, obviously both teams would be involved in any decision to send a player overseas, but the distinction on who has the right to release/loan a player who is on an NHL deal playing in the AHL is still interesting. For example, I could see NHL teams being interested in loaning out some of their young prospects to play in the Olympics, and pushing Interpretation 1 as a way to make that choice themselves.

Do you not agree Tampa should be better next year? Do you not see it as a possibility the leafs will be better as they improved their team this offseason and if they can win only half their shootouts from last seasln they will be a 100+ point team (you can fact check that one if you'd like)  

Montreal, and Ottawa are equal in my mind with Boston a hair behind. Its not hard to see why Montreal with a few new players and losing their top offensive player and potentially one or their better D in addition to an already aging Weber will not yield the same results as last year.

Secondly, The deal was Reaves and pick #51 for Sundqvist and pick #31. You make it sound like we didn't get a pick. 

Now, here's the thing. The Pens drafted Zachary Lauzon at #51. If we never made a deal and kept pick #31, reports outta Pitt are that we would have taken Lauzon ANYWAYS. We had our eye on him. Although I'll admit it was sheer luck that he was still available by that point.

So basically, from Pitt's perspective the deal was Reaves for Sundqvist straight across. That's a deal I'd make any day. Sundqvist was spare parts and doesn't provide much of anything. Reaves adds a physical dimension, is a loved guy in the room and his work ethic is off the charts. We have to protect our stars.

The trade was a win-win for both parties. The Blues got to pick higher and Pittsburgh got tougher while not losing anything of value.",hockey

Unfortunately, there's no way of telling how well a team will do. Last year /r/hockey was sure it was Washington's year.. or Dallas's year.. in 2015-2016 everyone LOVED the panthers and now /r/hockey is calling them irrelevant again.

Edit: In general, I think it's highly variable, and the simplest explanation is luck. Someone who is concussed after being on the receiving end of a dirty hit two years in a row is ""unlucky"" in that they were on the ice at the same time as the player who decided to make an illegal hit, but that doesn't mean they're genetically more injury-prone than someone who played all 82 games both years but was never hit with a cheap shot to the head.

Then came Pekka Rinne, in the height of my goaltending, after following JSG who got me into goaltending, I couldn't not be enamored with the guy. I'm still not even in TN, I'm in KY only an hour away, but it's the hometown team. I grew up following more teams because I had to take what was on TV.

The Hurricanes re-acquired Justin Williams and brought in Scott Darling, and have Skinner and some other pieces (Aho, Rask) to make things happen if they can get an elite scorer.
