75,"I'm not just talking about the world. The core of Fate/Stay Night is Shirou and how his character develops, ideals questioned, as he goes through three different journeys in it's three routes. Fate/Zero keeps to that core because it is a direct prequel to Fate/Stay Night. They are the main entries of the series.

Fate/Apoc does not explore that aspect of the series in any way, because it's just a bunch of action. Yes, there are people that watch Fate/Zero and Fate UBW for the fights, but those people aren't really the ones that appreciated and really liked Fate, the ones that are actually invested in the franchise.

Your point that Fate/Apoc is supposed to be appealing to non-Fate fans is the direct opposite of my point. My point is that Fate/Apoc is a terribly entry point because it has little of what most people like about the main series content. It's literally a spin-off that, like I keep repeating, is just trying to be schlock action.

I really like his arc throughout the show. I also love at how the show builds its setting and hints at minor characters having lives and personalities that we don't actually see.

366,"Obligatory first time watcher, first rewatch thread, posted in most of the threads so far.

Crunchyroll's subtitles kept screwing up so I missed some of the dialogue, and watching the episode was a bit more frustrating than usual. I still enjoyed it, mostly.

At the beginning of the episode, we see that the girls' hard work has already started to pay off - actual recognition, a delay in shutting down the school, and a bump in their space. I imagine that Eli had something to do with this - in an earlier episode it seemed that the student council had considerable control over clubs. Even if they don't have explicit control, she's obviously got it good with the Director. From what I've gathered from other anime and from what the internet says, clubs are accountable to faculty advisers, but the student council seems to have a lot to do with organization.

Honoka genuinely is a force of nature. They see her coming and just know that there's nothing they can do but accept the glomp.

Umi makes it sound like Maki doesn't have a good head on her shoulders. Don't you do that to best girl. Like, pretty much every episode she's pointing out all the hurdles they still have to cross and shutting down people who are going to far. And Maki, what are you doing with Nico? No, girl, you've got so many better options.

I love how they just straight-up call out how yuri-baity Eli is, with Honoka's long, lingering evaluation. And I can't imagine that it's a coincidence that they flash the episode title - ""Wonder Zone"" - while the camera lingers on her legs and thighs (I know that it's actually the song about Akiba, but I can't imagine that the juxtaposition wasn't intentional. Nico getting mad that she's obviously not on Eli's level (in casual clothes *and* in the maid outfits), and then Nozomi making sure her waifu doesn't get to uppity, just adds to the comedy. It was just a really well-directed scene.

The trip to the school idol score just sounded straight-out pornographic. Hanayo and Rin need to keep it in their pants a little. And Nico is yet again causing trouble for people because she's putting the cart before the horse. Lady, you'll be hot shit at some point, and you're on your way there if you work really hard, but you don't need to be making everyone dress like a chilly asthmatic.

When I saw that Rin was legitimately fooled by Kotori's foreigner ""ruse,"" I immediately understood how she was failing in school. Everything immediately made sense. Also, Eli's face at that was absolutely priceless. Like, yeah, yeah, her heart is all melted and stuff, but she's constantly reminded that she's surrounded by idiots.

GODDAMN IT NOZOMI STOP GRABBING OR THREATENING TO GRAB PEOPLE'S TITS WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU? I thought Nico was the pro stalker, but Nozomi taking it to a new, rapey level is just... Jesus, somebody call the cops. Please. She's got some redeeming qualities but I'm 90% sure that the signs on subways about reporting improper sexual contact are because she's going around going washi-washi on all the women. Gross.

Kotori's attempts at writing lyrics remind me of Mio's lyrics from K-On, except that Kotori's both worse at it and knows that she's not very good. I mean, both are good and wholesome girls but there's only so much you can write about things being cute and fluffy.

Also, Kotori is legitimately adorable in her maid outfit - she's pretty cool otherwise, too, and very athletic, but working in a maid cafe suits her well. I almost understand why maid cafes are popular in Japan now. But I will never understand why Japanese people are comfortable with ruining a perfectly lovely omurice with... blech... *ketchup*. Related to that is Kotori's admonishment that Umi needs to keep her smile on even when she's backstage - retail and customer-service employees have to do a lot of ""emotional labor"" to pretend to be happy in order to make other people feel good. I'll tell you, it's exhausting.

Honoka-Umi-Kotori lesbian poly triad is now canon.

On a fashion note, in addition to Nico having a casual outfit that looks a lot like a more straightened-out version of Honoka's top, Rin seems to have the same thing going on. I bet that's been the case this whole time and I just haven't paid attention. I thought I saw the same thing going on with Nozomi, but closer inspection makes me think that she's got a halter top or something like that underneath instead of a tank.

Cultural notes: While watching, as soon as I saw that picture of Kotori, I thought she must have had something to do with selling all of that unlicensed merchandise, so her being a maid cafe performer came out of left field. But maybe Japan has a less stringent legal perspective on copyright and image rights. I can't imagine being able to have a massive doujinshi market in the United States or most Western markets, but obviously that scene flourishes in Japan.

On a detail note, when Eli said goodbye to Umi and Honoka, she was turning into a street with a sign saying ""Matryoshka."" I went down the rabbit hole for a bit on researching Russians in Japan and the influence of the Russian Orthodox Church, but Eli's family isn't particularly special. Her grandmother *might* have been the child of refugees from the Russian Civil War, apparently called in Japan the ""White Russians."" That would also explain, timeline-wise, why Eli's family went back to Russia during her childhood and the post-Soviet reforms, and then why they'd head back in time for school with the increasingly unstable political situation and economy.",anime

Chris, Shirabe, and Kirika use a pretty natural vibrato...and are about in that order of how often they use it. Chris was raised in a family with a lot of music, so it makes sense thst she had a little natural spin to her voice. Shirabe has a very level and pure sounding tone, sort of matching her idealism with these very beautiful vocal vibratos occasionally..while Kirika, the hot topic Edgelord that she is, sacrifices it for some other vocal tricks. The kicker is...Hibiki. Uses almost none. In the first season, I don't think she has any vibrato at all. But she's the only one that literally has a relic buried inside her body.

1722,"God damn I hate the alarmist attitude people have about pirating anime. ""You gotta support the industry guys or anime will disappear!"" No it fucking won't. Anime studios make their money by selling a few thousand expensive blu-rays to only the most hardcore fans of their show. Kyoani won't go broke because you pirated K-On instead of watching it on CR. They'll go broke if otaku's stop buying the blu-rays. The fact is we don't even know where the money CR gets goes, because they won't tell us. It probably goes to pad their own wallets and pay production studios for licensing so they can continue to rob western anime fans of their money over moral high grounds. Japan doesn't even give a shit about the rest of the world anyway so what does it matter.

I'm not saying we shouldn't support the industry I'm saying that giving CR money probably isn't doing it. At least not very much. If you really want to support the industry buy merch or blu-rays. At least there you know where your money goes.",anime

2299,"Hi!

&gt; Tell me more about that

I can only talk about this two last episode, since the others I don't remember almost nothing. Yup, it really just passed through me.

The first of the two last episodes [had](/s ""the girls fighting a gigantic monster, a Kamikui it seems, like their were Power Rangers. From them piloting a gigantic robot to fight it, that robot getting out from a mountain through an hidden gate, to after getting out of energy they use their life enrgy to defeat the monster"")

The other was a budget cut episode, [an excuse probably](/s ""to get some shots from the girls in compromising clothes or positions, before they learning that the big monsters that they had defeated were back, and the other girl and the guy were getting their asses kicked by them. Ends with a possible next season? NO!"")

The guy talked through those game text boxes, and I remember a episode of a convenience store in the middle of a storm. Just this, I barely remember anything else from this show.

&gt; I remember that WT! I will have to watch that someday, it looks so random.

Until now, I am enjoying it quite a lot. Gonna see if I finish it before catching some ZZZ's.

Exactly, but in this case I think is more do to the unknown of when the next volume will come out.

2459,"Some of the more ""Japanese"" shows honestly feel like completely different shows between English and Japanese. 

Because of my learning process, I actually don't know what its like to watch anime as a learner, I only have the experience of watching it with almost no Japanese experience and watching it as a fluent speaker. 

I'm digging through my MAL now to see if there's anything that stands out.

1) Evangelion. Shinji's character and relationship with his father are much closer to home for a lot of Japanese families. Also, a lot of the lines have double meanings (I think most people remember the double meaning when Asuka says ""I feel sick"" at the end, but that line has like 4-5 possible interpretations in Japanese, ranging from ""I feel like I'm going to vomit"" to ""You're a piece of shit, Shinji.""

2) FLCL: Again, this plays really heavily on Japanese family dynamics. Also the show sounds really dirty when you watch it with your eyes closed (intentionally, of course). That can't really carry over into the subtitles and the dub tries, but only captures some of it. 

3) Azumanga Daioh: Osaka's character (and Osakan characters in general) make way more sense when you're familiar with the dialect. A lot of the puns as well just don't carry over. Fortunately since it trends towards the absurd, the physical humor stays the same. One bit I remember in particular is the mamechishiki bit, where Osaka (iirc) is sharing mamechishiki, which in Japanese is like little weird facts (this is where mameshiba comes from), but instead keeps sharing facts about beans, which can be read as mame no chishiki. I think the subtitles make it ""grains of truth"" versus ""truth about grains"" but it's not nearly as funny because it doesn't feel as natural.

4) Samurai Champloo. I think Jin's Japanese VA plays the character better, but the English Mugen is waaaay better. With a bit of a background in Okinawa you start to see why that's the case, since Mugen is supposed to be from Okinawa. There's also the whole bit about Mugen learning to write that makes much more sense in the Japanese (Mugen writes a sideways eight on the building, mugen means ""infinite."") 

Some series I realized actually just have bad writing and I can't watch at this point (Blue Gender), some series I realized that it wasn't that the translation was bad, it was that the script was bad (can't think of an example, but one will come to me.)",anime

The price, however, for the point was expensive reaching 100.000 private points, the MC not having that much of money hesitated for a bit, then Horikita came telling the teacher that she, Horikita, and Ayanokouji would pay the price of the point together, thus ending with no money but having bought that one point needed for Sudou to pass.

* Aha, found the comment face in the OP [](#kotori)

* Honoka and Kotori are both lovable dorks.

* So I guess they’re going to be called the μ’s, but as an engineering major, all I can think of is the metric prefix for micro.  It also doesn’t help that Muse is one of my favorite bands either.

* This episode make me go check to see if I could still do pushups.  Barely got to 20…

* Actually, that’s a very good point.  What if they suck during the performance?  That could actually put the school in an even worse position.  Never thought of that myself until she said it.

* Idol music just sounds weird without all the hype and synth behind it.  Maki still sounds great though, albeit a bit autotuned and processed if anything.

* Either that’s just the ED or they literally just recruited everyone through one montage.  It’s probably the former, but that’s...um...hmm...

* I feel like I’m gonna love the girl with the maracas in the ED.  She looks like she’s having so much fun.

* First live already?  Dang.  Though the Idolm@ster had their first live by Episode 3 as well, so who am I to judge?

* Overall, nice episode today.  I adore the character interactions between the main trio.  Goofy antics always get me.

* [**Gunsmith Cats**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/650/Gunsmith_Cats) - highly recommended 3-episode OVA from the nineties. Lots of gun fights and some animation that blows TV anime out of the water
* [**Sabagebu!**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/20709/Sabage-bu) - about a survival game club. Technically airsoft but they certainly play it like it's real.
* [**Gungrave**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/267/Gungrave) - Don't know too much about it but it's a little older, fairly well received show about mafia-type stuff and has gun in the name, so I imagine it's a good place to look.
* [**Golgo 13 (2008)**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/4039/Golgo_13_TV) - modern version of a classic manga about a hitman. It's long and idk the ratio of good gunfights it'll have but it's bound to have something.
* [**Chrno Crusade**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/60/Chrno_Crusade) - 
* [**Gunslinger Girl**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/134/Gunslinger_Girl) -

* [**Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5682/Phantom__Requiem_for_the_Phantom)
* [**Maxlax**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/252) - 1/3 of Bee Train's ""girls with guns"" trilogy
* [**Noir**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/272/Noir) - 2/3 - more noir/spy themed
* [**El Cazador de la Bruja**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2030) - 3/3 - Western themed
* [**Black Cat**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/68/Black_Cat)
* [**Shigofumi**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/3420/Shigofumi)
* [**Canaan**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5356/Canaan) - not my personal favorite but it has some good action and plenty of fans
* [**Upotte!**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12317/Upotte) - the girls are literally anthropomorphized guns. I hear it's not super good, but if you're a gun otaku it might be fun. It may be primarily SoL rather than action though. Just thought I'd throw it out.
* You dropped [**Outlaw Star**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/400/Seihou_Bukyou_Outlaw_Star), but that has some good gun stuff. Why'd you drop it?

Then spend several episodes (or a movie) on a pared-down version of the 3rd's main story, focusing on Kevin &amp; Ries and skipping anything that isn't integral to that arc.

The only character other than Kevin &amp; Ries who really gets meaningful development in the main plot of the 3rd is [TitS 3rd](/s ""Renne""), so you could truncate the story pretty well without losing anything important as long as you adapted the Door stories separately.

&gt;And that's an easy way of saying that the medium is already laughed at by the majority of people, what is another awful, weird, perverted piece of trash to the already negative stigma.

That's not the only reason anime is still stigmatized today. It's a combination of the previous generation not understanding that hand-drawn animation can show a complex and mature story, and the general ""japanese are weird because I automatically believe that their weirdest shit is common amongst them"" mentality. Hentai didn't help either in creating a positive picture about anime. Compared to these, trashy harem shows don't contribute as much to the stigma as you think. Most people who hold up this stigma don't even know these shows exists.

&gt;You didn't call them stupid, but you somehow implied that when it became about incest it is somehow worse than the already inherently sexist bullshit that is harem.

I did not want to imply that it became worse. Probably something has gone missing in translation (English is not my first language). I wanted to express my distaste of having an acceptable background story and setup sinked in order to give more ground to the siblings', at the very least, questionable relationship. As for the harem genre: I do not find the setup bullshit. I find it something well within in the borders of disbelief - I know it's unrealistic and 99% of the time it's a power fantasy intended for the audience, but it's not impossible in terms of reality. This is why I can't really describe it as a sexist genre, either: it's blatantly obvious that these girls (or guys, let's not forget about reverse harems) don't exist in real life and they are not intended to be a example to be followed, but they still don't break my suspension of disbelief, and I do believe that it's the same for the majority of the watchers of the show.

&gt;However, there are plenty of series out there that do what Eromanga does but better, maybe not a lot better, but better. At least those shows have a modicum of storytelling and character development that actually affects the flow of the narrative. Why not watch those? That way you are promoting entertainment that at least has some value to this looping industry.

It was not my intention to defend Eromanga-sensei over other shows even in the same genre. I was not promoting it either. I just said that I liked it. Look at this thread: the original theme is about shows that are popular on this subreddit, but the original posters of the show have a disagreement about this. That's where I wrote my shortened experience with the show. I did not recommend it, nor did I asked people to not watch it. Actually, I have another comment in this thread about Kuzu no Honkai and even when I have strong negative feelings about the show, I stayed neutral in it's recommendation. 

&gt;I don't look for different things in different pieces of entertainment. I look to be entertained. That's it. If i'm not entertained then I can analyse why.

That's perfectly fine, but...

&gt;However, genres really don't have much to do with that.

Yes they do. Genres have a different set of tropes which are to be used, discarded, subverted, etc., and as such give us the story. But you can't have the same valueing system for two different sets of tropes. That's like complaining about a marble statue not being colorful enough.

&gt;Studios really don't matter. They don't. Some have their signature trademark or directors and that's great and they can bring their own personal touches to otherwise over-done ideas.

Yeah, I should have said that studios don't really matter in a meaningful way, but since there is difference in experience staff and overall style between them, it's important to mention them as a factor, even as a small one. For example, Inferno Cop and Ninja Slayer from Trigger, the animation is lacking to say the least, but it's acceptable from Trigger, since it's their style. I wouldn't accept the same quality from Madhouse or KyoAni.

&gt;But once again, if those touches/ideas aren't inherently entertaining to the critic, why give leniency?

Because not every critic thinks like you or me. Their aim is to reach a majority of approvement among the critics. If this does not happen, then yes, it was a mistake from them, but if it happens, it'd hurt the industry to prevent them from continuing it.

&gt;It does to me. And since i'm only speaking for myself, then I have every right to say that it brings nothing to the table because it honestly doesn't to me, or to anyone who has a critical eye for anything.

And here we are again. Continuing from the previous point: Not everyone thinks the same, but you don't realize that. You think of yourself as an objective criticist, but you're really, really subjective. You think that only your opinion can be critically acclaimed, and that's inherently wrong.

&gt;You can fucking watch paint dry and gain some entertainment out of there somehow. Doesn't mean that it offers anything. It just means you found it entertaining, and just like anything, you might just not have any standards for anything.

I do have standards and preferences. Even if it does not look like it, I have them, just as every other person. I just have different levels of them for different subjects, as I have explained earlier and I think this is right for the abovementioned reasons.

&gt;But don't try pass that off as something people who do have a critical eye for entertainment or any standards whatsoever should try to understand.

Again, I did not do that, I just stated my opinion about the subject.

&gt;You can always pass something off as ""fun"" and that's where the conversation ends. Goodbye. It's fun. Great. Now if you want to talk or criticize something and when your own ideals get argued against and all you do is go fetal and repeat ""it's fun"" over and over again, a conversation doesn't happen and you come off as someone who's wildly insecure about their own tastes as well as completely disingenuous with your own criticisms of anything.

Of course I'm not going to defend Eromanga-sensei. Shit's not worth it. That's why you don't criticize wrestling for being fake, for example. Everyone who is connected to it knows it. Just as everyone knows that if you want to enjoy Eromanga-sensei, you have to lower your expectations. It's not worth more than ""fun things are fun"".

As I'm writing again, I just expressed my personal feelings about the show, and I didn't defend any of it's aspects in my original comments. I did defend the respective genres in my response to you. 

I am EXTREMELY insecure, good realization. Not about my tastes, though. I know what I like and I'm fine with it.

I did avoid having a proper conversation with you about it. I'm sorry, again. Hope this reply is good enough.

She was never your waifu. She was simply someone you were deluding yourself into *thinking* was your waifu. You were mistaken, ignorant, and lacking in reverence towards the sacred position of waifu, when you decided on her.

Though speaking of 'deciding' on waifus is nonsensical itself. One does not pick a waifu. A waifu simply *is*. Your waifu has been your waifu since the very beginning of time, and will continue to be so until the end of eternity, even if you have not always been aware of her.

There is no ""evolution"" when it comes to waifu. There is no stepping from one waifu to a ""better waifu"". Waifu is what awaits at the *end* of that ""evolution"". Waifu is the pinnacle, the perfect being. Once you reach perfection, there is nowhere to go. No *need* to go anywhere, as any change would be a change for the worse.

&gt; Fanservice done in classics like Gunbuster are a masterclass of animation and art

We still have fanservice being used in interesting  ways, you yourself mention the Monogatari series, which is a pretty good example (but  not the only one mind you). And please, let's not pretend that every show back then had artistically meaningful fanservice, Gunbuster is the exception not the rule. 


&gt; Fanservice has definitely gotten more contrived and the ecchi shows don't even have good plot to make up for it.

They never did. Making it sci-fi and having the characters be of an arbitrary age you find acceptable and can relate to doesn't make fanservice any more tastefull or any less stupid and contrived.
 
&gt; I feel like it is much more fair to compare classics to classics. Yes, there are lot of genre garbage but the way those shows are garbage has changed.

 Saying something doesn't make it true, and even if it is, in what way does garbage ""changing"" make it any better or worse? It's still garbage.

Back then we had shitty, poorly written shows set on spaceship, now we have shitty, poorly written shows set in highschool, what a downgrade.

Got an important question, how to manage my songs from the phone.

What I'm doing now is for every song put the name of the Anime as an artist and in album put ""anime""

But the problem is that when I have a full album of japanese songs which aren't from a specific anime, they won't be played together...

I thought maybe change everything to something more reasonable:

Artist's name in Artist (As in GARNiDELiA, ClariS and such) and in the album put the album name or if it's a single song or those I don't have the rest of the album- the name of the anime

Maybe.. But every album has its own pic

If goals and general ideology counts, I think a good (and for the future, inevitable) direction to go in is something like this:

Democracy similar to that of Germany (and thus what most democracies are like, at least not something as awful as America's political system) An unconditional basic income that allows living decently, above the poverty line. This compensates for increasing rationalization and the subsequent loss of jobs, it takes away the pressure from working environments, and people have the opportunity to follow their personal interests with much lower possibility for corruption, which allows for better science, art, and public discourse. This would be financed by, among other things, a strong tax progression on income. Not enough to make a high income not worthwhile(so there are still varying degrees if income because I do think that at least for the transition, and probably for a long time beyond that or possibly even forever, we need some capitalist aspects as motivation and because they're easier to implement(i.e. they're necessary)), but certainly more than in any current country on the world. The big challenge to those goals in the current world be that all companies (and subsequently most citizens) would just move to a country with less taxes to make more profit. This only really works with either a very well-educated society that believes in the fundamental good of humanity, or if every country changes to it at approximately the same time. In 1900, I think a system like this is probably impossible to do. In 2025, I think you can get fairly close. In 2200 something like this is probably universal - or I assume we live in a dystopia.

&gt; I watched the film Belladonna of Sadness today and it was interesting to compare to Rose of Versailles, especially as the RoV manga and Belladonna came out around the same time.   
  
Wooooo hyped to hear you saw it (and enjoyed it, according to MAL)!! Belladonna is probably one of the most extreme and strange films in the medium but as a part of the sort of greater feminist canon it's pretty indispensable, and really it's just fantastic on its own. An interesting detail I wasn't aware of until I checked out the interviews accompanying the restoration release, was that the film was originally intentioned to be pitched for young women and had many release tours with the idea of reaching that demographic, making it the first real Josei anime and showing some of the considerations that went on during that period in order to reach beyond the household market. I mentioned before how Ikeda developed the idea for RoV based on social revolutions going on at the time, so the two of them being released alongside one another and drawing from similar inspirations really does tell you how poignant these themes were for the time.  
  
A funny detail from Belladonna that makes the comparison even more interesting is who was involved with it: Osamu Dezaki himself worked on multiple animation cuts throughout the work as he was one of Tezuka's proteges at the time. The coincidence is really fun to consider, since he was working on this one feminist masterpiece while directing Ashita no Joe 1 at Mushi-Pro (Belladonna was in development for multiple years), and then working on *this* feminist masterpiece, RoV, while working on Ashita no Joe 2 about ten years later, both at studio TMS!!

A pet-peeve of mine for this series is I BELIEVE Shinsou deserves a spin-off.

I don't know how far the mangaka has already fleshed out the universe's future, so a concurrent spin-off narrative might be difficult, but Shinsou's struggle against stigma and his development would be such a good basis for a shounen-drama or seinen story.

* He would probably train under Eraserhead, go through a training montage like Deku cause physical fitness is a basic must-have for heroes, and customize his own Batman-esque utility belt and mask (a built-in adjustable voice-filter would help him trick people into responding)
* Exploring the advanced ethics of his quirk - like what crime scenarios he should avoid using his quirk even if it would be a quick resolution
* Get accused of some horrible crime and have to prove his innocence without relying on his quirk cause the victim(s) is traumatized or comatose and can't be questioned.
* Deal with low-key harassment as students outside of his class or those who outwardly support him potentially start being passive-aggressive or secretly disgusted
* Discover new limits to his quirk and have the surrounding stigma deepen to counterbalance the power-up.
* Meet a charismatic nemesis/rival whose made it their goal to ruin Shinsou's reputation... (Possibly someone else with a mind-control-type quirk)

I want to see him overcome all that inevitable adversity and keep hold of his own dream of being a hero (edit: or not, maybe face despair and then later renew his conviction! That could fit his story, whereas it wouldn't fit Deku's story)

Is it essay time?  I think it’s essay time.

Expect some of these to be just rambling.  I will probably address some mixture of my own feelings, my dissent against public opinion, and thematic analysis.  And I may repeat some sentiments I made a while back.

And I will only be addressing shows that finished this season.  So no Re:Creators rant yet.

These were a bit hard to write, and I got a bit burned out talking about shows I didn’t care about.  The final combined product is excessively long, and I don’t want to torture you all by reading all of it.  I’ll select a few that I think I have something substantial to say about and put them below.  [If you want to read about what I thought about the rest of the shows I completed, I’ll throw them all in a Google doc here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-LCaG-uHcg-G-iwWT3LHSuZ1qkiPAcDcbhSzQkZaK6g/edit?usp=sharing)

**Alice to Zouroku**

**Final Score: 7.4**

**MAL Score: 7/10**

My feelings about this show can be summed up as such:

**I like it when Sana is the subject, but I hate it when Sana is an object.**  To put things in simpler terms, the show is great when it focuses on Sana doing things, but its lower points come when things are happening to or around Sana.

The only character in this series who needs actual substantial growth as a human being is Sana.  Most of the cast are adults who either have their lives completely together (Zouroku) or are just deluded in their self-righteousness (Minnie C).  Those aren’t the people we should be focusing on.  Arguably along the same vein, neither should we be focusing on Sanae or the other kids who have Dreams of Alice.  They also are able to teach Sana many things about life and the outside world.

So making Sana the main heroine is the most logical conclusion because she needs the most development, making her a good candidate to experience the “Hero’s Journey” trope or whatever you want to call it.  But it baffles me so when they decided to make her the loli in distress during the first arc.  Sana is the “object” that is being fought over, and it completely undermines her development as a person.

You could argue that it’s Zouroku who is getting the development, but as I said earlier, he doesn’t need it.  He just blinks into existence in the car during Episode 4(?), and gives a speech to Minnie C about how he’s not taking any of her crap.  While his speech was indeed this highlight of that episode, he already entered with these convictions in mind, so we can’t really call that development.  At best, it shows how much Sana means to Zouroku.  

In fact, it is only such a highlight because it is more of a development of Sana than anything else.  It is a change in perspective on how Sana sees herself: as a human person who is loved rather than a tool.

The first half (with the exception of Episode 2, but especially Episode 5) was indeed the weaker of the two in the series because it treated Sana as an object rather than a subject.  The second half reverses this.  When Sana became the subject of the story, the series got a lot better.

Yes, the second half is a lot of slice of life elements.  Episode 5 was by far the most hype because of the fighting, but it was also by far the least meaningful.  The second half of this series, while a lot less action, is also the most impactful.

It works because it is about Sana learning about a lot of things and (I’ll really drive this point home again) developing as a person.  Episode 6 is where Sana learns about the concept of family and gets officially adopted by Zouroku.  Episode 7 is where she learns about what friends are, this concept that she had a vague idea of in her mind but could never quite put it to words.

Even the drama with Hatori and Ayumi all helped morally develop Sana.  Sana learned empathy and more about the gray area between right and wrong.  Sana got herself into most of her troubles, but she mostly got out by her own hand.  That is brilliant from a development standpoint.  And Hatori was the perfect foil for Sana to help process these feelings.

I think if this show knew what it wanted to be, this would easily be a top 5 of the season (minus sequels).  It has strong slice of life moments that actually didn’t feel meaningless like most in that genre.  But it also had these weird serious moments where A) we’ve seen them before done better, and B) contributed nothing to the development of Sana (or anyone for that matter).  Geez, Episode 5 wasted so much of my time that it just pisses me off.

**Eromanga-sensei**

**Final Score: 7.1**

**MAL Score: 7/10**

Here’s a weird thought, in terms of accomplishing its goals, Eromanga-sensei was actually the 3rd best anime of the season (of what I’ve seen) behind Tsuki ga Kirei and SukaSuka.

Think about it: what was Eromanga-sensei trying to sell?  An otaku-bait show featuring a loli harem with the intent of getting them into risqué positions.  Can we check off all of those boxes?  With a huge, giant check.

But on a serious note, this show was just a gigantic mess.  It’s impossible to take this show seriously.

Some characters were just absolutely inconsequential to the overall plot.  “Megumin” and bookstore girl should have been more present for essentially being the Ayase and the Manami of the show.  The third place guy did absolutely nothing but make quips and jabs for how many times he appeared.

We got two Kuronekos this time in Elf and Muramasa.  That’s fine.  I liked Kuroneko.  BUT, I don’t think two people should occupy her role as the “otaku companion”, even if her personality is split among the two of them to make the seem different.  Episode 11 was Muramasa confessing to Masamune in more or less the same manner as Elf did in Episode 10.  Could’ve just saved us the grief by having both of them be the same character and only devoting one episode to that confession.  Then develop more of the main plot elsewhere.

For a show called “Eromanga-sensei”, we actually didn’t get very much Eromanga-sensei.  I felt like a lot of the show was Masamune hanging out with Elf and Muramasa, and then the rest was Sagiri getting mad at him for doing so.  There were very few moments that made Sagiri stand out as a character, and some episodes she’s just missing entirely.  Fine, gimme the harem, but focus on the main girl at least, unless they’re playing the long con and Elf or Muramasa is the one he gets with (which I’m totally okay with).

I will say that the Sagiri moments were some of the few moments of the series that felt well done and developed.  Sagiri slowly coming out of her shell was a nice development that I wish could have been more of the focus of this show.  But no, we get an episode devoted to ochinchin instead.

I don’t know what to say about the ending except that was the lamest, passive, lazy ending that I’ve ever seen, which almost certainly guarantees this a season 2.

**Fukumenkei Noise**

**Final Score: 8.5**

**MAL Score: 8/10**

Let’s get one thing straight before I start here.  For the amount of praise I gave this show for its amazing use of symbolism and deep dialogue, I was never actually really invested in the romance itself.

Part of this may be because it was running in the same season as SukaSuka and Tsuki ga Kirei, two absolutely stellar romance series that will probably become comparisons for how I judge romance anime for a while.  It also ran alongside Renai Boukun and Eromanga-sensei, two anime that need to go die in a fire.  Fukumenkei Noise fell somewhere in the middle for me.

It may also have something to do with the fact that this show is a shoujo, therefore I am not its target audience by default.  But the irony of this statement is that Kimi ni Todoke is somewhere in my Top 5 anime of all time at the moment, so I dunno.  Fukumenkei Noise is probably only the second shoujo romance I’ve ever watched, so I’m pretty new to the entire genre.

So sure, maybe I wasn’t invested, but that doesn’t mean that I didn’t like it.  And I think this part was largely helped by the symbolism and the deep dialogue.  I cam empathize better with the characters when I know their thought processes, and this series did a pretty good job conveying each character’s wants and needs (even though they couldn’t do the same towards each other).  As a musician myself, I could definitely relate to the emotions they felt when playing and writing music.

I’ve talked at length before about the beauty that is the symbolism of the scenarios.  Each word spoken was said for a reason, and it reflected the innermost desires of each character.  Every scene served a purpose, and it framed a bigger story running in the background than what was happening in that moment.  I could write an in-depth analysis for each episode; the symbolism and dialogue should be noted and praised.  And maybe I will sometime in the future.

For now, it did a pretty good job.",anime

21697,"So your complaint about the pacing is something from season 1, that everyone already complained about...? 

You're entitled to your opinion, but I feel like you watched a handful of shows, then wrote a handful of paragraphs loosely related to AOT in order to make your ""controversial"" opinion seem more grounded and researched, when the truth is that you have very little substance in there. 

You have a flawed premise to begin with, AOT and plenty of other anime are not about the fights. Even Naruto or One Piece are not, at their heart, about the fights. They're about following the plot and the characters to their final destination. Seeing if Naruto becomes hokage, seeing if Luffy will become Pirate King. The fights are just things that happen in the meanwhlie, that are exciting for the viewers. In AOT the basic plot is *will they survive?* And all of the titan fights, and battles and so on are just stepping stones on that journey. Of course, you could say that of course they will. It's a freaking anime. No, not even that it's an anime, it's a freaking *story,* so of course 99/100 the good guys will prevail in the very end. But that's true of anything. JJBA can be seen as boring in that light too, since of course JoJo will win in the end. But it's an enjoyable watch anyway to see how it happens and why it happens. Same in AOT. While you were hating on the lack of fights there, the characters were actually being developed, the world was being further fleshed out, and the show was trying its best to convey to you the same sense of hopelessness and dread that the characters are typically feeling. Which is not standard fare in anime, and one of the things that I always enjoyed most about AOT. 

As for the internet spoilers you read.... First, that's your own fault for reading spoilers to a show you may be continuing. 2, I don't know what sort of spoilers you've seen, but things happen further in the storyline that simply can't be predicted at this point in the story yet, things that are both genuinely surprising and also change so uch of the ultimate direction of the show. If these are boring twists to you, then you're simply objectively wrong, because I don't see how they could have been more exciting or significant. ",anime

They do have a political correct way of speaking, it's just different from here. Things that may seem like insults in the Americas have no weight in Japan, likewise some things that are major grievances there are not worried about here.

A good example is situational etiquette. In many Asian countries, Japan included, there are proper and improper ways to do pretty much anything, usually around the theme of seniority. The one that I am most familiar with is drinking etiquette  (don't judge me) so I'll use that as my primary example. In the Americas, when you go out drinking with coworkers/student-peers everyone gets their own drinks, usually served for you, and if a cheers is called then everyone raises their glasses as equals regardless of age/experience. In asia it isn't the same. You can pour your own beer into a glass if you're given one but you do *not* pour your own hard alcohol. Someone else will do it for you. If they are your junior then they will serve you with two hands and you receive it with one. If they are your senior they pour with one and you revive with two. If you are of equal standing (age, rank, chain of comand, experience) then you both can use one hand. If a cheers is called then you raise your glass lower than anyone above you and higher than anyone below you (in rank, age, etc). To not follow these rules is a personal affront to whoever you are drinking with.

All this to say, different cultures feel differently about different things. Japan does have a PC culture, but like many other facets of their culture is not the same as their equivalents in the West.",anime
22110,"He isn't saying what you're interpreting as ""it's just pixels"". He's actually saying that it's nothing more than pixels and there is no more story or person behind them.

They are ""just"" pixels in that there's nothing more to them.

Sure, though, it does start to get muddy when it's based on a real person. It's not really the person, nothing happened to that person to get the picture in question, and it's still not a real physical thing that happened, however it could still possibly hurt that person if it's clearly based on them. **This is no longer ""just pixels"".** This is now ""pixels **PLUS an idea of a real person**"" or ""pixels **that form an idea of a real person**"" whatever you want to call it it's no longer pixels alone, it's something *more* than just pixels at that point.

That said, just having that adversity alone isn't enough to make me like something, so the ultimate reason is that... well, I just think the leads have good chemistry. Their more tender moments are surprisingly heartwarming, and it was clear to me from the outset that the two of them care about each other even at times when they don't like each other. It just works for me.

If you're American yourself, then I can see how listening to a dub would be more enjoyable - you're still losing the original nature/authenticity etc., but in exchange you're getting accents that you find a lot more relatable. 

But when I listen to dubs myself, it kind of just feels *wrong*; The accents simply stand out way too much. Japanese sounds fine because it fits in context, and an Australian accent would probably sound alright too since I just naturally wouldn't really notice it, but with a heavily-accented American dub my mind is just drawn to 'this is the accent of the dub voice actor', which makes me more aware of the whole process and kinda draws me out of the immersion a bit.

Only a couple of absolute disappointments in Hand Shakers and ClassicaLoid, plus one letdown from Chaos;Child. The top of the rankings was stacked with Rakugo 2, Kuzu no Honkai, and Demi-chan, with Maid Dragon and Onihei coming in at the next tier. ACCA was a pleasant surprise, and I seem to be one of the bare handful that didn't hate Seiren around these parts. Minami-kei was cute fun, though it kinda fizzled there at the end. Add in Youjo Senki and the start of LWA plus the second cours of 3-gatsu and Iron-blooded Orphans and to a lesser extent All Out!!, and I was one happy marine mammal for that 3-month span as I handed out five 9/10s. That's the most 9/10s that a single season has gotten from me since Summer 2015, and I was astonished at the sheer amount of quality titles that aired.

Spring, on the other hand, was much more of a letdown. Renai Boukun was a disaster to the point where I was comparing it to the garbage pile known as Kemeko Deluxe!, and Sin: Nanatsu no Tansai is just a hentai with a richer plot than usual. Kabuki-bu and Hinako Note were overall mediocre at best. Atom The Beginning was promising, but fell flat. Sakura Quest is struggling more than a small town. Sakurada Reset and Fukumenkai Noise had starts that were incredibly awkward, but turned around later in the season. LWA kept being LWA. BnHA2 and AoT2 weren't as hype for me as the rest of the crowd, with Titan feeling like it was more of a background season and Hero taking far too much time with the tournament arc for my taste. (Then again, I'm not fond of tournament arcs in the first place.) Kado, Saekano Flat, and SukaSuka were quality enough, but still not amazing. The only two 9s that came from this season belonged to Uchouten Kazoku 2 and Tsuki ga Kirei.

SukaSuka was similar in that aspect. The ending was already kind of spoiled from ep 1 and you are just trying to see if that's the conclusion it actually arrives.

The other conversation which I loved so much more this time around was the Rei and Haruka one. That was imo the highlight of the episode, because it showed so beautifully that a) Rei and Rin have a lot in common and b) Haruka isn't as free as he or his friends would pretend he is. 

I loved when Rin's past self shone through when Nitori called himself a lost cause. Rin's such a huge believer of working hard for what you love, which makes him a great leader.

[Euphemism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/euphemism)

Here's another word you might be interested in looking up ""Hypocrisy""

&gt;Really? Quoting me out of context?

It's called using your opponents words against his. And it's always a good tactic to throw someone off balance.

&gt;Who gets to decide this standard? You? You don't even like the genre, Why would we let someone who doesn't like the genre decide industry standards?

And neither are you by calling calling my based complains ""petty"". You're not calling the shots either by setting the bar or in your case lowering the bar and make all this BS believable to the point of falsely calling it ""realistic"". But so far in this thread, you're the only one calling this BS realistic when others aknowledge the BS and still like it.

&gt;1) Not assumptions, you're misusing that word repeatedly 

Grab a dictionary buddy. Assumptions: Noun. a thing that is accepted as true or as certain **to happen**, **without proof**.

Sounds a lot what you've been doing by telling us the MC might not even have a family or friends to mourn him over.

&gt;2) Your complaint was that someone who had died wasn't interested in anything else other than what was going on while he was drinking tea with literal fucking God, I gave you a perfectly possible explanation as to why he isn't concerned with those things. Assuming would be saying he is an otaku and they don't give a shit about anyone but that would actually be assuming. Regardless he straight up went to ask after requesting the phone if he would be able to use it properly to which God answered in the negative 

My complain was that his story or the lack of is totally unbeliveable.

If he lives alone, he must have a job to sustain himself. If he has a job, then at least his employeer will miss him when he died. 

How is it possible he feels no attachment to his past life, but suddenly feels the need to save two complete strangers when he couldn't give himself a second to think of those he left behind in the first place? It's totally absurd.

A ton of people had already stated that they find the Mc quite bland and therefore unbeliveable. On the other hand you're the only one in this thread calling all this BS realistic.

&gt;You know nothing either, That's the point of discussion and coming up with potential answers until more information is given 

And most of the time an actual beliveable explanations to all this horsehit won't come up anyway, so why wait? I got as much right to question all this BS than you have to ""assume"" oh my bad, give ""potential reason"". The difference is that you have no hardcore proof to stand on.


&gt;Giving a token ""It's trash and I'm trash for liking it"" is not very **honest**, It's avoiding judgment on perceived taste

I never said you had to call yourself trash for liking something. But admiting you like something that it's publically ignored or frown upon talks about honesty. Unlike to what you're doing.

&gt;Oh I don't disagree it has flaws, But I'm not going to sit there and let you dumpster on a show thats enjoyable with petty complaints

25782,"Sakura opinion is not unpopular at all, not even within the fanbase of the series. It's kind of a shame - She was horrendous at first but during the first few arcs of part 2 she was actually kind of cool, but eventually it became abundantly clear that as long as she kept being Sauce-cake's bitch she was getting absolutely nowhere. I don't think I've EVER seen a character with a feature as damaging to their own development as Sakura's obsession with him - If she got over him, she'd most likely have a much different, and probably far superior development. Basically all women in Naruto spin around on some guy, but hell at least Hinata (More or less the only female character with genuine development, besides maybe Tsunade and to a lesser extent Ino) used her love for Naruto positively, she could achieve her goals and overcome her self-esteem issues to the point of even slapping sense into Naruto (Which she would've never managed to do earlier in the series). Sakura's obsession with Sasuke is a complete road block for her since she can't even raise her voice against him, she's a scardy little kitten as soon as he shows up. But eh, the character development in part 2 is easily one of its worse features, so who knows if it would've been much better.

Watching them ripping each others appart over some [""pun""](http://i.imgur.com/3HJC62g.jpg) in the internet really cracked me up. In comparisson I'm liking Kadota a heck lot more than when he was introduced, his backstory along with Chitose baba caring for his health make both a more complete set of side characters.

I like [sassy Erika](http://i.imgur.com/dNdguF4.jpg) any day of the week, but I didn't find it that nice of her to be a total jerk towards the girls whom did nothing wrong to deserve her rude behaviour. I wonder if by the end of the series we'll get real acknowledgement of Takamiya being her father.

28596,"The first season was hilarious, and the second season had some high and low points, but overall it is definitely one of the funnier anime comedies. I tend to prefer that sort of style, where the comedy is from quick paced banter and visual gags rather than a single funny overreaction or skit a la Nichibros or even parts of Senyuu. 

I like for there to be a somewhat of an overarching plotline to give the entire story structure and meaning, and give me some way of relating to and caring for the characters. This was missing in Nichibros to its detriment, in my eyes, but is strongly present in Konosuba, Wagnaria, and even titles like Girl's Monthly Nozaki-kun. 

YuriYuri is a comedy I'm in the process of watching right now, which seems to be straddling the line between skits like Nichibros, and more organic interactions with an element of storytelling, but so far it has fallen on the latter side of the equation, and I really like that about it. 

Which I guess explains why I find Konosuba funny compared to other things, but not so much why I find Konosuba itself to be funny. To answer that, I'd say it is because each of the four protagonists already has a comedic element about them. Kazuma as the asshole straight man, Aqua as the super genki failure and drunkard, Megumin for amusing facial expressions, names, and her giant Achilles heel of actually being worthless in fights, and Darkness for being a masochist, but most importantly for finding masochistic pleasure in *everything* bad that happens to her. On their own these things would be worth a laugh or two, and then get old quickly, and I never enjoy scenes that focus too much on one of these elements. Like all the times that Darkness is getting beat up and loving it do nothing for me, because the gag gets old fast. But take all four of them together, and they have a lot of chemistry, their individual gags all mix together well. Particularly with the standard comedic duo of having a straight man and the funny man. Kazuma is the straight man, and the other three play off him very well. But at the same time that means when Kazuma is the one being ridiculous and waving panties around while the others judge him, it makes that all the funnier. Honestly, I thought Gigguk's video covered it pretty well, so I am sure there is some overlap between my response and his, but idk what else to tell you and this comment is already far too long.

29091,"The odd gender things are but they are not upfront for fighting human societal constructs. This section in the OP is particularly bad (I'm not afraid to call it bad) for reasons pertaining to shown character traits of these characters.

1st: Lucoa and Tohru are not friends. They act in a civil manner because Tohru - usually extremely confrontational and territorial - doesn't want to anger Ms. Kobayashi. Lucoa really doesn't give a fuck one way or the other. They aren't the same species (let alone the same faction), have disimilar sexual interests (one is a canon lesbian and the other is totally unknown or nothing at all) (really hoping Lucoa isn't into *little* boys), and nothing in their daily lives relates to the other (Tohru is literally a maid while Lucoa is guest of honour with her/the boy's family). Tohru has little reason to like her other than the fact that they came from the same world and hasn't sided with her in an argument in the series' run.

2nd: Lucoa *really* doesn't give a fuck. Not about Shota, not about the dragons (good to remember she isn't one), and especially not about humans. The world around her (from her perspective) pretty much exists to entertain her. Nothing more. She has no reason to care about standards placed on her by humans. 

This to add to the fact that the dub's rhetoric, while it does exist in some areas of the world, do not nessecarily  (and from a gaijin's perspective, *do not*) exist in Japan. There isn't the history of active, open discrimination that there is/was (or in the way there is/was) in the (post)colonial world. Japan never had a Stonewall or the riots that happened around it. They just adopted (marriage) laws similar to the West (read: USA) in order to look more like the rich (read: Western) countries, and that unfortunately included not giving LGB people the same marriage rights.

29417,"I very much disagree that it delivered on what it promised. The first episode shows a lot of promise; great aesthetic, setting, etc., and the pacing was pretty solid overall. After the first few episodes, the pacing went to hell, there were very few plot developments at all, just a couple boring fights and plot developments that were dumb as nails. It's not so much that it did things that were bad, just that it did very little that was good after the first few episodes.

TL;DR: It's so pretty, and started off promising, and then did nothing interesting with any of it. ",anime
29426,"They're not the easiest genre to get into. The biggest decider of whether a person sticks with fighting games is whether they have a friend group to play against.

It seems too relevant to today to not have been done as a commentary on that ideology. 
(side note: I think the centaurs are the rulers of the current society?

30267,"Actually, there's a reason behind this. The kana for tsu (つ) and su (す) both turn into zu when you apply dakuten (basically a thickening of the consonant) to them. So ず and づ are both read as zu. 

However, tsu is part of the t kana ""family"" which normally turns into d after you apply the dakuten (た - ta, だ - da) so the Japanese often call a づ a du even though it's pronounced zu to differentiate it from ず.

I hope this clears things up.",anime
30289,"The original Akiba's Trip games were premised around the idea that you strip the clothes off of vampires so they burn up in the sun. The concept was beautiful in its simplistic perverted perfection. It took a well-known mythos and presented an obvious-in-retrospect way to perv it up to the nth degree with minimal guilt. It was genius.

But then the anime changed everything. They were no longer vampires, but mostly regular people who were infected by weird bug things. They weren't defeated by exposure to sunlight, but by exposure to... air? For some reason? With few exceptions, the main characters were no longer stripping *the enemies*, they were stripping innocent people who were merely being controlled. The whole concept suddenly felt very contrived and full of non-sequiturs, like they were determined to NOT use the original concept but still find some excuse to strip people.

I'm guessing they did this and leaned so heavily on parody because they thought it would attract a broader audience (maybe they thought people wouldn't like all their ecchi burning up?). But dammit, I wanted to see 13 episodes of people stripping vampires to death.",anime

######Best:

1. [Fate/Stay Night](https://vndb.org/v11) Visual Novel.  
/r/fatestaynight has a guide for installing it iirc.  
Alternatively, you can read a text-based low-commentary lets play on [lparchive](http://lparchive.org/Fatestay-night/) (Just ignore any cursive text not starting with ""Music:"").

After this, you can watch any Stay Night anime if you want. This includes [DEEN's anime](https://myanimelist.net/anime/356/Fate_stay_night?q=stay%20n), [Ufotable's UBW anime](https://myanimelist.net/anime/27821/Fate_stay_night__Unlimited_Blade_Works_-_Prologue), and [Ufotable's upcoming HF movies](https://myanimelist.net/anime/25537/Fate_stay_night_Movie__Heavens_Feel?q=heaven%27s%20fee). As you have already experienced these in the VN, the order isn't really important, and if you don't like one, you can drop it without worry.

2\. [Fate/Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10087/Fate_Zero)


######Anime-only 1:

1. [Fate/Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10087/Fate_Zero)  
Prequel to Fate/Stay Night. If you don't like the first season, hold out until the second. The first season is rather slow in comparison to the second.

2. [Fate/Stay Night DEEN](https://myanimelist.net/anime/356/Fate_stay_night?q=stay%20n) ???  
You can leave this one out if you don't like it. It's the adaption of the Fate route, which set the fundamentals for what's to come in the other two routes. Though I don't remember whether that's true for the anime as well.  

3. [Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (Ufotable)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/27821/Fate_stay_night__Unlimited_Blade_Works_-_Prologue)  
If you don't like the first season, hold out until the second. Just like Fate/Zero, the first season is rather slow in comparison to the second.

4. [Fate/Stay Night: Heaven's Feel](https://myanimelist.net/anime/25537/Fate_stay_night_Movie__Heavens_Feel?q=heaven%27s%20fe) (not yet released)

-
######Anime-only 2:

2. [Fate/Stay Night DEEN](https://myanimelist.net/anime/356/Fate_stay_night?q=stay%20n) ???  

3. [Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (Ufotable)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/22297/Fate_stay_night__Unlimited_Blade_Works)  

4. [Fate/Stay Night: Heaven's Feel](https://myanimelist.net/anime/25537/Fate_stay_night_Movie__Heavens_Feel?q=heaven%27s%20fe) (not yet released)

1. [Fate/Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10087/Fate_Zero)  

---

People usually recommend the second anime-only order over the first, but I don't think it's really that important. I'd say, it depends on which kind of anime you prefer. Zero is more mature with professional characters who know what they are doing, but also constant switching between the characters, while Stay Night is the school anime with the morally white highschool protagonist who is a noob at magic and just stumbles into the battle royale.  

If you want to go with the order that's usually recommended (the second), make sure you're ready to wait with Zero until the HF movies have been fully released (or read that part of the VN).  
**DO NOT INSERT FATE/ZERO INBETWEEN TWO STAY NIGHT ROUTES.**

There are countless scenarios where wronged people are forced to do bad things to get the optimal outcome. 

Obviously SSY's more morally gray than that. [SSY](/s ""He targeted innocent people after all. But considering the facts of their society, he was left with no other rational choice beyond submitting to their system for his entire life and changing nothing. The Telekenetics were nigh-unstoppable unless Squealer came up with a plan to turn one of them against the rest. Perhaps the way he did it took it too far, but did it really? Was there any other possible way he could've done what he did without doing it the way he did? And he couldn't leave a single one alive because one was enough to kill every queer rat colony."")

[] (/s ""Honestly, I think SSY is so fascinating to me because it sort of justifies genocide. What happens when one group holds true complete and absolute power over others and use it to unequivocally enslave them and slaughter them by thousands on a while? That's clearly bad, yet that's exactly what the Telekenetics did. Is it alright, then, for the enslaved to rebel? Naturally, I don't think anyone in their right mind would disagree with that. But what is the cost of rebellion? Is there any too high? What if you must literally slaughter every single telekenetic to be free? Genocide of people based on ability though? Isn't that wrong? Hell, that's literally the entire overarching plot of X-men, and most people are on the X-men's side. Yet in the SSY universe, people are shown to work under the philosophy that with great power comes great corruption. As soon as telekenetics sprung into existence, the world ended. Only thousands of years later did a tenuous, arguable incredibly unethical balance come about due to scientific ingenuity regarding genetics and brain chemistry."")

[](/s ""But then from another approach, TKs are literally the next evolution of humanity and queer rats are literally a step back. Do the circumstances of how they got there matter in the grand scheme of things? As long as TKs can't kill one another, their society is essentially utopic. Would it be better if there were no queer rats to enslave at all and there were just the advanced humans? These are questions I don't think anyone has the answer to. Squealer certainly didn't. All Squealer was doing was acting on behalf of his people, which I don't think anyone can blame him for. In his eyes, all of his actions were justified because his people had mass injustice done to them for hundreds of years if not longer."")

And that was way longer and got way off tangent. But I think it all needed to be said. Philosophy is weird and completely arbitrary. To Squealer, the needs of his own people outweighed those of his enemies. No one could possibly blame him for that. If I were a queer rat, I'd certainly vote for him.

TL;DR: Squealer did nothing wrong.",anime

32706,"Hi ! I'm back again with more Monogatari watch order debate :P

Last year I made [this watch order chart](http://imgur.com/gallery/3uWkJlB). This was a pretty simple, to-the-point chart, very easy to follow for someone completely new to Monogatari. This was in January 2016, and Kizu wasn't available yet, so I didn't include it directly, but I put a note saying that the intended place is between Bake and Nise. I don't think anyone complained about it at the time :D

I'm planning to update this chart once Owari S2 is out (so I can put the exact layout of the arcs in term of number of episodes). I added some cool things, but the idea stays the same : something easy to follow without any additional work. I only needed to add Kizu at its intended place.

Then, the last Kizu movie was subbed, which means newcomers could finally watch it directly after Bake and not have to endure years of waiting like we did. However, I was still seeing some people suggest the true airing order, including Kizu after everything, which didn't make sense in my mind. So I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/6n9nn4/psa_about_monogatari_series_now_that_the_third/) to defend the ""Kizu second"" order.

Oh boy, mistakes were made.

First, I apologize to everyone who saw this post as something condescending or off-putting. I was so attached to what was, in my mind, the only order that made sense, that I just talked exactly as if any other order was stupid and only stupid people wouldn't understand that. That was not my intention at all, and I was completely in the wrong. Sorry about that.

A lot of comments discussed the viability of the airing order or other variations, but two comments, in particular, made me realize I was being closed-minded and opened my perspective. I edited my original post to include these comments, because they looked so right to me.

[This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/araragi/comments/6n8mdz/psa_now_that_the_third_kizu_movie_is_available/dk7ztwg/) by /u/Kotomine-kun's made me understand that you could just let the viewer decide : if he does want an extra element of mystery, and is open to rewatching the series after watching Kizu to make sense of earlier arcs that needed the added context, then he could decide to watch Kizu late in the series.

[This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/6n9nn4/psa_about_monogatari_series_now_that_the_third/dk7v0xc/) by /u/Sinrus, especially the third block, made me consider the ""Kizu between Owari and Koyomi"" order. Once I read his explanation, this particular order (which is still different from the airing order, but not much) made so much sense to me. The gist is, you get Shinobu Mail at the end of Owari, which is the last big Shinobu-related arc, and then you watch Kizu with the perspective of Shinobu Mail in mind, and it ""transports"" you to the beginning of the Monogatari timeline, which you traverse again from that point with Koyomimonogatari, building up until the last arc, with Owari S2 following immediately after. It feels so beautiful to me, I can't thank /u/Sinrus enough for his suggestion.

(Sorry for the lengthy rant)

Now, after all of this, my position is that you shouldn't try to recommend a watch order over another (which is exactly what I did, but I came to realize why I shouldn't have). It would be best to take the neutral way, by explaining the different possibilities and let the viewer decide which way is the one he thinks he would prefer. A lot of people liked the added mystery of not being able to see the events of Kizu until the end, but there are also a lot of people, me included, that disliked it for one reason or another. 

So, I've started to add a [new section](http://imgur.com/a/058PD) at the top of my chart, to do exactly that. That way, someone new to the series could decide which experience will be the best for him. Nothing in that picture is definitive, so if you have other suggestions (maybe different watch orders or variations), feel free to suggest it.

The only problem with this is, I'm afraid it will have the opposite effect of intimidating the viewer instead of helping him make sense of the series. With the first version of the chart, he just had to take a glance at it to understand which episode he should start with. If he has to read all of this before even starting the series, he might just react like ""wow, this looks so confusing, I don't have time for that, I'll watch it later"". It would be a pity to miss the Monogatari experience for such a reason, but I really can't decide between adding this section to let the viewer decide, or just pick an order (like Kizu between Bake and Nise) and just present it without any explanation or even indication that there are other possible orders.

And since I can't decide, I wanted to gauge your opinion with that poll. What would be the best option ? Including this section, which leaves the most freedom to the newcomer, but also adds the risk of confusing him ? Or keeping it simple, like the January 2016 version ?

To beat the heat I decided to stop by a comic store that I knew had at least a bit of manga. Maybe it's just because I haven't cared to look for them before, but an absolute ton of original shows, LN's and VN's get manga adaptations.

I knew stuff like EVA has gotten a manga release (multiple highschool spinoffs as well) but weird stuff like a shitty Steins;Gate manga, and some more oddities that I can't remember. For some of this stuff I really can't see the appeal of reading a manga adaptation.

Like Steins;Gate has a fantastic anime, and a stellar original Visual Novel that's not too long, why would you want to read a poorly adapted manga? I get that manga is more popular than anime and VN's in Japan, but who'd want to experience the story that way?

I get some stuff, like Umineko, Heaven's Feel or Tsukihime, where the manga exists to trim the fat of a very long VN, and the anime adaptations are dogshit or non existent.

They also didn't have any Hidamari manga. I might go track some of that down someday.

Also on a whim I started listening to TTGL music again. I still think [Happily Ever After](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tQ8d1bMf6U) is my favorite track. It backs some of the best scenes in the whole show, and unlike some of the more iconic tracks, the one I associate with the show the most.

First of all, the use of a black hole was masterfully done. Piercing through the enemy's weak point and turning their weakness into a strength is wonderfully done. Plus, using Mr. Lennen's thought that everything is a trap (after Iserlohn) let them escape without being destroyed. One thing that bothers me a bit is the whole ""helium explosion"" thing, as not only do things not explode in space (due to lack of oxygen), but helium is an inert gas. It isn't a huge thing to be bothered by, but it would have been a least a bit better if they used hydrogen. Either way, the traps were very well done, and Reinhard is not happy at all.

Also, we get another one of my favourite moments in the series: Yang wondering why everyone is on his ship. The one section with [Yang asking ""what is that?"" while pointing at Machungo is one of this series famous out of context shots](https://imgur.com/a/pVUEi).

Finally, we hear of Reinhard's plan to take down Yang: send out a bunch of thin layers well spread apart in order the drain Yang's endurance, while the rest of his forces come and surround him. It is well thought out, and considering Reinhard has to partake in the battle so that he can ""defeat Yang"", it is the best plan they could probably come up with.

The moment at the end with Reinhard was both sad and strangely happy at the same time. The fact that his path of battle was decided long ago (since his sister was taken) goes to show Reinhard has a set path in life that none can change. Much like Yang has been forced into battle due to finance and a one time ""miracle"", Reinhard has been forced to do battle for his sister, and then Kircheis. However, he is now about to engage the one person in the galaxy who can (and has) bested him in battle, and he can finally go all out with his skill. This is perhaps the first time since the death of Kircheis that Reinhard is happy, because he found someone he could connect with in the enemy.",anime

A slice of life comedy featuring a cast entirely or almost entirely made up of young girls drawn in a very 'cutesy' style.

Too much or too little drama, for one. For instance, a show like Love Live or Girls und Panzer I would disqualify for being too goal oriented. I would consider them sports or idol shows instead. On the other hand, a show like Flying Witch I wouldn't consider a cute girl show either due to there being too little going on. I feel like they need to be comfy, but also comedic.

Something like Kiniro Mosaic or GochiUsa. Non Non Biyori, Azumanga Daioh, and K-On are the *best* CGDCT shows, but they have more going for them than just cute girls. 

&gt; Do you consider the following shows to be a CGDCT Show?

The closest that I would actually consider a CGDCT show are Demi-chan and Teekyuu. From what I've seen, anyway. GJ-Bu would definitely be one if the MC weren't a guy, though. ",anime

I look at it this way, you can study a character in-motion or still. You can move through time and watch her attitude shift, or you can stay in one time and develop nuances and complexities in her current attitude. The former is better in a tale about growth, the latter is better in a more stationary tale (or for non-main characters). In a slice-of-life, for example, you simply want to know the characters more deeply. It's not like all the people who write slice-of-life have failed writing 101 or anything.

I guess perhaps because we didn’t get to see the remains of his body and they didn’t linger on the moment for very long.

I hadn’t expected his refusal to be so…graphic, but I don’t know what else I should have expected from him! What I didn’t predict in this episode, however, was the new ending! The boys are looking fresh, I really like the colour scheme going on, and I suspect the song is really going to grow on me. 


I am so pleased that Kuwabara won, and that he won in style. Whilst a flyswatter might not be the most glamorous thing, his one-liner beforehand definitely made it cool. I’m also pretty pleased that he did confront Yusuke about the whole Genkai thing – I think it was a conversation they definitely needed to have. Kuwabara deserved an explanation, and Yusuke did need to voice his feelings. I also thought that Yusuke’s recognition of his coping mechanisms really does show a growing maturity.


Sakyo’s bet did seem a bit ridiculous at first, but his discussion of his past with Toguro went some way to contextualising his mindset. In a way, most of what he described seemed pretty realistic for a consummate gambler…uh, except that whole part about killing animals in the backroom of a pet shop.

Greetings Comrades and fellow Denizens of the Wired, I hope that you have been enjoying all of the fluff and fun times, because it's time to get ready for the TOURNAMENT ARC! [Love Live!](/s ""AND DRAMA AND SADNESS!"") We're about to get serious now Comrades, so without further ado, let's get to it! Warning, Love Live! and Gundam Build Fighters Try spoilers below, enjoy!

Before we begin this episode, we must address our recap, brought to us by the glorious Nico! She even graces us with the powerful Nico Nico Nii as she delivers a wonderful introduction. Oh, wait, she was supposed to recap the beach episode wasn't she? Hold on a second, some foul heretic slandered Nico by claiming she was ""lame,"" Nico even said so in the episode, this must be the work of an enemy stand! But before going into that, let's move on to the episode.

We see Honoka departing for school, introducing herself as if it were the first episode of a series. Also, it appears that Japan's phenomenon of declining birth rates is canon for the series' universe, which makes thing interesting given [Gundam Build Fighters Try](/s ""the links that Love Live! has with Gundam Build Fighters Try, given that Otonokizaka Academy is one of the participants in the series."")

Also, we see that μ's has had some great success recently, as they somehow jumped from rank 50 to rank 19, more than enough to qualify for the TOURNAMENT ARC! I must say that even having seen this before, I am still surprised as to the massive jump. I mean, the beach episode was great and all, but was that all it took to jump the ranks that much? Guess the fans like the fanservice.

Anyways, Honoka informs the bird and Umi of the good news, before screaming out a title drop for the heavens. Honoka's classmates are also pleased to hear of the good news, and are shocked at Honoka's informal greeting with Eli. Honoka then explains the plot of the last episode to the trio.

As the trio wisely try to get autographs before the final push for stardom, we see one of the candidates for world's smallest signature, courtesy of Umi. Honoka, noticing this, writes one of the largest signatures I've seen so far, so big in fact that she partially ran out of room.

Additionally, it appears that the glorious Nico is off duty at the moment, which I still am surprised over. If she gushed so much over her merch, you'd think she'd be overjoyed at giving out autographs, but I digress.

Honoka then notices that the bird is missing, and we cut away to the bird, who is pensively staring at the ominous letter we saw a few episodes ago. We then move on to Serval and Honoka gushing over the stage they are to perform on. Nico criticizes her backup dancers' swooning, until she too is overcome by emotions and squee.

Eli and Nozomi arrive to inform the baka trio that they can't rest yet, as there are still two weeks to go, and every school idol group is giving it their all for the final push. As Nico declares her readiness to do whatever is needed, Eli decided to assign Nico... the grand task of participating in a lottery.

Undeterred, Nico takes this in stride and dramatically turns the handle. As everyone goes into slo-mo and waits in anticipation, sans Nozomi who does her typical mystical stuff, we get the dramatic result of... complete and utter failure.

Clearly we had interference, someone rigged the lottery, it must be the heretic from earlier, OR AN ENEMY STAND! But, moving on to the failure of μ's to secure the use of the auditorium. Meanwhile, it appears that the morale of Nico's backup dancers has completely broken, with even Nozomi in shock, oh the humanity! She isn't even Washi-Washing people, NANI!

The members of μ's panic on the rooftop, sans the unflappable Maki, with even Nozomi broken from the experience. Eli then tries to smooth things over by suggesting that μ's practice somewhere else. Nico suggesting using the club room, after all, they got that expansion recently, but Honoka claims that it still is too cramped.

Then, Honoka comes up with a (bad) idea to practice in the more cramped area of the hallway. Nico rightly notes that they'd all look like idiots if they did that. After a bit of arguing Honoka comes up with the idea of practicing on the roof.

Honoka then proposes that, in order to attract people to the roof, that they merely sing very loud. As Honoka and the bird walk home, the bird seems preoccupied with something. After a bit of mumbling, the bird states that they should all give it all they've got.

We then see the bird and her mom discussing something seriously important, to which the bird is to make the final decision on. Honoka's suggestion for the performance is a new song of Maki's, to which all the members swear to work hard on to ensure that they are ready for the performance. As Honoka is to be the center, she is told by Eli to work twice as hard to ensure peak performance.

Honoka interprets this to mean night training, to which her sister warns of her to be careful, right as admission information to Otonokizaka can be seen under her homework. We then see a lovely poster for the upcoming concert, with Nico rightly in the front, and Serval rightly with a cat-like expression on her face.

As the bird attempts to speak with Honoka again, Honoka runs off to tell everyone in the class about the concert. Honoka appears to be working overtime, as she came up with new dance moves, which raises feelings of apprehension amongst the group, except for the acquiescence of the bird.

Umi tells Honoka that she should take it easy, Honoka responds by ignoring this advice. Umi attempts to get the bird to help, but the bird sides with Honoka. Later, we see Honoka sneezing as she's on the phone, it's probably nothing right? [Love Live!](/s ""IT'S NOT!"")

Honoka thinks that the bird is not acting any differently, before sneezing again. As Umi tells Honoka to NOT get sick and take the night off, Honoka decides to ignore the sane member of her year and go off training again... IN THE RAIN!

Please excuse me for a second while I smash my head into my workdesk.

Ow, well, now that that's out of the way, Umi gets a call from the bird, as the bird has some important plot stuff to say. Hm... I wonder what this could be...

After Honoka's night of training, her mom wakes her up, scolding Honoka for not waking up earlier for the cultural festival. Honoka's response is to sneeze again, with blurred vision to boot, before collapsing. With a look of shock, she feels her throat, before we cut to Serval and Hanayo noting the pouring rain at the roof.

Meanwhile, while Nico is getting excited, Umi and the bird are discussing something serious. Honoka shows up late and unprepared, before stumbling into the bird. Eli claims Honoka's voice sounds strange, to which Honoka claims she can just take a cough drop.

The trio of colleagues are busy advertising the concert, the members of μ's note that the rain isn't letting up. Honoka states that they should perform anyway, as they of μ's do not give up. Amidst the rain, the members of μ's prepare to start, with Eli and Honoka's sisters in the audience as well.

We then move on to a rocking performance from the great members of μ's, surely nothing can go wrong right?

WRONG! After the great performance, Honoka keels over from the deadly Japanese Cold! EGADS! I know Sunrise made this show and all, but who let crazy ol' Kill 'em All Tomino in to guest write? Oh wait, she JUST has a fever, and you know, has collapsed from utter exhaustion.

THIS IS STILL NOT GOOD, NOT ACCORDING TO KEIKAKU!

[](#notaccordingtokeikaku)

As Honoka is sprawled out in the rain, all she can mumble is for the next song, to which the bird wails in sadness.

[](#everythingisfine)

Well, that was certainly a way to end an episode. I've seen it all before and I'm still at a loss for words. See you all on the next thread, and until then, farewell, now, if you'll excuse me.

* Aesthetics, obviously. Everything from character designs, backgrounds, and movements are very different from western cartoons. I don't think western cartoons are ""worse"" in this sense, but I don't find them nearly as appealing to me aesthetically as anime.

* Genres/Styles - There are just straight up genres that are missing or so completely different in the US that they might as well not exist. 

For example, shounen action. What is the closest thing that the US has that even comes close to this. Maybe...PG-13 movies? Action cartoons? But cartoons are overwhelmingly skewed towards comedy and the closest thing we've had, Avatar, seemed to be the exception moreso than the rule. In terms of movies, the animated varieties tend to be comedy moreso than action and the action movies all tend to be live-action.

And that is not mentioning things such as Slice of Life/Iyashii, Sports, mecha etcetc.

* Japanese voice acting - Japan has a giant pool of talented and diverse voice actors whom I love hearing. I am not bashing dubbers or American voice actors -- They are also very talented. However, Japanese voice actors bring something different to the table which can't be replaced by american ones

In that case, first of all my opinion on that: I think you're wrong. People are still complaining about things. The problems with Netflix and especially Amazon didn't go away just because some shows are poorly received. I think what is making you believe that people are fine with it now is that you don't see the complaints on reddit as much anymore. That is probably because you will see most of them during the time when the services announce which shows they licensed and not as much in the episode discussion threads. As I said, the problems are still there and you will see the discussions again when we start getting news for the next season. 

And second, one thing I want to mention: I think your title and even the post itself are very misleading if this is the point you're making. A title like that and the post mostly being critiques (if you can call Digibro's and Best Guy Ever's mindless nitpicky bashing a critique) makes it seem like you just want to bash the shows yourself, basically saying ""look at you and your hype, you were wrong"". Next time you want to make a point or start a discussion about the problems with certain streaming services you might want to make the post mostly about that.

38188,"I'll break it down I guess. Madoka I thought was good, but not as good as r/anime has raved about it. The story wasn't as amazing that I thought it was gonna be, but I still liked it. The animation though was gorgeous to look at.

Black Rock Shooter - now I read some past posts on this and the general take on it was that people thought it was too confusing. I loved it, I thought the story was awesome and overall I enjoyed it more than Madoka. 

Special A was a great watch. A rom-com that I enjoyed. 

RahXephon OVA - a nice, quick philosophical watch but nothing compared to the main series. 

H.O.T.D. was fanservice galore with good action. Though if I ever get caught in a zombie apocalypse there ain't no fucking way am I gonna group with a bunch of whiners. 

Battle Angel Alita was a damn good 60 minutes of a story that needs more attention and a full length series. 

Bakemonogatari was, so far the best watch. This was simply the grandest anime I've watched out of all of 'em. I'm a complete sucker for the subtle romances in anime and this one did a perfect job at it. The animation, the story arcs, EVERYTHING about it was art!

I'm a complete sucker for the ones that have a subtle romance and tragedy among the characters and in the plot as well. So to answer your question, out of everything I watched, Black Rock Shooter and Bakemonogatari were the only ones that I didn't feel were 'meh.'  ",anime
38198,Next you are going to tell me that the Student Body has an ounce of influence on anything,anime
38207,"If you liked *Inuyasha*, you should watch *Maison Ikkoku*. It is based on a manga by the same author, yet totally different with no fantasy element what-so-ever. When it isn't being hilarious, it may be a bit dark, but it is never grim.

If you liked *Full Metal Alchemist*, give *Full Metal Panic* a try. It is nothing like *Full Metal Alchemist*, it is a mecha action romantic comedy that for mysterious reasons has a similar name. And it is a great series. There are large metal people shaped thingies in it however, so you won't be entirely lost.

If you liked *Deathnote*, then you might like *Potemayo* as it has a cute little death ray shooting demon/shinigami character in the supporting cast. I don't think anyone dies, but several characters become very embarrassed in the course of the series. However, I feel I must warn you, there is some pee pee. Alternately you might try *Hare + Guu*, which has an all powerful liminal being that makes a poor normal boy's life a living hell.

My point is, anime has an incredible level of diversity. It would be a shame to only look for things similar to what you have seen before.

Edit: *Epilogue*.  When I first got seriously into anime, I finished *Cowboy Bebop*. I was **sold**! ""Where can I get me some more stuff like this?"" I asked myself and others.  Alas and alack, there was no such creature, it was unique. But there was a happy ending anyway ...

Edit 2: There is a series based on a manga by the same authors that created Deathnote. It is about a couple of young boys who set out to become the authors of a manga that inspires a hit anime series. Think of it as a fictionalized ""Making of Deathnote"" documentary.  Meta, no?

Fact is LGBT relationships run the full gamut of relationships from totally monogamous to polyamorous, pure vanilla to 24/7 ownership and everything in-between.  Same same-sex relationships will look like a stereotypical straight relationship, but many don't, just as many straight relationships don't look like the stereotypical straight relationship.  Same-sex couples face the same problems straight couples do, just the configuration of genitals is different.

If Suzy wants to be a home-maker, more power to her.  If Jessica wants to be the next president, you go girl.  The same applies to same-sex relationships.

starting shokugeki no souma s1, because a friend recommended it to me and i want to join in on the s3 hype next season, pretty funny and i love over the top stuff and i don't mind the ecchi. i'm only 2 eps in so far but it looks like i'm going to enjoy this one quite a bit

i watched redline. i had seen this movie before like 6 years ago, but i didn't remember much of it. i see people saying that you shouldn't take redline too serious and that the characters are supposed to be silly stereotypes and stuff but i just couldn't get into the characters honestly. the animation was super fluid and extremely nice (shoutouts madhouse) but during the 40 minute or so race part most of the time i was just asking myself ""what the fuck is happening i can't see anything"". the voice acting was really well done though and it didn't feel like a waste of time, so i'm feeling a **6/10**",anime

How is it going ? I'm finally done with uni related stuff, all that's left is some papers regarding my flat, but I just gotta hand them out on September 1st, so I'm relatively free starting now. 

I should receive Persona 5 in a matter of days and I'm **very** excited to play it, it's also the first time I play a game from the franchise (P3 FES PAL cost like a hundo at least, which is fucked up). Only thing is that I don't know which language I'll be playing. I hate french localisation with passion, so I'd be happy with an english copy, but the site I bought it on was a mess so I don't have any info on that. I miss the times when PAL versions had several dubs and you could just pick the one you want.

Now I'm gonna finish Shokugeki no Souma, probably start S2, and hang around a bunch

I’ve been gone the past few days of the rewatch due to AX, but I’ve caught up again. So, briefly, here are my thoughts on the episodes I missed before I talk about today’s episode.
 
**Episodes 35-38**
 
We finally figured out what Rubinsky and the rest of Phezzan have been planning with the former members of the Lippstadt Alliance. They’ve been planning a kidnapping plot of the Kaiser Erwin.
 
What I love about the plan is that the kidnapping is only the first part of the plan. It’s a real wheels-within-wheels kind of plan. Phezzan initiates the kidnapping and gets Erwin to the Alliance. There, they make a government in exile. This will divide political opinion in the Alliance while uniting the people of the Empire for a war against the hated nobility in support of Reinhard. Reinhard gets to launch a war with massive public support to unify the galaxy. It’s brilliant.
 
I didn’t expect Reinhard to get told about the plan by Phezzan. And Reinhard actually goes along with the plan. Reinhard’s always been brilliant, and this shows how good he is at manipulating people. It’s still not clear if Phezzan manipulated Reinhard, or if Reinhard is using Phezzan. Reinhard does threaten Phezzan and demand free access through their borders. This will be an interesting development to follow.
 
The development also once again shows off how ruthless Reinhard can be in sacrificing some subordinates. He may not like it, but he’s always willing to let Oberstein talk him into it. It really does seem like Kircheis and Annerose are the only ones Reinhard did not ever consider as pawns.
 
It’ll be interesting to see how the war develops with Erwin’s exiled government in the Alliance. Reinhard has declared all out war on the Alliance. I’m certain the war will only grow. I expect Phezzan to be involved even more. This is an interesting turn of events.
 
I also want to point out that Erwin is quite a brat. I’d expect no less from a child king.
 
Also, I am kind of surprised that Oberstein really does have a dalmation. For some reason, I thought that rumor would be false. I can’t picture Oberstein being nice enough to care for a dog.
 
**Episode 39**
 
On today’s episode of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Julian has left Iserlohn and is now on his way to Phezzan. I feel like Julian will be at the center of future events because of his new position in Phezzan. 
 
We’re losing people at Iserlohn. Julian is being sent to Phezzan and Merkatz has been appointed to the exiled Imperial government. Some of the best people are leaving.
 
Julian is being sent to Phezzan, which is certainly going to be an important place in the future. Yang tells Julian as much. Yang is always so clever, able to see past the schemes of the people around him. He’s guessed that Reinhard may have allowed Erwin to be kidnapped because Reinhard benefits most from it. And he’s guessed that Phezzan may be helping the Empire to conquer the galaxy and is trying to benefit from that.
 
Julian shows he’s no slouch either. He guesses that Phezzan may have a non-material reason for their actions, like religion or ideology. Considering Phezzan and the Earth Cult are practically the same thing, this is a pretty good observation.
 
I always love Yang’s ruminations on history, as he observes that the situation is going to change. He says people have a tendency to assume the status quo will remain, but warns that something unthinkable like Phezzan teaming up with the Empire can happen. He also once again says there’s no reason the Empire and Alliance will last forever.
 
Julian’s goodbyes were nice to see. I like all the different ways the people said goodbye, as well as the various gifts they gave to him. I have a feeling that knife he got from Schenkopp will be important.
 
I also find it hilarious that everyone is worrying about whether Yang can take care of himself without having Julian around.
 
It’ll be interesting to see Julian acting on his own. He’s already shown that he has a sharp mind, having been raised and trained by Yang. And he’s also been trained in hand-to-hand combat by Schenkopp, as well as learning how to dogfight. I think Julian may become the most OP character in this show if he continues to train in all these. That would be cool to see.
 
Side notes: This is the episode that features [Yang’s scene talking about alcohol being humanity’s friend.](https://youtu.be/E_YxauHnpyg) This is one of the first things I ever saw about Legend of the Galactic Heroes. It’s still hilarious in the show itself.

Sometimes, you make a word choice that would be totally valid in some cases, but not this time (notably, in episode 1 of Setokai no Ichizon, there's a point where you translate ""yuutsu"" as ""depression"", which is totally acceptable, except that they're quite clearly referencing Haruhi, and as such, ""melancholy"" would have been a better choice, as that's how the translators there decided to render the word).

44655,"""Back when I was in the sixth grade, my whole family went out to go watch a baseball game at the stadium. I didn't really care about baseball, but I was surprised by what I saw when we got there. Everywhere I looked, I saw people. On the other side of the stadium, the people looked so small, like little moving grains of rice. It was so crowded. I thought that everyone in Japan had to be packed in there. So I turned to my dad and asked him, ""Do you know how many people are here right now""? He said since the stadium was full, probably fifty thousand. After the game, the street was filled with people and I was really shocked to see that, too. To me, it seemed like there was a ton of people there. But then, I realized it could only be a tiny fraction of all the people in Japan. When I got home, I pulled out my calculator. In social studies, I'd learned that the population of Japan was a hundred some odd million. So I divided that by fifty thousand. The answer was one two-thousandth. That shocked me even more. I was only one little person in that big crowded stadium filled with people, and believe me, there were so many people there, but it was just a handful of the entire population. Up till then, I always thought that I was, I don't know, kind of a special person. It was fun to be with my family. I had fun with my classmates. And the school that I was going to, it had just about the most interesting people anywhere. But that night, I realized it wasn't true. All the stuff we did during class that I thought was so fun and cool, was probably happening just like that in classes in other schools all over Japan. There was nothing special about my school at all. When I realized that, it suddenly felt like the whole world around me started to fade into a dull gray void. Brushing my teeth and going to sleep at night, waking up and eating breakfast in the morning, that stuff happened all over the place. They were everyday things that everybody was doing. When I thought about it like that, everything became boring. If there's really that many people in the world, then there had to be someone who wasn't ordinary. There had to be someone who was living an interesting life. There just had to be. But why wasn't I that person? So, that's how I felt till I finished elementary school. And then I had another realization. I realized fun things wouldn't come my way just by waiting for them. I thought when I got into junior high, it was time for me to make a change. I'd let the world know I wasn't a girl who was happy sitting around waiting. And I've done my best to become that person. But in the end, nothing happened. More time went by and before I knew it, I was in high school. I thought that something would change."" - Haruhi Suzumiya",anime

It's just three simple slashes but your imagination fills in the rest with the descriptions given. And the [anime version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFDnDmLyII) just makes your imagination come to life. Saber's intuition is shown, the impossible speed of three strikes at once is shown.

There's practically no situation where I think harem romance is better written or developed compared to normal romance, in fact I'd even go as far as to say that (nearly) every harem romance would be better as a one on one romance with proper development compared to the split development in a harem. The romantic conflict brought by a harem is rarely something that can't be replicated with a love triangle or minor love rival, and the comedy that a harem brings is often pretty specific ""harem"" comedy, that is only funny if you specifically like harem comedy. Stuff like falling on boobs or panty shots isn't good general humor. And even the harems that are praised are often significantly different than a standard harem. When a genre's best examples are subversions, something is probably wrong with the genre. I think harems are honestly close to being just objectively bad. ",anime

Ahh, it seems the change in location did well for Oscar, giving us and her an opportunity to really see the situation that’s brewing under the surface. Things are quickly starting to heat up for France.

We’d already been introduced to Robespierre earlier, but here we really got to see him in action. He seems pretty cool so far. His heart is in the right place aka saving France. And he wasn’t exactly wrong either. Everything he said was the truth. The poor and still really poor in France. And we’ve seen the Queen in the Palace spend money without a care while ignoring her durities. It’s hard to defend Marie Antoinette here…

The other new character we met was Madame Polignac. It was another sign of Antoinette’s trusting heart in that she immediately pulled her into the Palace. Antoinette is the type of person who does anything she can for those she considers her friend, and is utter bored with anyone who doesn’t interest her. It’ll be interesting to see if this bites her in the butt later. We didn’t get to see much of Madame Polignac today. Just a simple introduction. It’s nice to see an act of Antoinette’s kindness in an episode condemning her, even if it’s also an act of favoritism.

So Oscar is now more aware than ever of the problems plaguing France and the growing tensions against the King and Queen. She was suspicious that it would come to this, but it’s been growing more rapidly tahn she imagined. The question now becomes; What can Oscar do? Will Oscar confront Marie Antoinette about her spending problems? Will Marie Antoinette be able to listen?

That said, the japanese government spends a lot of money on dubious programs intended to encourage people to hook up. A lot of them are culturally-based (like workshops on how to behave on dates). Giving money to TV anime (particularly shows that are aimed at teenagers) in exchange for positive portrayals of romantic relationships makes a lot more sense than things they are actually doing, and similar campaigns have had huge success in the US (I'm thinking specifically of a campaign in the 90s to demonize drunk driving &amp; several campaigns running from the mid-80s to the present day to encourage enlistment in the military).

To do that, they wouldn't target the extreme harem trash (Eromanga-sensei is safe because the otaku wizards are too much of a small audience), but instead would go for stuff aimed at 15-18 year olds (so, the iisekai LN magical academy junk).

Part of the problem is that, with most of these shows, the characters all start at the same point, in the same way and it becomes entirely predictable how the character development will go. Personally, that's why **I** can't really stomach watching or reading all these Isekai stories or magic highschool ones. When all the characters start the same, it tends to go off in the same direction.

Realistically, it's not really the same thread of development, but when most stories star a teenage boy with limited magical capability who's secretly a badass, without any realistic parental figure, and an enemy that must be, eventually conquered and limited sense of self-worth, it sorta kinda goes off in the same direction every time, or, at least, feels like it.

Mondays I go to the gym after school, Tuesday through Thursday I have morning swimming squad, on Friday I do badminton or some other after school activity, and on Saturday, I do fencing.

I'll get home from school at 4 or 5, depending if I had an activity after school, and maybe after a 30-15 minute break where I'll go get a coffee, I sit down and do two hours of study and homework, with a set schedule for what subjects I should be revising each day if I don't have homework.

I'm not to hot on the idea of beginner anime in general, you don't have beginner Hollywood films or beginner UK TV so why would anime be different? The only exception is obviously parodies and shows that rely on references. What I can do is talk about shows for skeptical first timers, in that case I'd say go shows that aren't full of otaku bait shit and aren't super teenager-ish. Stuff like:

- Macross plus
- Yamato 2199
- Kenshin T&amp;B
- Gits:SAC
- Shouwa Rakugo
- Cowboy Bebop
- Gundam 0080
- Wolf's Rain
- Golden Boy
- Planetes
- Captain Tylor
- Black Lagoon
- You're Under Arrest
- Hi no Tori (the various versions)
- Legend of the Galactic Heroes
- Gundam 08th MS Team
- Detroit Metal City
- Usagi Drop
- Gundam Build Fighters
- Kuroko no Basket
- Hajime no Ippo
- Riding Bean
- Gunsmith Cats
- R.O.D OVAs
- Cobra
- Cyber City Oedo

None of that stuff has the cringey teenager stuff in it, which is the most impotant thing to avoid, and neither is it stuff full of injokes and references. It also avoids the dreaded moe (not saying moe is bad, just saying maybe not best for a skeptical watcher) and otaku bait stuff, like maids and not-cest. Some of those shows are fluff and some are heavy but none of them should be turn off to the medium for smeone skeptical about it.",anime

53282,"What I read about those comments is people happy that Holo beat a strong Opponent in Megumin (a character that a lot though would win this contest)

This contest is always decided by the lurkers Holo fanbase and others like Misaka last year just want to see their favourite girl to win for once, and what happen last year is just boosting those comments. 

If we wanted a fair contest, people should be allowed to vote if they saw both shows, but that would make the contest less fun because most people wouldn´t never vote. I thought Holo would lose not because of spite votes or because she is less popular but mostly because S&amp;W is a show that while popular is too old (yeah... 2007/09 is too old I guess) and a lot of new viewers didn´t see the show yet and neither is their cup of tea compared to a comedy fantasy setting. I will be suprise if Holo wins vs Ryuuko I see a lot of megumin voters say they will spite vote Holo. Ryuuko is a strong character and deserve to win the contest too but will be sad the only reason she wins is because of spite but will see ",anime

My favorite genres are mysteries, psychological thrillers, and [Dwindling Parties](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DwindlingParty)(I.E.

Anyways, like the music of what your generation is, it spoke to you. As much as the animation was cool, the dystopian world that Akira was created, you were expecting it.

55128,"Rant incoming:


The characters are pretty much all ripped off from other popular LNs. It's kind of hard to describe them, though. Everyone is cliched to the point where it hurts to watch, including the MC and, unlike 8man (whose character archetype and even he himself ironically become cliches), he doesn't notice those cliches.

I'll never understand that type of character in anime. How can one not have any hobbies or interests whatsoever? Unless it's in a damn Kafka novel, that type of character just doesn't work. Especially in this type of medium, where one's living conditions and surroundings and, probably most important of all, history and past experiences, are barely explained and everything is focused on relationships between a small cast of characters.

If you want that kind of character in your story, you have to make like classic Russian novelists and describe how a wheat field looks, who maintains it, how it came to be and how it fares in bad weather across 250 pages in a 1500 page book. Only if you put extraordinary detail in the setting can you make a character like that work. Those writers even upped the ante by describing their characters in even more detail. I understand it's easier to start from a completely blank slate character who only has a name and then add cheap character development later on, but that never turns out well. A character like that simply isn't a well written character. A certain character can be flawed but still well written. This type of character cannot ever be considered ""well-written.""

The entire medium of light novels is so damn cheap it's infuriating. Do the writers of light novels not have a shred of dignity as artists whatsoever? How can they express themselves in such a boring, unsatisfying way in a setting that's been done a million times with a few small changes, and with characters that pander to the worst audience on this planet? Perhaps that is the reason why 95% of all LNs ever written, in my opinion, are garbage. Just a quick money grab with no substance or heart put into it whatsoever. A plagiat of a plagiat of a plagiat which plagiarized something that was inspired by a western plagiat. That's what light novels are.

Heaven's Feel is three films which basically tell an alternate version of the events of UBW- they start in the same place, but the characters make different decisions early on which send the narrative in a very different direction.

Boku no Hero: I have on hold after seeing the first episode. I hope to revisit it some day but I'm not really a fan of super heroes.

Chuunibyou: I love this show more than most. I don't know what to say.

Durarara: On hold after 1 episode. It was okay.

Hyouka: Dropped after 9 episodes. I really wanted to like it but I just couldn't get invested. I'm not really a fan of mysteries so I was bored for the most part.

Kiznaiver: I thought it was fun and an interesting concept even if the ending was weird.

Mirai Nikki: One of the first anime I'd seen and probably the show that made me an anime fan. I probably wouldn't like it as much on a second viewing but it holds a special place in my heart.

Shinsekai Yori: Dropped after 5 or 6 episodes. I just found it really boring  and stupid. It doesn't do a good enough job of explaining the world so its hard to really get attached to the characters. I actually like the art style though it was fairly inconsistent.

Rakugo Shinju: Dropped after 1 episode. It's just not for me.

Steins;Gate: On hold after 1 episode. It was okay and I fully expect it to get better but I'm setting it aside for now.

SAO: There's not a single redeeming quality about it if you ask me. I didn't expect to hate it as much as I did. I gave up after the first arc because the next one was supposed to be even worse.

Tanaka-kun: Dropped after one episode. I just found it too slow. I get that that's the point but by the end of the first episode I felt like I'd already experienced the whole show.

Youjo Senki: Dropped after 1 episode. It was really ugly. I don't really care about war settings either.

Gakkougurashi: Yea I fucking love this show. It was tailor-made for me.

Yu-Gi-Oh: Big part of my childhood. I still enjoy it because of nostalgia.

Rewrite: This is the worst show I have ever seen. I usually tend to have a problem with adaptations of VN's. I just feel like they don't adapt well to animation but this was just so lifeless and nonsensical.

Attack on Titan: I explained this elsewhere in this thread.

They looking at a people who were brutally burdered and had their eyes and teeth gouged out and being like ""oh, ok, I'll stay here for a whlie longer"" instead of getting the fuck out asap. The police being stopped by a mere rainy bridge. The hypocritic irony of a believer who sincerely sympathizes with another believer shenanigans while he tries to prove those shenanigans were bullshit in first place. And so on. (I'm also not really a fan of horror mystery)

But there are also things I like. Like how these people are all going to get fucked by the end. Science, bitch! Take that.... huh. lionzol? Or whatever. Thermal cameras. Salinity tests. Chemistry, motherfucker! I'm no scientist so I'm half-sure some bullshit science is going to spring out eventually if it hasn't already, but I'd rather blindfully believe the science works than a statue cries. To each its own religion, I guess.

I also like how every time that MC sends an e-mail asking for something he gets an answer instantly. I guess I'll keep watching just to find out how is that even possible.

Presumably Monogatari's reputation would suffer similarly if that were really the motivating factor. Yet I only really see it leveled at Haruhi.

Fuuka bad reputation comes mainly from manga readers. It's not a bad show on itself, is a decent highschool drama.

59239,"Not everyone can agree that KyoAni tells the best stories.  But I think we can all agree they have the best movement and detail in TV animation.  

Movement is an often overlooked aspect of visual story-telling.  As is the ability to express something without dumping it into dialogue.  But it can easily be abused.  Some animated stuff (especially Disney movies or heavy CGI movies like Transformers) try to have characters moving every single frame.  And it is not only taxing to watch, but it breaks the suspension of disbelief.  Even in a live action movie, there will be times when a person stands still.  And so when animators have a character always expressing themselves with hand gestures or shifting their body weight in every single scene, it throws your mind off.  It looks ""unrealistic"", despite actually having more detail and emotion put into it.  This is also why you can watch a movie like Star Wars and the CGI just doesn't look right.  Because the human will be moving relatively little but the CGI alien interacting with him looks like its moving at 120 fps and never sits still.  Always some kind of mouth movement or a little twitch in the eye or the hairs on its head keep blowing in a non existent breeze...it's a mess.

KyoAni on the other hand has found a happy medium.  Despite a much bigger budget than most animation, the majority of their work still has characters who are relatively still for most scenes.  Long patches of Hyouka or Maid Dragon will have continuous frames where characters don't move beyond eye blinks or turning their head.  And that's perfectly fine.  They save the emphasis on movement for the scenes where it is needed.  When a character is reacting to something or when a character is nervous or when a character starts talking, then you will see some movement.  And I very much appreciate it.  Same as when Ghibli and Production IG do it.

It is especially noticeable with Kanna in Maid Dragon.  Her lack of movement and subtle reactions to things are a running gag on the show.  How she moves helps develop her character even more than what she says in dialogue.  And it just wouldn't work if she was always bobbing around like your average anime child.",anime

[Oh wow, I see why people ship Oscar and Rosalie.](http://i.imgur.com/mbwScZV.png)  

A lot of stuff happened in this episode.  
We see that Rosalie is completely in love with Oscar. And more important than that, Rosalie knows that she's in love with Oscar. But she thinks that she cannot declare her love, which is understandable considering the time.  
Unfortunately, Polignac was sick and couldn't go to the ball. We instead met her daughter, Charlotte, who's also an unpleasant character. Like mother, like daughter, I guess.  

Jeanne is back, still doing what she does best: lying. At least in this episode she seems to feel a bit of sadness about her mother's death, even though she didn't show it. Or maybe it was just her surprise to see Rosalie here.  
I really liked [this shot](http://i.imgur.com/N8Myava.png) by the way. It really shows the two different personality of the sisters. One is cold, with a look a la du Barry, aiming for money and power. The other one is fragile and unsure, she's also lying but she only wants revenge.  

Nothing is more satisfying that Oscar being Oscar: she stood up against Polignac and even asked that Charlotte apologize!

I like cooking a lot, especially for somebody else. I would cook a lot in retirement no matter what, so I don't mind having to double up the portions. Cleaning I don't really care for, but it's tolerable, and I would have a ton of free time anyways. It would be nice to make a close friend's life easier.

Additionally, Japanese people are generally a lot busier, and often don't have a lot of time and/or means to simply watch or rewatch potentially a 50+ episode series in order to see a new movie. Watching a few recap movies, however, is probably the easiest way to introduce new people to a series, as well as to refresh the minds of existing viewers before something like Madoka Rebellion or a new season of Lelouch.

Lastly, like other people have said, recap movies are a relatively cheap and easy way for companies to generate revenue for an existing IP, while also helping to boost sales and ratings for any future releases.

Perspective in anime is a funny thing: objects look further away than they really would be; streets, halls, sidewalks are all wider than the actually would be; business are *much* larger than they actually are; etc, etc. It's the biggest reason no one in Japan has sex, and the concept of Love Hotels even exists in the first place: people can literally hear *everything* around them above a whisper.

All that to say that Tendou *absolutely* could hear Amano ranting at Tasuku from her vantage point. Not to mention that while what she's doing is *definitely* stalking, it was never stalking on a level of affection but rather stalking like you see constantly in anime of a club recruiter, which is actually fairly normal to happen if not still very weird.

So Tendou's heel-face *dere* turn isn't out of left-field, or *just happens*. There's clear build up, and they've basically been blaring it in your face since the opening sequence of the first episode with the giant yellow letters denoting her fall from grace being Amano's fault.

I really do love the little interactions that are easy to pass over between the girls. [This one](http://imgur.com/ouUFw27) from the beginning of the episode was particularly nice. As Umi talks about Love Live, she just casually glances at Honoka. It’s a nice little moment that reflects what we learned last season (Regardless of my thoughts) about just how much Kotori cares about and admires Honoka. She knows how much this must mean to her. Another thing I re-noticed this episode was [Honoka’s attitude to A-RISE.](http://imgur.com/46xji78) She always uses them as a jumping off point, never letting their Idol-prowess, or whatever, get her down. In a competition like this one, that might be her true best asset for the team.

I'm not aware of any license that's divvied up by country in its totality, but I could be wrong - it's not like I'm looking at license agreements on a daily basis, but then again, no one here is either, so it's always a little frustrating to see things like this stated with such certainty. Trying to assess motivation is also very odd - wouldn't you want your anime to be seen by the most people possible? The anime industry in Japan values things like relationships and what the fans want more than looking at dollars and cents (and even if that weren't the case, a particular individual on the internet may not be the best judge of what's the most profit-maximizing way to do business on an international stage).

Licenses are grouped usually by region, and every region is organized differently by each publisher. You can find out what publisher Crunchyroll is licensing from on the show page, but there's certainly some nuance to that. You'll find trends by publisher, which reveal some interesting licensing insights if you pay close enough attention, but broadly, it comes down to competition. If it were as straightforward as a menu of countries that you could purchase, sure, that'd be helpful, but without going into too much detail, that's just not how licensing works, and that doesn't consider opportunity cost on the side of publishers in a world where every region has its own players.

When Crunchyroll licenses anime, we try to get as many countries as possible. For anime licensed from other Western partners, like Love Live Sunshine!! (via Funimation), we're limited to the countries that the partner licensed for. Funimation, for example, previously only had service available in the English-speaking world, so it didn't make sense for them to license globally - even if they want the rights for regions they don't immediately serve, the publisher would be most interested in local partners who are most capable of exploiting the most rights (local TV, localized merchandise, home video, etc.).

So for this title in particular, getting additional rights just wasn't on the table necessarily, and the process of changing the rights available is unbearably complex. It's a frustrating reality, but that's where we are. I'm really excited about CR's upcoming Summer line-up, keep track of how many of the titles are available in 150+ countries ;)",anime

Also there's Young black Jack, Tiger Mask W, Lupin III (2015) and Case Closed in regards to classics. Eyeshield 21 could also be considered a classic sports anime, it did air quite a while ago.

Objectively, this is a non-issue. Speaking from publishing experience, ANN did the bare minimum and retracted the insensitive bit, and they actually didn't have to since this was a review, which is usually taken as an opinion column. Although if it's their own staff doing the review, they have to stand behind his/her perspective even though it isn't the entire editorial board's opinion (unless it's an editorial), so that's probably a factor as well.

That said, I'm fairly sure if no one died they would never have bothered with getting rid of the snark in the first place. Kinda hints that it may be time to review quality standards on what gets published.

- [Onegai Twins](http://myanimelist.net/anime/196/Onegai%E2%98%86Twins) is about a boy who still has an old picture of a blue house in his old hometown with a boy and a girl playing in a small pool just outside of it. In search for his familiy he moves back to this blue house and two girls show up at his door, both having a copy of the old picture and both claim to be his twin.

- [Candy Boy](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4535/Candy_Boy:_Nonchalant_Talk_of_the_Certain_Twin_Sisters_in_Daily_Life) is about two sisters that share a room together in the dorms at their high school. One day a girl from their school seeks out one of the sisters. The other one shortly after learns from a friend that said girl admired her sister for a long time now. Various events lead to the second sister confessing her feelings for the other one.

- [Boku wa Imouto ni Koi wo Suru](http://myanimelist.net/anime/819/Boku_wa_Imouto_ni_Koi_wo_Suru) follows a brother/sister relationship. The siblings were always close as kids and still live in the same room with bunker beds. The brother tho is in love with his sister and the whole 'forbidden love' thing is causing him sleepless nights. He tries to stay away from her (what confuses her because they are normally really close), applies to attend a boarding school and even tries to ease his desire for his sister by sleeping with her best friend. When his sister started talking about having a boyfriend he couldn't stay quiet anymore and confessed.

- [**Koi Kaze (recommendation)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/634/Koi_Kaze) is about a man who works as a wedding planer and isn't able to commit himself wholeheartedly to love because of it. After being dumped by his girlfriend he had a chance encounter with a female high school student which shakes his calm and awakens new feelings in him. Shortly after he learns that this girl is in fact his sister that lived with his mother who divorced his dad many years ago and is now staying with him and his dad.

- [**Yosuga no Sora: In Solitude, Where We Are Least Alone. (recommendation)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8861/Yosuga_no_Sora:_In_Solitude_Where_We_Are_Least_Alone.) is about a brother and his sister who just lost their parents in an accident. They move to a rural town where they once spent summers with their grandfather. Everything seems familiar and peaceful until the brother starts to remember things from his youth. (This anime is a visual novel adaption and tries to go into every girls' route. As an example that isn't accurate.. They will show the intro story followed seemlessly by the start of girl route A.. When the story finishes you'll notice that it goes a bit back in time to an intersection point and follows the next girls story. Everything is tied up with the last 3 episodes or so being about the siblings themselves... (best arc))

- [**Kiss x Sis (ohhh yesssss)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7593/Kiss_x_Sis_(TV) is borderline hentai. No actual full on sex involved but you'll like it. There are also 12 OVAs.

- [OniAi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14199/Oniichan_dakedo_Ai_Sae_Areba_Kankeinai_yo_ne!) is a comedy ecchi harem that also involves a sister lusting for her brother but she gets clam jammed everytime because of a harem slowly forming around him...

- [NAKAIMO - My Little Sister Is Among Them!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13367/Kono_Naka_ni_Hitori_Imouto_ga_Iru!) has a nice setup for a story but is actually just another comedy ecchi harem. Guys' father dies and he only gets the inheritance if he attends a certain school and finds someone to marry. The only problem is that a girl from this school claims to be his sister but he doesn't know who exactly. Can he find his future bride without picking the sister?

- [Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11179/Papa_no_Iukoto_wo_Kikinasai!) is not really incesty but it has a nice premise that confronts the problems of suddenly being a dad. Imagine a sister and a brother that lost their parents. The sister raised his brother alone until she married years later... She asks him to take care of her 3 daughters (two of them coming from her husbands earlier marriages and a really young one being her own) while she is on a trip with her husband. He unwillingly accepts the job but the plane his sister took went missing. In order to prevent the daughters from being adopted separately by relatives, Yuta decided to take in all three girls and raise them like his sister raised him.

- [**Oreimo (The most popular)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8769/Ore_no_Imouto_ga_Konnani_Kawaii_Wake_ga_Nai) follows a broken brother/sister relationship. One day he finds a DVD of a magical girl anime in the entranceway of his house. To his surprise there was actually an eroge (adult video game) titled Imouto to Koishiyo! (Love with Little Sister!) in it. He tries to finds out who the owner is by bringing up the topic of magical girl anime at the family dinner table. All that comes out is a strong negative reaction from his parents, especially his anti-otaku policeman father. In the same night his sister bursts into his room and, in perhaps the first conversation she has initiated with him in years, says they ""have things to talk about."" She brings him to her room and shows him an extensive collection of moe anime and lolicon bishoujo games she has been collecting in secret.",anime

Cant say I much like the look of this website either. For one it makes it look like almost all of their back catalog is dub only, but its actually not when you go on it? Then theres a dubs and TV section which seem to be mostly the same. A movies section, but i only see OVAs in it? They have children who chase lost voices as the movies banner, but it isnt available? Its also a bit of a hard website to find. If you google for stuff like sentai streaming uk, hidive etc it doesnt actually come up. Looks like subs are free, and dubs you need a subscription for. At $4 per month (not sure why its showing in dollars for me in the UK) its not terrible i guess, but HD is only 720p and the quality of alot of the dubs is dubious.

EDIT: Clkicking around is a bit odd, I cant seem to watch any of the 'movies' (OVAs) sub or dub but it doesnt say anything about that in the benefits of subbing to them.

Nope, he didn't cheat. The mechanic of restriction and vow is explained quite thoroughly, and he doesn't get a free pass. Even so, Kurapika becoming the 'hunter' of the Spiders allows us to see the human side of the Spiders: how they really feel about their boss and the team, how they react to being hunted, etc. We wouldn't have gotten that without Kurapika being the aggressor.

Plus, Togashi didn't take the easy route out and have Kurapika slaughter all of the Spiders. He only killed Uvogin, which allows for us to see how the Spiders react. We also see how strong the Spiders are against everyone other than Kurapika, and they are anything but pushovers. Watch the Chrollo vs Zoldycks fight again. He wasn't even being serious and took on Zeno and Silva blow for blow.

Didn't they annihilate the whole mafia in the YC arc? It was like 10 guys vs 2000+. Seems pretty genocidal to me. Plus they were hyped up as thieves from the start, Kurapika explained they committed genocide on the Kurta clan for the Scarlet Eyes.

**Why starting with Fate/Zero is dumb**

Fate/Zero was created with the intention of never being the starting point or an introduction to Fate or Typemoon. It's meant to be read after Fate/Stay Night.

You don't fucking watch Kizumonogatari first just because it looks nicer than Bake and that Bake spoils some of Kizu. Everyone agrees that would be dumb as fuck. 

**What's wrong with starting with UBW?**

It might be a little confusing without the fate route since that's the ""world building"" and introductory route, but other than that there's no issue. 

**What about DEEN's adaptation?**

It barely spoils anything about HF and spoils some of UBW. It also looks like shit. The real issue is that it straight up looks worse than the VN. If you are ok with the shit animation and are willing to sit through it and watch UBW after then it's a perfectly alright place to start. ",anime

69246,"First time watcher, first time participating in a rewatch, have posted in most of the threads.

Well now we know why the show's called Love Live. The show's plot moved forward heavily - we had progress on the student council president, saving the school, improving the girls, and figuring out who was filming things. The episode was so dense with plot and characterization that I went back and watched it again.

Hanayo was pretty adorable nerding out over the idols; she really does become a different person when she gets to let out her inner otaku.

Maki is back to being best girl and being the mature voice of reason. For a first-year she seems like the oldest of them. Her embarrassment at being photographed was incredibly endearing, and her fearless confrontation of the student council president was an awesome moment.

With the exception of the breast-grabbing, I was a big fan of how frequently Nico got shut down. I mean, on top of Honoka shutting down Nico's attempt to show off how informed she was, they literally shoved her into a room and closed the door. I actually felt bad for her on the first viewing; on the second, I realized she was being obnoxiously self-important. And while Nico is clearly not book smart or as smart as she thinks she is, I thought her attempt to use her Nico-Nico personality to improve her studies was smart. She has some depth to her.

I know that Honoka is a bit of an airhead, but her math skills are just... a whole series of educators failed that poor girl. I liked seeing her back in her casual outfit; I just really love that look.

Eli's development was probably the most interesting thing about the episode. The revelation that she's being such a raging colossal bitch to the idols because she thinks she's better than them isn't a huge surprise; the fact that she actually has reason to believe that to be true is. And she does clearly care about her family; she's got that Russian coldness, but she loves her sister and her grandmother - and the school that her grandmother loved as a child. I hope she takes an enormous chill pill, because while I like her characterization and writing, I'd like to like the character, ya know?

Cultural notes: I get the feeling that a Live is a term for a concert or something in Japan. The show showed how seriously the senpai/kouhai relationship are taken when Maki backed down on her confrontation with Eli. I think maybe that contributes to why the girls didn't go screaming to the cops when Nozomi kept repeatedly assaulting them. Like, I get to a certain extent that there's a trope in anime that ""it's okay if they're both girls,"" and I feel like that contributed to me being less appalled than I thought I would be when I saw it. That, and the first girl to get the ""treatment"" was Nico, who I love to hate. I felt disturbed with myself for feeling like it was normal.

Also, I finished Re:Zero, and I noticed that Subaru from that show used the -chi honorific as well. In that show, it implied great familiarity and also a certain babying/moetization. It was very interesting to me that Nozomi kept referring to Eli with the -chi honorific, implying greater closeness between them than I expected. On the other hand, she also used -chin for Honoka, and she *clearly* has issues with people's boundaries and propriety, so maybe that's just how she is.

As an educator I was interested to see Honoka's grades - grades in other anime seem to be out of 100, but she got a 53. That wouldn't be a pass in most educational systems I know of, but I get the impression that there's more room for individual differentiation in the Japanese system, with maybe overall harder tests with a lower pass threshold. I wish I could read the smaller moon runes under her grade; freeze-framing it didn't help. The first character looks like a squashed ""100,"" maybe, but I think it's just illegible.",anime

It's *at least* a top 5 composition in my book because of how simple yet effective the layering of the various elements is. There's never a section longer than maybe 8 seconds without some layer variation, be it the vocals, the bass, the guitar, the violin, the beat, whatever. Yet usually only one or two layers change at a time, so it remains very smooth listening without ever stagnating; the song's energy is derived from both subtle and overt sources. It's also perfectly representative of the franchise as a whole from visual/sound design and emotional perspectives, and it's catchy as hell to boot.


I legit have to resist typing out any more because this song is *criminally* underrated for the amount of depth it packs, and I almost never get the chance to talk about it since not many people care about it relative to other songs. I'll have to restrain myself again once we reach that point in the rewatch.",anime

It was beautifully animated and had some interesting plot that kept me going with the series, but the first episode didn't draw me in as much as this one.

This episode introduced a ton of story elements without explaining everything outright, yet I never felt completely lost. On rewatching some scenes and reading people's explanations, I see all the extra details that I missed on the first go around, and see how pretty much every scene had a purpose. And I'm also really enjoying the aesthetic of this show as well. A lot of the backgrounds and scenery is just really well done.
