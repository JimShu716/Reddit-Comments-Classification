### Abstract:
In this project, we investigated approaches to
accomplish natural language processing and classification. A
data set with 100000 comments extracted from Reddit is
used to train and validate the model accuracy. Some Python
classes were used to help in the feature extraction and model
building. Uni-gram Bag-of-words are used as the feature pattern
when extracting the features from corpse. After investigation
of various classifiers, we have constructed an ensemble of
classifiers thatâ€™s able to classify comments that acquired from a
limited subreddits in Reddit. The result of prediction maintains
over 58.7%, with no additional data required. And we achieved the 9th among 98 teams in Kaggle Competition. Classifiers which
has a outstanding performance in the classification of matrix
produced from natural language has been recorded.
